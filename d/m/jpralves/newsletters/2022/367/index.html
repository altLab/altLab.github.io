<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1857, o matemático alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Bolza">Oskar Bolza</a>. Ele publicou The elliptic s-functions considerado como um caso especial das s-funções hiperelípticas em 1900. A partir de 1910, ele trabalhou no cálculo das variações. Bolza escreveu um livro clássico sobre o assunto, Lectures on the Calculus of Variations (1904). Voltou à Alemanha em 1910, onde pesquisou a teoria das funções, as equações integrais e o cálculo das variações. Em 1913, publicou um artigo que apresentava um novo tipo de problema de variações, agora chamado "o problema de Bolza". No ano seguinte, escreveu sobre variações para um problema integral envolvendo desigualdades, que mais tarde se tornaram importantes na teoria do controlo.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1895, o químico e físico norte-americano nascido no Canadá <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Giauque">William Giauque</a>. Ele recebeu o Prémio Nobel da Química em 1949 pelos seus "feitos no campo da termodinâmica química e especialmente o seu trabalho sobre o comportamento da matéria a temperaturas muito baixas e os seus estudos estreitamente aliados da entropia". É recordado particularmente pela sua descoberta da desmagnetização adiabática como meio para atingir temperaturas próximas do zero absoluto, bem como pelos seus exaustivos e meticulosos estudos termodinâmicos, ao longo de uma vida inteira de investigação, que utilizaram a terceira lei da termodinâmica, ao mesmo tempo que desenvolveram um grande conjunto de provas para a sua validade.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1910, a bioquímica inglesa <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Hodgkin">Dorothy Hodgkin</a>. Ela recebeu o Prémio Nobel da Química em 1964 pelas suas descobertas, pela utilização de técnicas de raios X, da estrutura de moléculas biologicamente importantes, incluindo a penicilina (1946), a vitamina B-12 (1956), e mais tarde, a hormona proteica insulina (1969). As suas realizações incluíram não só estas determinações de estrutura e o conhecimento científico que elas proporcionaram, mas também o desenvolvimento de métodos que tornaram possíveis tais determinações de estrutura.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1939, o inventor norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Hull">Chuck Hull</a>. Ele é um dos inventores da impressora SLA 3D, a primeira tecnologia de prototipagem rápida comercial, e do formato de ficheiro STL amplamente utilizado. É nomeado em mais de 60 patentes dos EUA, bem como outras patentes em todo o mundo nos campos da óptica de iões e da prototipagem rápida. Foi empossado no Hall da Fama dos Inventores Nacionais em 2014 e em 2017 foi um dos primeiros empossados no Hall da Fama do TCT.</p>

<p>Em 1936, o teclado da máquina de escrever Dvorak foi patenteado nos EUA por Dvorak e Dealey (Patente No. 2,040,248). Os peritos em eficiência August Dvorak (um primo do compositor) e William Dealey estudaram a máquina de escrever para determinar que poderiam arranjar as teclas de uma nova forma que aceleraria os operadores da máquina de escrever. Conceberam um teclado para maximizar a eficiência, colocando letras comuns na fila de casa, e fazer com que os dedos mais fortes das mãos fizessem a maior parte do trabalho. Em contraste, a disposição original QWERTY foi concebida para as máquinas de escrever anteriores, menos eficientes. Anteriormente, a velocidade resultaria em duas barras de tipo a baterem uma na outra nas suas viagens, pelo que o teclado original foi disposto de forma a reduzir colisões.</p>

<p>Em 1941, Konrad Zuse completou o primeiro computador programável totalmente funcional do mundo (Turing-complete computer), a sua máquina Z3. Foi também o primeiro computador do género a utilizar o sistema binário em vez do sistema decimal. Era um computador digital electromecânico construído com 2.400 relés. Os programas eram introduzidos a partir de rolos perfurados de película de filme de descarte. Notavelmente, o Z3 era programável, enquanto que o Atanasoff binário ABC (1942) e o ENIAC (1945-46) desenvolvidos independentemente eram calculadoras de propósito especial, nenhum dos quais era livremente programável. A Z3 foi utilizada pela indústria aeronáutica alemã para resolver sistemas de equações simultâneas e aspectos matemáticos da vibração das estruturas de ar sob tensão. Foi destruída em 1944 durante os bombardeamentos da II Guerra Mundial.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou foi lançada a distribuição Fedora 36 da RedHat. As grandes novidades são o Kernel de Linux 5.17 e o GNOME 42. Outras novidades igualmente interessantes são o podman 4.0, o Ruby 3.1, o Golang 1.18, o PHP 8.1 e o GCC 12. Trata-se de uma distribuição que usa versões bastante recentes dos mais importantes pacotes de software Open Source e que sem dúvida é uma distro sólida.</p>

<h2><a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-36/">Announcing Fedora Linux 36</a></h2>

<p><em>"Today, I’m excited to share the results of the hard work of thousands of Fedora Project contributors: our latest release, Fedora Linux 36, is here! By the community, for the community Normally when I write these announcements, I talk about some of the great technical changes in the release. This time, I wanted to put the focus on the community that makes those changes happen. Fedora isn’t just a group of people toiling away in isolation — we’re friends. In fact, that’s one of our Four Foundations. One of our newest Fedora Friends, Juan Carlos Araujo said it beautifully in a Fedora Discussion post: Besides functionality, stability, features, how it works under the hood, and how cutting-edge it is, I think what makes or breaks a distro are those intangibles, like documentation and the community."</em> <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-36/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"NASA-funded study breaks new ground in plant research In the early days of the space age, the Apollo astronauts took part in a visionary plan: Bring samples of the lunar surface material, known as regolith, back to Earth where they could be studied with state-of-the-art equipment and saved for future research not yet imagined. Fifty years later, at the dawn of the Artemis era and the next astronaut return to the Moon, three of those samples have been used to successfully grow plants. For the first time ever, researchers have grown the hardy and well-studied Arabidopsis thaliana in the nutrient-poor lunar regolith. “This research is critical to NASA’s long-term human exploration goals as we’ll need to use resources found on the Moon and Mars to develop food sources for future astronauts living and operating in deep space,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. “This fundamental plant growth research is also a key example of how NASA is working to unlock agricultural innovations that could help us understand how plants might overcome stressful conditions in food-scarce areas here on Earth.” Scientists at the University of Florida have made a breakthrough discovery — decades in the making — that could both enable space exploration and benefit humanity. “Here we are, 50 years later, completing experiments that were started back in the Apollo labs,” said Robert Ferl, a professor in the Horticultural Sciences department at the University of Florida, Gainesville, and a communicating author on a paper published on May 12, 2022, in Communications Biology."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/biological-physical/scientists-grow-plants-in-soil-from-the-moon">[...]</a>

The first 10 years of the LHC have cemented the Standard Model (SM) as the correct theory of known fundamental particle interactions. But unexplained phenomena such as the cosmological matter–antimatter asymmetry, neutrino masses and dark matter strongly suggest the existence of new physics beyond the current direct reach of the LHC. As a dedicated heavy-flavour physics experiment, LHCb is ideally placed to allow physicists to look beyond this horizon. Measurements of the subtle effects that new particles can have on SM processes are fully complementary to searches for the direct production of new particles in high-energy collisions. As-yet unknown particles could contribute to the mixing and decay of beauty and charm hadrons, for example, leading to departures from the SM in decay rates, CP-violating asymmetries and other measurements."</em> <a href="https://cerncourier.com/a/velos-voyage-into-the-unknown/">[...]</a>

Wireless systems are moving to the mmWave spectrum at 10-100 gigahertz (GHz), above crowded cellular frequencies as well as early 5G systems around 3 GHz. System operators tend to prefer lower bands of the new mmWave spectrum. One reason is that they are influenced by a formula that says more signals are lost at higher frequencies due to smaller wavelengths resulting in a smaller useful antenna area. But until now, measurements of this effect by many organizations have disagreed over whether this is true. NIST researchers developed a new method to measure frequency effects, using the 26.5-40 GHz band as a target example."</em> <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/05/nist-finds-wireless-performance-consistent-across-5g-millimeter-wave-bands">[...]</a>

Nevidomskyy is hoping that will change based on the computational sleuthing he and colleagues from Rice, Florida State University and the Max Planck Institute for Physics of Complex Systems in Dresden, Germany, published this month in the open-access journal npj Quantum Materials."</em> <a href="https://news.rice.edu/news/2022/computational-sleuthing-confirms-first-3d-quantum-spin-liquid">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The facility, LCLS-II, will soon sharpen our view of how nature works on ultrasmall, ultrafast scales, impacting everything from quantum devices to clean energy. Nestled 30 feet underground in Menlo Park, California, a half-mile-long stretch of tunnel is now colder than most of the universe. It houses a new superconducting particle accelerator, part of an upgrade project to the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) X-ray free-electron laser at the Department of Energy’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. Crews have successfully cooled the accelerator to minus 456 degrees Fahrenheit – or 2 kelvins – a temperature at which it becomes superconducting and can boost electrons to high energies with nearly zero energy lost in the process. It is one of the last milestones before LCLS-II will produce X-ray pulses that are 10,000 times brighter, on average, than those of LCLS and that arrive up to a million times per second – a world record for today’s most powerful X-ray light sources. “In just a few hours, LCLS-II will produce more X-ray pulses than the current laser has generated in its entire lifetime,” says Mike Dunne, director of LCLS."</em> <a href="https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/news/2022-05-10-slacs-superconducting-x-ray-laser-reaches-operating-temperature-colder-outer-space">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Very thin wires made of a topological insulator could enable highly stable qubits, the building blocks of future quantum computers. Scientists see a new result in topological insulator devices as an important step towards realizing the technology’s potential. An international group of scientists have demonstrated that wires more than 100 times thinner than a human hair can act like a quantum one-way street for electrons when made of a peculiar material known as a topological insulator. The discovery opens the pathway for new technological applications of devices made from topological insulators and demonstrates a significant step on the road to achieving so-called topological qubits, which it has been predicted can robustly encode information for a quantum computer. To achieve this result, the groups of Professor Dr. Jelena Klinovaja and Professor Dr. Daniel Loss at the University of Basel closely collaborated with experimental physicists at the University of Cologne in the group of Professor Dr. Yoichi Ando.

<p><em>"Discarded tree forks could replace load-bearing joints in architecture projects using a construction technique developed by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The system combines generative design and robotic fabrication to allow tree forks – the pieces of wood where a trunk or branch splits into two – to be used as the Y-shaped nodes that connect straight building elements. Created by the Digital Structures research group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the five-step approach has already been used to install a demonstration structure on the university's campus, with a larger pavilion now in the works. The researchers believe their system could reduce the environmental impact of construction by offering a replacement for high-strength but emissions-intensive virgin materials such as steel, which are usually needed to form structural components. In comparison, tree forks are not just natural and renewable but also a reclaimed waste product from the timber industry, which uses only the straight sections of trees to create furniture and building materials. Caitlin Mueller, associate professor in the Building Technology programme at MIT and leader of the Digital Structures research group, describes tree forks as "naturally engineered structural connections" that can transfer force very efficiently thanks to their internal fibre network."</em> <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2022/05/05/tree-forks-mit-digital-structures-architecture/">[...]</a>

In a paper published today in Nature Nanotechnology, the international team have produced the first proof that networks of nanomagnets can be used to perform AI-like processing. The researchers showed nanomagnets can be used for ‘time-series prediction’ tasks, such as predicting and regulating insulin levels in diabetic patients. Artificial intelligence that uses ‘neural networks’ aims to replicate the way parts of the brain work, where neurons talk to each other to process and retain information.

<p><em>"Solid-state nanophotonic technology could potentially replace cabinets of equipment. Rice University photonics researchers have created a potentially disruptive technology for the ultraviolet optics market. By precisely etching hundreds of tiny triangles on the surface of a microscopic film of zinc oxide, nanophotonics pioneer Naomi Halas and colleagues created a “metalens” that transforms incoming long-wave UV (UV-A) into a focused output of vacuum UV (VUV) radiation. VUV is used in semiconductor manufacturing, photochemistry and materials science and has historically been costly to work with, in part because it is absorbed by almost all types of glass used to make conventional lenses. “This work is particularly promising in light of recent demonstrations that chip manufacturers can scale up the production of metasurfaces with CMOS-compatible processes,” said Halas, co-corresponding author of a metalens demonstration study published in Science Advances. “This is a fundamental study, but it clearly points to a new strategy for high-throughput manufacturing of compact VUV optical components and devices.” Halas' team showed its microscopic metalens could convert 394-nanometer UV into a focused output of 197-nanometer VUV."</em> <a href="https://news.rice.edu/news/2022/rice-metalens-could-disrupt-vacuum-uv-market">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Last year, I introduced MCUGotchi, a Tamagotchi P1 emulator for microcontrollers, that worked on an STM32F0 development board. Today, I am pleased to announce the support of a new board in MCUGotchi: OpenTama ! OpenTama is an open source development board created by Sparkr, the company I co-founded. It has been specifically designed for MCUGotchi using KiCad and has everything a virtual pet needs, and even more, in a small and nice form factor. It features: - a low-power STM32L072CBT MCU - either a backlit 128x64 LCD UC1701x or a 128x64 OLED SSD1306 display - an RGB LED for notifications - a piezoelectric speaker - a 1000mAh battery - a USB C connector for data and charging - three buttons Being an open source hardware design, anyone can manufacture his/her own board. Furthermore, all components have been placed on the top side of the board, so that the assembly as well can be performed by EMS such as JLCPCB, even for small quantities (references for the various parts are included in the project)."</em> <a href="http://blog.rona.fr/post/2022/04/21/OpenTama-an-open-source-reference-design-for-MCUGotchi">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Measuring the capacity of a battery As a boat owner, I always wanted to know the capacity of a used battery. Not the charge state, not the internal resistance, but how many Ampere-hours the battery can actually contain. A partially worn-out battery can obviously contain less than the rated Ah. The standardized way to rate a new battery is Ah = 20 * (the current that the battery can be loaded by for 20 hours). So to measure it, load the fully charged battery with 1/20 of the rated Ah (keeping the current constant while the voltage decreases), then measure the time until the voltage is below the threshold, typically 10.5V for a 12V battery. If it turns out to be 20 hours, you are happy to have a fresh battery; if it is, say, 10 hours, then the battery has lost half it's capacity."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/monse53/12v-battery-capacity-tester-fb95b9">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.instructables.com/LDR-Color-Sensor/">LDR Color Sensor</a></h2>

<p><em>"With the intention of building a cheap and simple color sensor to do projects with our students, we found an idea that seemed to allow us to do this with a simple LDR photoresistor and an RGB LED. Let's see how we combine both components and use it with micro:bit to build a simple color ball sorting machine. The key to the operation of the color sensor is that applying for example a red light to a red object will reflect a higher intensity of light than if we apply green or blue light to the same red object. So we put the photoresistor next to the LED and emit a series of colored pulses from the latter. Reading the analogue value obtained in the photoresistor for each color pulse, we should be able to perceive differences depending on the color of the object we put in front of it, which should allow us to differentiate colors (second picture). It will not be a very accurate sensor, but well calibrated it can be useful in many situations."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/LDR-Color-Sensor/">[...]</a>

It is a very simple representation of decimal numbers in different ways, so you can google BCD or binary coded decimal on google. Why did I make this? I want to make a watch which has led, so instead of a simple watch I came with a unique idea.

This time I used the same robot, but now I have added a Bluetooth controller so that now motions can be controlled by the user by giving specific voice commands. The speech is received and processed on a Smartphone which then sends commands to the Robot. A few years ago I made a similar project that uses the same Android application, which is a home automation system and you can see it on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOYRwkNQz0w&amp;t=8s.
