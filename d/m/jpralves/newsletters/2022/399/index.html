<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1732, o industrialista e inventor inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Arkwright">Richard Arkwright</a>. Ele ficou conhecido por ter introduzido métodos de produção de fábricas têxteis mecanizados e motorizados que foi enormemente bem sucedida. A máquina Spinning-Frame que ele inventou (1769, patente britânica nº 931) para fiar fio de algodão utilizava múltiplos conjuntos de rolos emparelhados que giravam a diferentes velocidades capazes de extrair fio com a espessura correcta, e um conjunto de fusos para torcer as fibras firmemente juntas. Produziu um fio muito mais forte do que o fio feito pela Spinning-Jenny de James Hargreaves. A máquina de Arkwright era demasiado grande para ser accionada manualmente, por isso ele alimentou-a com uma roda de água (1771) quando ficou conhecida como a Moldura de Água. O negócio têxtil de Arkwright expandiu-se, ele construiu mais fábricas, e mais tarde adoptou a força do vapor.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1765, o matemático alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Friedrich_Pfaff">Johann Friedrich Pfaff</a>. Ele propôs o primeiro método geral de integração de equações diferenciais parciais da primeira ordem. Pfaff fez um trabalho importante sobre funções especiais e a teoria das séries. Ele desenvolveu o Teorema de Taylor utilizando a forma com o restante como dado por Lagrange. Em 1810 contribuiu para a solução de um problema devido a Gauss relativo à elipse da maior área que podia ser desenhada dentro de um determinado quadrilátero. O seu trabalho mais importante sobre as formas de Pfaff foi publicado em 1815, quando tinha quase 50 anos, mas a sua importância só foi reconhecida em 1827, quando Jacobi publicou um artigo sobre o método de Pfaff.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1799, o físico irlandês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Callan">Nicholas Callan</a>. Ele foi pioneiro na ciência eléctrica. Ele inventou a bobina de indução (1836) antes da do mais conhecido Heinrich Ruhmkorff. A bobina de Callan foi construída utilizando uma bobina de ferro em forma de ferradura com uma bobina secundária de fio isolado fino sob um enrolamento separado de fio isolado grosso como bobina "primária". Cada vez que a corrente de uma bateria através da bobina "primária" era interrompida, uma corrente de alta tensão era produzida na bobina "secundária" separada electricamente. Em 1837, Callan utilizou um mecanismo de relógio para abanar um fio dentro e fora de um pequeno copo de mercúrio para interromper o circuito 20 vezes/segundo numa máquina de indução gigante, produzindo faíscas de 15 polegadas (estimadas em 600.000 volts).</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1876, o engenheiro e metalúrgico sueco-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Waldemar_Elmen">Gustav Waldemar Elmen</a>. Ele criou a Permalloy (1916) e ligas conexas com alta permeabilidade magnética utilizadas em equipamento de comunicações. Uma liga com esta propriedade pode ser facilmente magnetizada e desmagnetizada, especialmente útil para aplicações em equipamento eléctrico, telefones e outros sistemas de comunicações. Desenvolveu a Permalloy de níquel-ferro em 1916, para a Western Electric Company (mais tarde Bell Telephone Laboratories). Mais tarde, em 1923, Elmen descobriu que a permeabilidade magnética poderia ser dramaticamente aumentada se Permalloy fosse tratada com calor. A sua permeabilidade magnética excedeu a do aço de silício. A sua descoberta tornou possível cabos telegráficos de grande capacidade de transporte de mensagens em alto mar.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1887, o matemático indiano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan">Srinivasa Ramanujan</a>. Ele fez um notável trabalho sobre séries hipergeométricas e fracções contínuas. Na teoria dos números, ele descobriu propriedades da função de partição. Embora autodidacta, ele foi um dos maiores génios matemáticos da Índia. Trabalhou em funções elípticas, fracções contínuas, e séries infinitas. A sua notável familiaridade com os números, foi demonstrada pelo incidente seguinte. Enquanto Ramanujan estava no hospital em Inglaterra, o seu professor de Cambridge, G. H. Hardy, visitou e observou que tinha apanhado o táxi número 1729, um número singularmente inexcepcional. Ramanujan respondeu imediatamente que este número era de facto bastante notável: é o menor número inteiro que pode ser representado de duas maneiras pela soma de dois cubos: 1729=1^3+12^3=9^3+10^3.</p>

<p>Em 1882, o primeiro fio de luzes eléctricas a decorar uma árvore de Natal foi criado para a sua casa por Edward H. Johnson, um associado de Thomas Edison. Anteriormente, as árvores tinham sido decoradas com velas de cera. A edição de Dezembro de 1901 do Ladies' Home Journal anunciava as lâmpadas da árvore de Natal, feitas pela primeira vez comercialmente pela Edison General Electric Co. of Harrison, N.J. em cordas de nove tomadas, cada uma com uma miniatura de 2 velas, 32 volts, lâmpada de filamento de carbono*. As luzes das árvores de Natal rapidamente se tornaram a fúria entre os americanos ricos, mas o cidadão médio só as utilizou nos anos 20 ou mais tarde. As lâmpadas de caracteres tornaram-se populares nos anos 20, as lâmpadas de bolhas nos anos 40, as lâmpadas cintilantes nos anos 50 e as lâmpadas de plástico em 1955.</p>

<p><em>"STMicroelectronics’ STNRG011A digital power combination controller for 90W to 300W power supplies features enhanced overload management that ensures accurate output-voltage regulation when overcurrent protection is active. Integrating a power-factor correction (PFC) controller, LLC resonant half-bridge controller, 800V startup circuitry, and supervisory engine, the STNRG011A is used in power adapters, chargers, and television and lighting power supplies. The multi-mode PFC controller implements performance-enhancing features including input-voltage feedforward, a distortion optimizer, and frequency limitation. The digital supervisory engine features an 8-bit core and dedicated peripherals, with digital algorithms stored in internal ROM to ensure reliability and a minimal bill of materials (BoM). Compared to the existing STNRG011, the STNRG011A with its new overload-management algorithm increases the switching frequency when overcurrent protection is triggered. In addition to maintaining output-voltage regulation, this also prevents unwanted shutdown of the power supply."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4489.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The mission has concluded that the solar-powered lander has run out of energy after more than four years on the Red Planet. NASA’s InSight mission has ended after more than four years of collecting unique science on Mars. Mission controllers at the agency’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California were unable to contact the lander after two consecutive attempts, leading them to conclude the spacecraft’s solar-powered batteries have run out of energy – a state engineers refer to as “dead bus.” NASA had previously decided to declare the mission over if the lander missed two communication attempts. The agency will continue to listen for a signal from the lander, just in case, but hearing from it at this point is considered unlikely. The last time InSight communicated with Earth was Dec. 15. “I watched the launch and landing of this mission, and while saying goodbye to a spacecraft is always sad, the fascinating science InSight conducted is cause for celebration,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasa-retires-insight-mars-lander-mission-after-years-of-science">[...]</a>

The medium-lift Vega C lifted off from Europe's Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana on Tuesday (Dec. 20) at 8:47 p.m. EST (10:47 p.m. local time; 0147 GMT on Dec. 21), carrying two satellites for Airbus' Pléiades Neo Earth-imaging constellation. The rocket's first stage, known as the P120C, did its job. But the second stage, called the Zefiro 40, did not. "Approximately 2 minutes and 27 seconds after liftoff an anomaly occurred on the Zefiro 40, thus ending the Vega C mission," representatives of Arianespace, the French company that operates the Vega C, said in an emailed statement on Tuesday night."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/arianespace-vega-c-launch-failure-december-2022">[...]</a>

The discovery comes from a study led by researchers at The University of Texas at Austin, where researchers developed a computer model to observe what happens after a comet or asteroid strikes the ice shell, which is estimated to be tens of kilometers thick. The model shows that if an impact can make it at least halfway through the moon’s ice shell, the heated meltwater it generates will sink through the rest of the ice, bringing oxidants — a class of chemicals required for life — from the surface to the ocean, where they could help sustain any potential life in the sheltered waters. The researchers compared the steady sinking of the massive melt chamber to a foundering ship. “Once you get enough water, you’re just going to sink,” said lead author and doctoral student Evan Carnahan. “It’s like the Titanic times 10.” Scientists have proposed impacts as a means to transport oxidants on Europa, but they assumed the strikes would have to break through the ice."</em> <a href="https://news.utexas.edu/2022/12/15/comet-impacts-could-bring-ingredients-for-life-to-europas-ocean/">[...]</a>

The AD9833 (and boards that contain it, such as the GY-9833) is a great little signal generator. But using one means one needs a couple of libraries from among many possible choices; many user interface decisions; some pushbutton magic; and some construction if the device is to be actually useful. Having looked around and found many previous project options, I decided that too much choice is confusing, and most of those options had some imperfections or bugs that I would consider showstoppers. So I put together my own, using an Arduino Nano and a few simple libraries that are included with the IDE, and a bunch of code and some construction - and described it in a manual.

The result is a quirky musical toy, surprisingly expressive and with a personality of its own. The input part of the instrument is a 5×5 matrix of tactile push buttons, each one paired with a diode to prevent ghosting (ghosting as in false input. Diodes won’t solve unrequited love issues.) Some of the pins used as key inputs are shared with the LED matrix, requiring to continuously switch the display off and back on, which results in a noticeable flicker."</em> <a href="https://turiscandurra.com/2022/04/ts-det1-microbit-keypad-synth-with-detuning/">[...]</a>

That project functioned similarly to this one."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Turntable-Rotating-Platform/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2AMW">Lisp Star</a></h2>

<p><em>"The Lisp Star is a star-shaped pendant that you can program in Lisp to make its six coloured LEDs twinkle in different patterns The pendant is based on the ATtiny3227, a microcontroller with 32Kbytes of flash memory and 3Kbytes of RAM, enough memory to run an integer version of my Lisp interpreter, uLisp. To program it you connect to it from a computer via the six pads on the front of the pendant, and you can then enter a program written in uLisp, or edit an existing program, via a serial terminal or the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE. I must admit that my original motivation for designing this was the incongruity of an item of jewellery running a high-level programming language. But it has a more serious application: many non-technical people who would like to learn about programming are not particularly motivated by "Hello World" programs, or programs that perform mathematical calculations, but they might be inspired by the idea of designing their own pattern of flashing LEDs on a pendant. It's powered by a 3V coin cell on the back. Press the push button to run the Lisp program and start the pendant twinkling, and press it again to turn it off."</em> <a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2AMW">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.instructables.com/Midbar-V20/">Midbar V2.0</a></h2>

<p><em>"With the development of cryptanalysis and new hacking techniques, the cost of accessing your data without your authorization continues to decline, making it easier and more attractive for different sides to get it. I'm not going to get into details about the motivation of each side and the goals they're trying to achieve by obtaining your data. Instead, I would like to focus on the solution to that problem. In my opinion, the only way to keep your data private is to raise the costs of unauthorized access to it as high as possible, ideally higher than any reward that a third side can get by obtaining your data. Doing so puts away the incentives to access your data without your permission. To raise the cost of unauthorized access to your data - I've developed Midbar (which later on "evolved" into a multi-user Cipherbox, and now it kinda turned back into Midbar because I realized that a "multi-user Midbar" is superfluous and not as stable as a single-user one)."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Midbar-V20/">[...]</a>
