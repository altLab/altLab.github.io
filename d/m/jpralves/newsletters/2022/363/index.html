<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1629, o físico e astrónomo holandês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens">Christiaan Huygens</a>. Ele  fundou a teoria das ondas da luz, descobriu a verdadeira forma dos anéis de Saturno, e contribuiu para a ciência da dinâmica - o estudo da acção das forças sobre os corpos. Usando uma lente que ele mesmo moeu, a 25 de Março de 1655, descobriu a primeira lua de Saturno, mais tarde denominada Titã. Em 1656, patenteou o primeiro relógio pendular, que desenvolveu para permitir a medição exacta do tempo enquanto observava os céus. Cristiaan Huygens estudou a relação do comprimento de um pêndulo com o seu período de oscilação (1673) e declarou teorias sobre a força centrífuga em movimento circular que influenciaram Sir Isaac Newton na formulação da sua Lei da Gravidade. Huygens também estudou e desenhou os primeiros mapas de Marte. A 14 de Janeiro de 2005, uma sonda espacial da NASA, com o nome de Huygens, aterrou em Titan.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1898, o Engenheiro electrotécnico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Stephen_Black">Harold Stephen Black</a>. Ele descobriu e desenvolveu o princípio do feedback negativo, no qual a saída de amplificação é introduzida de novo na entrada, produzindo assim uma amplificação quase sem distorções e constante. Em 1921, Black juntou-se ao precursor dos Laboratórios Bell, na cidade de Nova Iorque, trabalhando na eliminação da distorção. Depois de seis anos de persistência, Black concebeu o seu amplificador de feedback negativo num deslocamento pendular para trabalhar a bordo do ferry. Basicamente, o conceito envolvia a saída dos sistemas de alimentação para a entrada como um método de controlo do sistema. O princípio encontrou aplicações generalizadas na electrónica, incluindo electrónica industrial, militar, e de consumo, armamento, computadores analógicos, e dispositivos biomecânicos tais como pacemakers.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1927, o químico neozelandês-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_MacDiarmid">Alan G. MacDiarmid</a>. Ele partilhou o Prémio Nobel da Química de 2000 (com Alan Heeger e Hideki Shirakawa) "para a descoberta e desenvolvimento de polímeros condutores". Os plásticos (formados de unidades repetidas em moléculas de polímeros de cadeia longa) na maioria das vezes não conduzem electricidade, e são utilizados para isolamento. No final dos anos 70, estes cientistas conceberam materiais de polímeros que eram semi-condutores, capazes de conduzir electricidade. As aplicações práticas incluem agora polímeros condutores em janelas "inteligentes" capazes de excluir a luz solar, díodos emissores de luz, células solares e ecrãs para telemóveis e pequenos ecrãs de televisão. A investigação tem sido estimulada para tentar produzir transístores constituídos por moléculas individuais com as quais se pode reduzir drasticamente o tamanho dos computadores.</p>

<p>Em 1611, a palavra "telescópio" foi utilizada pela primeira vez em público pelo Príncipe Federico Cesi num banquete realizado pela sociedade científica pioneira, a Academia de Linceanos (ou Luchs, da qual foi fundador). Foi realizada para homenagear Galileu, numa grande propriedade na encosta de uma colina. Depois de Galileu ter mostrado aos convidados os satélites de Júpiter, outras maravilhas celestiais, e até uma inscrição num edifício a três milhas de distância. Embora o nome tenha sido anunciado por Cesi para baptizar o instrumento de Galileu, a palavra telescópio (em italiano) foi talvez concebida por um poeta-teólogo grego, que por acaso estava presente, a partir de palavras gregas* (tele = longínquo e scopeo = ver).</p>

<p>Em 1932, o átomo foi dividido por um feixe de prótons sobre um alvo de lítio. Dois físicos, o inglês Sir John Douglas Cockcroft e o irlandês Errnest Walton tinham desenvolvido o primeiro acelerador de partículas nucleares (o gerador Cockcroft-Walton, pelo qual partilharam o Prémio Nobel da Física de 1951. O acelerador foi construído numa sala em desuso no Laboratório Cavendish. Com este equipamento, Walton conseguiu ser o primeiro a dividir o átomo (o seu núcleo). Quando um protão do feixe fornecido pelo acelerador atingiu um núcleo de lítio, a sua combinação instável desintegrou-se em duas partículas alfa (núcleos de hélio). Walton observou as cintilações características das partículas alfa numa tela de sulfureto de zinco.</p>

<p>E nesta semana que passou foi lançada a primeira missão tripulada totalmente privada para a estação espacial internacional. Um foguetão SpaceX Falcon 9 lançou o Ax-1, uma missão da empresa Axiom Space, com sede em Houston, no dia 8 de Abril às 11:17 EDT (1517 GMT) do Centro Espacial Kennedy da NASA, na Costa Espacial da Florida. Nenhum dos quatro tripulantes do Ax-1 é um passageiro espacial do governo. Michael López-Alegría (comandante da missão e ex-astronauta da NASA), Eytan Stibbe (ex-piloto da aviação israelita), Larry Connor (investidor e piloto particular norte-americano) e Mark Pathy (empresário canadiano) vão estar na EEI durante nove dias a fazer experiências científicas e actividades de cariz educativo e comercial.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker e alguns vídeos interessantes.</p>

<p><em>"With help from a cryocooler, the Mid-Infrared Instrument has dropped down to just a few degrees above the lowest temperature matter can reach and is ready for calibration. NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope will see the first galaxies to form after the big bang, but to do that its instruments first need to get cold – really cold. On April 7, Webb’s Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) – a joint development by NASA and ESA (European Space Agency) – reached its final operating temperature below 7 kelvins (minus 447 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 266 degrees Celsius). Along with Webb’s three other instruments, MIRI initially cooled off in the shade of Webb’s tennis-court-size sunshield, dropping to about 90 kelvins (minus 298 F, or minus 183 C). But dropping to less than 7 kelvins required an electrically powered cryocooler. Last week, the team passed a particularly challenging milestone called the “pinch point,” when the instrument goes from 15 kelvins (minus 433 F, or minus 258 C) to 6.4 kelvins (minus 448 F, or minus 267 C)."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/webb-telescopes-coldest-instrument-reaches-operating-temperature">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4438.html">STMicroelectronics’ integrated automotive audio amplifier combines high-definition sound with class-G efficiency</a></h2>

<p><em>"STMicroelectronics’ TDA7901 automotive amplifier integrates a buck controller for class-G power switching and supports high-definition audio, a market-unique combination for great listening and high efficiency. In class-G operation, the TDA7901 buck controller automatically optimizes the voltage supplied to the bridge-tied load (BTL) power stage depending on the audio-signal level. The resulting smooth, analog sound comes with near-class-D efficiency at normal listening levels. Because the power dissipation is much lower compared with a conventional class-A/B amplifier, the heatsink requirement is optimized. Integrating the buck controller in the IC contributes to reducing system size and weight. It also cuts the bill of materials, simplifies circuit design, and saves developing firmware to control the voltage rail."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4438.html">[...]</a>

Quantum systems can interact with one another and with their surroundings in ways that are fundamentally different from those of their classical counterparts. In a quantum sensor, the particularities of these interactions are exploited to obtain characteristic information about the environment of the quantum system, for instance the strength of a magnetic and electric field in which it is immersed. Crucially, when such a device suitably harnesses the laws of quantum mechanics, then its sensitivity can surpass what is possible, even in principle, with conventional, classical technologies. Unfortunately, quantum sensors are exquisitely sensitive not only to the physical quantities of interest, but also to noise."</em> <a href="https://www.phys.ethz.ch/news-and-events/d-phys-news/2022/04/the-side-effects-of-quantum-error-correction-and-how-to-cope-with-them.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Seventy years ago this spring, the first fully electronic computer at what is today Los Alamos National Laboratory came online. Called the MANIAC, it was constructed when electronic computing and its associated industry were still in their infancy. Early computer centers like Los Alamos had to build their own systems and invent the methods for using them. This pioneering effort gave Los Alamos and the few places like it an outsized influence on the emerging electronic computing field, shaping the computing technologies and methods we experience today. One of the first electronic computers in the world, the MANIAC represented a substantial human investment at Los Alamos to develop the computing methods and tools capable of serving the Lab’s complex problems in weapons science. This meant that people with a variety of backgrounds and skill sets had to invent concepts and practices that are commonplace today, but were new and profound in their implications in the 1950s."</em> <a href="https://discover.lanl.gov/news/0412-maniac">[...]</a>

<p><em>"An international team, co-led by researchers at The University of Manchester’s National Graphene Institute (NGI) in the U.K. and the Penn State College of Engineering in the U.S., has developed a tunable graphene-based platform that allows for fine control over the interaction between light and matter in the terahertz (THz) spectrum to reveal rare phenomena known as exceptional points. The team published their results today (April 8) in Science. The work could advance optoelectronic technologies to better generate, control and sense light and potentially impact wireless communications, according to the researchers. They demonstrated a way to control THz waves, which exist at frequencies between those of microwaves and infrared waves. The feat could contribute to the development of beyond-5G wireless technology for high-speed communication networks. Weak and strong interactions Light and matter can couple, interacting at different levels: weakly -- where they might be correlated but do not change each other’s constituents -- or strongly -- where their interactions can fundamentally change the system."</em> <a href="https://www.psu.edu/news/engineering/story/researchers-engineer-electrically-tunable-graphene-device-study-rare-physics/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2022/04/first-integrated-laser-lithium-niobate-chip">First integrated laser on lithium niobate chip</a></h2>

<p><em>"Research paves the way for high-powered telecommunication systems For all the recent advances in integrated lithium niobate photonic circuits — from frequency combs to frequency converters and modulators — one big component has remained frustratingly difficult to integrate: lasers. Long haul telecommunication networks, data center optical interconnects, and microwave photonic systems all rely on lasers to generate an optical carrier used in data transmission. In most cases, lasers are stand-alone devices, external to the modulators, making the whole system more expensive and less stable and scalable. Now, researchers from the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) in collaboration with industry partners at Freedom Photonics and HyperLight Corporation, have developed the first fully integrated high-power laser on a lithium niobate chip, paving the way for high-powered telecommunication systems, fully integrated spectrometers, optical remote sensing, and efficient frequency conversion for quantum networks, among other applications. “Integrated lithium niobate photonics is a promising platform for the development of high-performance chip-scale optical systems, but getting a laser onto a lithium niobate chip has proved to be one of the biggest design challenges,” said Marko Loncar, the Tiantsai Lin Professor of Electrical Engineering and Applied Physics at SEAS and senior author of the study. “In this research, we used all the nano-fabrication tricks and techniques learned from previous developments in integrated lithium niobate photonics to overcome those challenges and achieve the goal of integrating a high-powered laser on a thin-film lithium niobate platform.” The research is published in the journal Optica."</em> <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2022/04/first-integrated-laser-lithium-niobate-chip">[...]</a>

The same silicon die is used for three different integrated circuits, using tiny internal fuses to change its functionality.

<h2><a href="https://www.instructables.com/Servo-Wordclock-V2/">Servo Wordclock V2</a></h2>

<p><em>"3 years ago we finished building a word clock controlled by 114 servos. In this variation of the popular clock, letters are projected from the back onto a screen. Each letter is connected to a linear actuator that can be moved back and forth by a servo so that the projection changes size and focus onto the screen. Since we got a lot of positive feedback for our clock we started to work on an improved version. Version 1 of the clock looked great but the building process was very tedious and would make it almost impossible for other people to recreate. In this project, we did a complete redesign of the clock with the goal to make it more reliable and greatly ease the assembly process."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Servo-Wordclock-V2/">[...]</a>
