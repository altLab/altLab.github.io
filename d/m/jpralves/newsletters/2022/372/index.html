<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1801, o matemático e físico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Pl%C3%BCcker">Julius Plücker</a>. Ele ficou conhecido pelo trabalho que sugeria o princípio de grande alcance da dualidade, que afirma a equivalência de certos tipos de teoremas relacionados. Ele descobriu também que os raios catódicos (raios de electrões produzidos no vácuo) são desviados do seu caminho por um campo magnético, um princípio vital para o desenvolvimento de dispositivos electrónicos modernos, tais como a televisão. No início sozinho e mais tarde com o físico alemão Johann W. Hittorf, Plücker fez muitas descobertas importantes na espectroscopia. Antes de Bunsen e Kirchhoff, ele anunciou que as linhas espectrais eram características de cada substância química e que isto tinha valor para a análise química. Em 1862, Plücker assinalou que o mesmo elemento pode exibir espectros diferentes a temperaturas diferentes.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1806, o médico, químico e inventor inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Davy">Edward Davy</a>. Ele inventou um repetidor electromagnético para retransmissão de sinais telegráficos (1836) e um telégrafo electroquímico (1838). Voltou o seu interesse para a telegrafia após ter estudado medicina e iniciado uma carreira como químico.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1888, o matemático russo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Friedmann">Alexander Friedmann</a>. Ele foi o primeiro a elaborar uma análise matemática de um universo em expansão consistente com a relatividade geral, mas sem a constante cosmológica de Einstein. Em 1922, ele desenvolveu soluções para as equações de campo, uma das quais descreveu claramente um universo que começou a partir de um ponto singular, e se expandiu posteriormente. No seu artigo On the Curvature of Space recebido pela revista Zeitschrift für Physik em 29 de Junho de 1922, mostrou que o raio de curvatura do universo pode ser ou uma função crescente ou periódica do tempo. Em Julho de 1925, fez uma subida de balão de 7400 m para fazer observações meteorológicas e médicas.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1897, o químico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Wittig">Georg Wittig</a>. Ele foi responsável pelos estudos de compostos orgânicos de fósforo lhe valeram uma parte (com Herbert C. Brown) do Prémio Nobel da Química em 1979. Em 1953, ele descobriu como uma família de compostos orgânicos chamados ylides poderia formar a base da reacção Wittig, que fácil e previsivelmente une dois átomos de carbono de moléculas diferentes para formar uma dupla ligação. A fiabilidade da reacção Wittig permitiu a outros químicos prosseguir e publicar descobertas sobre milhares de aplicações para ligar grandes moléculas de carbono. O processo foi utilizado para sintetizar compostos complexos tais como vitamina A, derivados de vitamina D, esteróides, e pesticidas biológicos. Devido à reacção Wittig, tais compostos podem agora ser sintetizados rotineiramente.</p>

<p>Em 1963 é lançada a bordo da Vostok 6, a cosmonauta soviética Valentina Tereshkova, que se tornaria a primeira mulher a viajar para o espaço. Após 48 órbitas e 71 horas, ela voltou à Terra a 19 de Junho, a Vostok 6 reentrou na atmosfera, e Tereshkova saltou de pára-quedas com sucesso para a terra após ter ejectado a 20.000 pés.</p>

<p><em>" Nexperia, the expert in essential semiconductors, today announced two Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) protection devices optimized for use with retimers and redrivers on high-speed data lines. PESD2V8Y1BSF is designed to protect USB4 (Thunderbolt) interfaces while PESD4V0Y1BCSF is intended for use with both USB4 as well as HDMI 2.1. These products use Nexperia’s proven TrEOS technology, which combines low clamping with low capacitance and high robustness. Retimers and redrivers are commonly used in the design of high-speed USB4 interfaces. However, these result in shorter board traces which have a lower parasitic inductance, an unintended consequence of which is a reduction in the overall system-level ESD robustness. The PESD2V8Y1BSF and PESD4V0Y1BCSF provide low very fast Transmission Line Pulse (vfTLP) peak clamping voltages, which are even lower than USB4 protection solutions without visible trigger voltage in the standard I(V) TLP curve."</em> <a href="https://www.nexperia.com/about/news-events/press-releases/USB4-ESD-devices-from-Nexperia-provide-optimum-balance-of-protection-and-performance-.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Toshiba Electronic Devices &amp; Storage Corporation and Toshiba Corporation (collectively “Toshiba”) have together developed the world’s first[1] 4.5-kV double-gate reverse-conducting injection-enhanced gate transistor (RC-IEGT[2][3]). Toshiba confirmed a total power loss, when switching on and off (switching loss), reduction of 24%[4] compared with the conventional single-gate structure. Power devices, components that supply and manage power, are essential to reduce power consumption in all kinds of electronic equipment and to achieve a carbon neutral society. In the global trend to decarbonization and energy saving, IEGTs are used in a wide range of applications, such as high power inverters and high-voltage DC power transmission, where they are required to have higher current and efficiency, and lower power losses and consumption. It is difficult to reduce power loss in IEGT, as there is a trade-off whereby reducing the loss when the IEGT is on (conduction loss) increases switching loss. Toshiba developed a 4.5-kV double-gate RC-IEGT with a hole control gate (CG) separate from the main gate (MG)."</em> <a href="https://toshiba.semicon-storage.com/ap-en/company/news/news-topics/2022/06/igbt-iegt-20220615-1.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/about/news-releases/products/industrys-largest-family-of-inductive-position-sensors">Industry’s Largest Family of Inductive Position Sensors Now Includes Solution for ISO 26262-Compliant EV Motor Control Applications</a></h2>

<p><em>"Developers of motor control systems are rapidly replacing Hall Effect position sensors and older magnetic resolver solutions with inductive alternatives that eliminate expensive magnets and other heavy transformer-based structures so they can be integrated onto simple, compact printed circuit boards (PCBs). Extending the world’s broadest line of inductive position sensors into the EV motor control market, Microchip Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP) announces the LX34070 IC that has been purpose-built for EV motor control applications. It includes differential outputs, fast sample rates and features that make it functional-safety-ready for ISO 26262 compliance in the Automotive Safety Integrity Level–C (ASIL–C) classification. “The LX34070 inductive position sensor enables lighter, smaller, more reliable motor control solutions that meet stringent safety requirements, reduce overall system costs, and can operate seamlessly and precisely in the noisy environment of an automobile’s DC motors, high currents and solenoids,” said Fanie Duvenhage, vice president of Microchip’s mixed signal and linear analog business unit. “Designers can use the LX34070 to further streamline EV motor control designs by pairing it with other functional-safety-ready Microchip devices including our 8-bit AVR® and PIC® microcontrollers, our 32-bit microcontrollers, and our dsPIC® digital signal controllers.” The LX34070 inductive position sensor solution offers numerous advantages compared to magnetic resolvers and Linear Voltage Differential Transducers (LVDTs), at a fraction of the cost. By using PCB traces rather than transformer-based magnetic windings and coil structures, the LX34070 device has negligible size and mass compared to alternatives that weigh as much as a pound."</em> <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/about/news-releases/products/industrys-largest-family-of-inductive-position-sensors">[...]</a>

<p><em>"STMicroelectronics (NYSE: STM), a global semiconductor leader serving customers across the spectrum of electronics applications, has introduced new inertial sensors that contain the intelligent sensor processing unit (ISPU) to power the onlife era: interacting with trained devices with intelligence moving from “on” the edge to “in” the edge. The ISM330ISN always-on 6-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU) for movement and position sensing uses its embedded intelligence to deliver unrivaled performance and accuracy for its size and power. Ideal for IoT and industrial applications, ST’s new IMU sets to accelerate response time and extend battery life in equipment such as condition monitors for predictive maintenance, as well as battery-operated asset trackers and industrial applications such as robots. The intelligence built into the ISM330ISN enables smart devices to perform advanced motion-detection functions in the sensor without interaction with the external microcontroller (MCU), thus saving power at system level. ST’s approach integrates a specialized processor, the ISPU, in a small area directly on the sensor chip, optimized for machine-learning applications. This enables the ISM330ISN module to have a 50% smaller footprint and consume 50% less power than a typical co-packaged MCU."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/p4460.html">[...]</a>

From autonomous drones and self-driving cars to medical imaging and product manufacturing, many computer applications and robots use visual information to make critical decisions. Cities increasingly rely on these automated technologies for public safety and infrastructure maintenance. However, compared to humans, computers see with a kind of tunnel vision that leaves them vulnerable to attacks with potentially catastrophic results. For example, a human driver, seeing graffiti covering a stop sign, will still recognize it and stop the car at an intersection.

Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), in collaboration with colleagues at the University of Cambridge, have developed a new method to dramatically extend the lifetime of organic aqueous flow batteries, improving the commercial viability of a technology that has the potential to safely and inexpensively store energy from renewable sources such as wind and solar. “Organic aqueous redox flow batteries promise to significantly lower the costs of electricity storage from intermittent energy sources, but the instability of the organic molecules has hindered their commercialization,” said Michael Aziz, the Gene and Tracy Sykes Professor of Materials and Energy Technologies at SEAS. “Now, we have a truly practical solution to extend the lifetime of these molecules, which is an enormous step to making these batteries competitive.” The research is published in Nature Chemistry. Over the past decade, Aziz and Roy Gordon, the Thomas Dudley Cabot Professor of Chemistry and Professor of Materials Science, have collaborated to develop organic aqueous flow batteries using molecules known as anthraquinones, which are composed of naturally abundant elements such as carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, to store and release energy. Over the course of their research, the team discovered that these anthraquinones decompose slowly over time, regardless of how many times the battery has been used.

Yet despite the chip's potency, there’s been no shortage of vulnerability grievances, as fears of sensitive data and personal information leaks abound. More recently, the chip was found to have a security flaw that was quickly deemed harmless. The M1 chip uses a feature called pointer authentication, which acts as a last line of defense against typical software vulnerabilities.

<p><em>"Just 33 light-years from Earth, the system appears to host two rocky, Earth-sized planets. Astronomers at MIT and elsewhere have discovered a new multiplanet system within our galactic neighborhood that lies just 10 parsecs, or about 33 light-years, from Earth, making it one of the closest known multiplanet systems to our own. At the heart of the system lies a small and cool M-dwarf star, named HD 260655, and astronomers have found that it hosts at least two terrestrial, Earth-sized planets. The rocky worlds are likely not habitable, as their orbits are relatively tight, exposing the planets to temperatures that are too high to sustain liquid surface water. Nevertheless, scientists are excited about this system because the proximity and brightness of its star will give them a closer look at the properties of the planets and signs of any atmosphere they might hold. “Both planets in this system are each considered among the best targets for atmospheric study because of the brightness of their star,” says Michelle Kunimoto, a postdoc in MIT’s Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research and one of the discovery’s lead scientists."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/multiplanet-system-nearby-0615">[...]</a>

Similarly, different polarisations of light do not interact with each other either. Each polarisation can be used as an independent information channel, enabling more information to be stored in multiple channels, hugely enhancing information density.

<h2><a href="https://www.figlab.com/research/2022/electripop">ElectriPop: Low-Cost, Shape-Changing Displays Using Electrostatically Inflated Mylar Sheets</a></h2>

<p><em>"Shape-changing displays offer a uniquely embodied and highly aesthetic mode of computer-human communication, perfect for uses such as ambient displays, embodied avatars, interactive art, and educational experiences. By giving elements form, these applications can become more engaging with increased physicality. However, practical shape-changing displays continue to be elusive, and there is considerable ongoing research in this area, both in the HCI community and beyond. Ideal approaches might be considered to have the following properties: low-cost, fast-actuating, silent-operation, compact, robust, and easy to fabricate. In this work, we describe ElectriPop, a new fabrication workflow and computational tool that allows sheets of metalized mylar to be cut and then “inflated” into complex 3D forms using electrostatic charge. This is achieved by carefully placing and nesting various cuts, slits, and holes such that mylar elements repel from one another."</em> <a href="https://www.figlab.com/research/2022/electripop">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Tuning a quantum computer’s measurement rate provides hints of quantum phase transition. Researchers at Duke University and the University of Maryland have used the frequency of measurements on a quantum computer to get a glimpse into the quantum phenomena of phase changes – something analogous to water turning to steam. By measuring the number of operations that can be implemented on a quantum computing system without triggering the collapse of its quantum state, the researchers gained insight into how other systems — both natural and computational — meet their tipping points between phases. The results also provide guidance for computer scientists working to implement quantum error correction that will eventually enable quantum computers to achieve their full potential. The results appeared online June 3 in the journal Nature Physics. When heating water to a boil, the movement of molecules evolves as the temperature changes until it hits a critical point when it starts to turn to steam."</em> <a href="https://pratt.duke.edu/about/news/glimpses-quantum-computing-phase-changes-show-researchers-tipping-point">[...]</a>

<p><em>"It took a major redesign for cheap flexible chips to reach their promise. For decades, hopeful techies have been promising a world where absolutely every object you encounter—bandages, bottles, bananas—will have some kind of smarts thanks to supercheap programmable plastic processors. If you’ve been wondering why that hasn’t happened yet, it’s that nobody has built working processors that can be made in the billions for less than a penny each. It hasn’t been for want of trying; in 2021 Arm reproduced its simplest 32-bit microcontroller, the M0, in plastic, but even this couldn’t hope to meet the mark. The problem, according to engineers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and at British flexible-electronics manufacture PragmatIC Semiconductor, is that even the simplest industry-standard microcontrollers are too complex to make on plastic in bulk. In research to be presented at the International Symposium on Computer Architecture later this month, the transatlantic team presents a simple yet fully functional plastic processor that could be made at sub-penny prices."</em> <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/plastic-microprocessor">[...]</a>

<p><em>"PROJECT ABSTRACT : Now we as humans have always been intrigued by non living stuff moving around. Starting with throwing stones around we have now come at a point where we make those planes around the sky. On their own too. It helps us a lot when we are able to get to places wherein we can’t by ourselves. Firstly it compensates for our laziness and then it eliminates all the physical constraints that we might encounter. So it is always in need to bring automation in our lives to make daily stuff easy and admittingly fun to do."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/IOT-Based-Smart-Security-Surveillance-Robot/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Turn an old circuit board into a digital clock. The clock is in binary with 4 bits of LEDs for hours and 6 bits of LEDs for minutes. The clock includes two LEDs for a seconds blinker. The clock also includes audio with Star Trek sound clips that play at certain times. The clock is driven by an Arduino Nano that also drives a DF Player Mini connected with an 8 ohm speaker for playing the audio. The clock also has two buttons, one for setting the hours and one for setting the minutes."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Themed-Binary-Digital-Clock-With-Arduino-Nano-and-/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"These are all the files that I used to make a ATtiny85 circuit that controls a motor's speed using a potentiometer, and also has indicator LEDs to qualitatively show the speed as you turn the potentiometer. One thing to note is that for some reason the footprint for the diode D1 is backwards in KiCAD so when I first tried building this circuit the transistor would get very hot and after reversing the diode, the circuit worked properly.

<p><em>"Where I live, from spring to autumn we have to compete for territory against tiger mosquito. Local stores offer a impressive list of anti mosquito devices, candles, including sophisticated traps sold a few hundred euros, I even found one sold 2000 - this give you an idea of how desperate people are to get rid of those invaders. One of my favorite weapon to fight against mosquito is this cheap electric swatter, but to make this fight even more rewarding I thought I should upgrade my weapon. In this instructable, I will show and explain how to hack an electric swatter to : - add electronic to detect kills. - add a 4 digit counter. - make it usb rechargeable."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Ultimate-Mosquito-Swatter-Mod-for-Gamer-Add-Kill-C/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Solar-powered creature that reacts to energy with animations on a 7-segment LCD. It can also blink! Klara is a solar-powered creature with a simple, unlit 7-segment LCD display and an ATTiny85 microcontroller. It stores her energy in a pair of 1F supercapacitors so she can stay awake for a few more hours after sundown. When the sun shines and her reserves are full, she plays lively animations on her LCD display. As her energy declines, the animations slow down and freeze into still images, until they disappear altogether."</em> <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/185825-klara-a-solar-lcd-creature">[...]</a>
