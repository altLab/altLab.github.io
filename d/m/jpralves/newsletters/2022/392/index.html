<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1749, o químico e fotógrafo escocês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Rutherford">Daniel Rutherford</a>. Ele descobriu a porção de ar que não suporta a combustão, agora conhecida por ser nitrogénio. Depois de deixar um rato viver numa quantidade confinada de ar até morrer, queimou uma vela e queimou fósforo no mesmo ar, desde que ardessem. Assumiu que o gás restante era dióxido de carbono, que dissolveu passando-o através de um álcali forte. No entanto, permaneceu gás incapaz de suportar a respiração ou combustão, que ele sabia já não conter oxigénio ou dióxido de carbono. Chamou-lhe "ar sofisticado", seguindo a teoria do phlogiston de Georg Stahl. Foi mais tarde devidamente descrito por Antoine Lavoisier. Rutherford também concebeu o primeiro termómetro máximo-mínimo.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1962, o programador de computador norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Katz">Phil Katz</a>. Ele ficou conhecido como o criador do formato de ficheiro Zip para compressão de dados, e o autor de PKZIP, um programa para a criação de ficheiros zip que corria sob DOS. Um processo de direitos de autor entre System Enhancement Associates (SEA) e a empresa de Katz, PKWARE, Inc., foi amplamente divulgado na comunidade BBS no final da década de 1980. O negócio de software de Phil Katz foi muito bem sucedido, mas ele lutou contra o isolamento social e o alcoolismo crónico nos últimos anos da sua vida.</p>

<p>Em 1957, foi lançado o Sputnik 2, com o primeiro animal vivo enviado para o espaço - um cão husky siberiano, Laika ("ladrão" em russo). Pela sua concepção, a embarcação não foi planeada para recuperação, e Laika morreu em órbita. Dados biológicos, os primeiros dados do seu género, foram transmitidos de volta à Terra enquanto ela viveu. Os dados mostraram aos cientistas como Laika se estava a adaptar ao espaço - informação importante para as iminentes missões tripuladas planeadas. O satélite de 508 kg permaneceu em órbita durante 162 dias. Laika foi considerada uma heroína na União Soviética.</p>

<p><em>"The day is approaching when NASA’s Mars InSight lander will fall silent, ending its history-making mission to reveal secrets of the Red Planet’s interior. The spacecraft’s power generation continues to decline as windblown dust on its solar panels thickens, so the team has taken steps to continue as long as possible with what power remains. The end is expected to come in the next few weeks. But even as the tightknit 25-to-30-member operations team – a small group compared to other Mars missions – continues to squeeze the most they can out of InSight (short for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport), they’ve also begun taking steps to wind down the mission. Here’s a glimpse of what that looks like. Preserving Data The most important of the final steps with the InSight mission is storing its trove of data and making it accessible to researchers around the world."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasa-prepares-to-say-farewell-to-insight-spacecraft">[...]</a>

The model assumes there are three kinds of neutrinos. Yet for more than two decades, a proposed fourth kind of neutrino has remained a promising explanation for anomalies seen in earlier physics experiments. Finding the theorized sterile neutrino would be a major discovery and radical shift in our understanding of the universe.

In the future, the new method will help identify the authenticity of pieces from the era of Russian avant-garde. Chemistry and ownership in one study Some of the common methods to identify a painting’s authenticity are ultraviolet luminescence, X-ray diffraction, infrared reflectography, and X-ray fluorescence. However, all of them allow specialists to analyze only a painting’s exterior, without looking into the molecular compounds of the paint used to create it. Researchers from ITMO’s have developed a semiquantative method based on infrared spectroscopy that can solve several tasks in just 30 seconds."</em> <a href="https://news.itmo.ru/en/science/photonics/news/12881/">[...]</a>

Scientists from MIT and elsewhere have used computer-vision models to identify and track turbulent structures that appear under the conditions needed to facilitate fusion reactions. Monitoring the formation and movements of these structures, called filaments or “blobs,” is important for understanding the heat and particle flows exiting from the reacting fuel, which ultimately determines the engineering requirements for the reactor walls to meet those flows.

Friction is an everyday phenomenon; it allows drivers to stop their cars by breaking and dancers to execute complicated moves on various floor surfaces. It can, however, also be an unwanted effect that drives the waste of large amounts of energy in industrial processes, the transportation sector, and elsewhere. Tribologists — those who study the science of interacting surfaces in relative motion — have estimated that one-quarter of global energy losses are due to friction and wear. While friction is extremely widespread and relevant in technology, the fundamental laws of friction are still obscure, and only recently have scientists been able to use advances in nanotechnology to understand, for example, the microscopic origin of da Vinci’s law, which holds that frictional forces are proportional to the applied load. Now, Riedo and her NYU Tandon postdoctoral researcher Martin Rejhon have found a new method to measure the interfacial shear between two atomic layers and discovered that this quantity is inversely related to friction, following a new law."</em> <a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/news/nyu-tandon-researchers-explore-more-frictionless-future">[...]</a>

In research published in Angewandte Chemie, first author Dr Gemeng Liang, Prof Zaiping Guo, A/Prof Wei Kong Pang and associates, used multiple capabilities at ANSTO and other techniques to provide evidence that doping a promising cathode material, spinel LiNi0.5 Mn1.5 O4 (LNMO), with germanium significantly strengthens the 4s-2p orbital interaction between oxygen and metal cations. “The 4s-2p orbital is relatively uncommon, but we found a compound in the literature in which germanium has a valence state of + 3, enabling an electron configuration ([Ar] 3d104s1) in which 4s transition metal orbital electrons are available to interact with unpaired electrons in the oxygen 2p orbital, producing the hybrid 4s-2p orbital, ”explained Dr Liang. The 4s-2p orbital creates structural stability in the LNMO material, as determined using synchrotron and neutron experiments at ANSTO’s Australian Synchrotron and the Australian Centre for Neutron Scattering, as well as other methods.

<p><em>"Unipolar quantum optoelectronic devices show potential for fast, long-range optical links that are also resistant to adverse weather conditions. Telecommunications have reshaped many aspects of our lives over the past few decades by providing incredibly convenient ways to share and access information. One of the most important enablers for this transformation has been the adoption and improvement of broadband technologies, which cram enormous amounts of data over wide frequency bands to achieve unprecedented transfer speeds. Today, most large cities have fiber optics-based networks that distribute high-speed internet directly to every home. Unfortunately, it is not always feasible to deploy fiber optic links to remote locations and rural areas, due to the associated costs and civil engineering work required. Such places could benefit from a different approach to optical broadband communications: free-space optics."</em> <a href="https://spie.org/news/higher-speeds-in-free-space-optical-communications-in-the-midinfrared-band?SSO=1">[...]</a>

Given that glass has numerous practical applications, knowing how this transition takes place is highly relevant. Researchers from the UAB Department of Physics and from the ICN2 explain how they studied the details of glass transition and observed how the restructuring of glass when turning into liquid is not always a homogeneous process, depending more on the temperature instead of the initial stability of the glass. Starting from the windows of our houses to communication via optical fiber, pharmaceuticals, the plastic industry or organic electronics, disorder is present in our lives. All these materials share a common characteristic, the lack of short-range order of the atoms and molecules that form the material, they are what we call glasses. This disorder has advantages such as transparency, better solubility, elasticity or homogeneity, depending on the material and the use you want to give it."</em> <a href="https://www.uab.cat/web/news-detail/new-advances-in-understanding-glass-to-liquid-transition-1345680342044.html?noticiaid=1345872782594">[...]</a>

<p><em>"On Earth, billions of subatomic particles called neutrinos pass through us every second, but we never notice because they rarely interact with matter. Because of this, neutrinos can travel straight paths over vast distances unimpeded, carrying information about their cosmic origins. Although most of these aptly named “ghost” particles detected on Earth originate from the Sun or our own atmosphere, some neutrinos come from the cosmos, far beyond our galaxy. These neutrinos, called astrophysical neutrinos, can provide valuable insight into some of the most powerful objects in the universe. For the first time, an international team of scientists has found evidence of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos emanating from the galaxy NGC 1068 in the constellation Cetus.

The properties of these nuclei are therefore of crucial importance not only in astrophysics, but also in relation to our everyday life. Our knowledge of light atomic nuclei has just been expanded thanks to accelerator studies conducted in Cracow on the specific excited states of carbon-13 nuclei. The precise observation of phenomena occurring in atomic nuclei, especially of high-energy states, is an extremely difficult task from both technical and theoretical aspects. However, there are varieties of high-lying excitations of atomic nuclei that, due to their specific structure, can be observed and interpreted with a high accuracy. A team of physicists from Poland, Italy, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Romania conducted a series of measurements of such states at Cyclotron Centre Bronowice in Cracow, where a beam of protons from the accelerator was collimated on carbon-13 targets."</em> <a href="https://press.ifj.edu.pl/en/news/2022/11/03/">[...]</a>

The research was published in the journal Angewandte Chemie. “Our goal was to create sustainable degradable polymeric structures,” Pentzer said. “We did this by leveraging the microstructures afforded by chemistry in conjunction with the macrostructures afforded by 3D printing.” Most commercial synthetic polymers consist of large molecules that do not break apart under normal conditions. When left in the environment, manufactured items such as foam cups or plastic containers break down into small pieces that are unseen by the naked eye, but the long polymer molecules remain present forever."</em> <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/news/2022/10/researchers-3d-print-degradable-polymers-using-salt.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"An open-source, low-cost, large-format 3D printer that can print directly from shredded plastic trash instead of filament The Trash Printer is an open-source large-format 3D printer that can print new and useful things directly out of shredded plastic trash. Polypropylene (#5) works best, but I've also printed with HDPE and LDPE (#2 and #4) Together, these common plastics make up over 50% of all household plastic waste! The parts aren't as detailed as typical 3D printed parts, but they're incredibly strong, light, and flexible; more comparable to parts made by injection molding than those made by most desktop printers. Skipping the filament-making step entirely reduces the recycling process to just two steps: Shred, and Print. Version 3 Overview: Estimated Build Time: 12 hours Estimated Cost: $1000-1500 or $3000-3500 with solar power Energy Cost: About 1 watt-hour per gram Print Area: V3: 22" x 14" x 22" V3 Mini: 8" x 16" x 22" The Trash Printer was inspired by the Precious Plastic movement, a global, open-source, small-scale plastic recycling movement! It started with 4 open-source machines - a shredder, an extruder, an injection molder, and a compression oven."</em> <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/185691-the-trash-printer-version-3">[...]</a>
