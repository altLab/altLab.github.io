<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1826, o inventor norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Ely_Beach">Alfred Ely Beach</a>. Ele ficou conhecido por ser o editor americano da revista Scientific American que noticiou os desenvolvimentos tecnológicos e patentes no século XIX. É ainda hoje publicada, uma das principais revistas científicas do mundo. O próprio Beach inventou um escudo de túnel e construiu o metro de tubo pneumático que impulsionava uma carruagem através da pressão de ar gerada por enormes ventiladores. O túnel era curto - um bloco - por isso funcionava como uma demonstração (1870-73), com uma estação e um vagão de comboio. Em 1856 ganhou o Primeiro Prémio e uma medalha de ouro na Exposição do Palácio de Cristal, em Nova Iorque. Beach tinha inventado uma máquina de escrever para cegos, parecida com a máquina de escrever moderna na disposição das suas chaves e barras de escrever, mas estampou as suas letras numa tira de papel estreita em vez de uma folha.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1858, o químico, físico e engenheiro austríaco <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Auer_von_Welsbach">Carl Auer von Welsbach</a>. Ele inventou o manto de gás que melhorou muito o brilho da luz que podia ser obtida a partir de lâmpadas a gás. Enquanto fazia testes de chama para examinar o espectro de certos compostos de terras raras, ele observou que as pequenas contas de material de teste num fio de platina se tornaram brancas e incandescentes. Teve então a ideia de mergulhar as teias de algodão com uma solução dos sais, depois queimar o algodão deixando uma matriz do composto. As suas experiências começaram com resultados ligeiramente promissores com óxido de lantânio, depois uma mistura com magnésia. Também experimentou óxidos de zircónio e outros antes de adicionar óxido de tório, o que tornou os mantos comercialmente viáveis. A sua invenção foi adoptada em todo o mundo onde quer que houvesse gás produzido, o que significava que tinha um negócio lucrativo a melhorar e a fabricá-los.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1877, o  físico e químico inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_William_Aston">Francis William Aston</a>. Ele recebeu o Prémio Nobel da Química de 1922 pelo seu desenvolvimento do espectrógrafo de massa, um dispositivo que separa átomos ou fragmentos moleculares de diferentes massas e mede essas massas com notável precisão. Em 1910 tornou-se assistente de Sir J.J. Thomson em Cambridge, que investigava os raios de carga positiva que emanavam das descargas gasosas. Aston inventou o seu espectrógrafo de massa (um novo tipo de aparelho de raios positivos) após a Primeira Guerra Mundial, com o qual mostrou que muitos elementos são misturas de isótopos. De facto, descobriu 212 dos 287 nuclídeos que ocorrem naturalmente. O espectrógrafo de massa é agora amplamente utilizado em geologia, química, biologia, e física nuclear.</p>

<p>Na manhã de 1 de Setembro de 1859, o astrónomo amador Richard Carrington ascendeu ao observatório privado ligado à sua propriedade rural nos arredores de Londres. Depois de ter aberto o obturador da cúpula para revelar o céu azul claro, apontou o seu telescópio de latão em direcção ao sol e começou a esboçar um aglomerado de enormes manchas escuras que lhe apareciam na superfície. De repente, Carrington viu o que descreveu como "duas manchas de luz intensamente brilhante e branca" que irrompiam das manchas solares. Cinco minutos mais tarde as bolas de fogo desapareceram, mas em poucas horas o seu impacto seria sentido em todo o globo. Nessa noite, as comunicações telegráficas em todo o mundo começaram a falhar; houve relatos de fagulhas de máquinas telegráficas, operadores chocantes e papéis de ajuste em chamas. Por todo o planeta, auroras coloridas iluminavam os céus nocturnos, brilhando tão intensamente que as aves começaram a chilrear e os trabalhadores começaram as suas tarefas diárias, acreditando que o sol tinha começado a nascer. Alguns pensavam que o fim do mundo estava próximo, mas os olhos nus de Carrington tinham descoberto a verdadeira causa dos acontecimentos bizarros: uma enorme erupção solar com a energia de 10 mil milhões de bombas atómicas. A chama lançou gás electrificado e partículas subatómicas em direcção à Terra, e a tempestade geomagnética resultante - apelidada de "Evento Carrington" - foi a maior de que há registo a ter atingido o planeta.</p>

<p><em>"A critical system aboard the probe was sending garbled data about its status. Engineers have fixed the issue but are still seeking the root cause. Engineers have repaired an issue affecting data from NASA’s Voyager 1 spacecraft. Earlier this year, the probe’s attitude articulation and control system (AACS), which keeps Voyager 1’s antenna pointed at Earth, began sending garbled information about its health and activities to mission controllers, despite operating normally. The rest of the probe also appeared healthy as it continued to gather and return science data. The team has since located the source of the garbled information: The AACS had started sending the telemetry data through an onboard computer known to have stopped working years ago, and the computer corrupted the information."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/engineers-solve-data-glitch-on-nasas-voyager-1">[...]</a>

<p><em>"New findings in microbes called cyanobacteria present new opportunities for plant science, bioengineering and environmental protection Michigan State University researchers and colleagues at the University of California Berkeley, the University of South Bohemia and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have helped reveal the most detailed picture to date of important biological “antennae.” Nature has evolved these structures to harness the sun’s energy through photosynthesis, but these sunlight receivers don’t belong to plants. They’re found in microbes known as cyanobacteria, the evolutionary descendants of the first organisms on Earth capable of taking sunlight, water and carbon dioxide and turning them into sugars and oxygen. Published Aug. 31 in the journal Nature, the findings immediately shed new light on microbial photosynthesis — specifically, how light energy is captured and sent to where it’s needed to power the conversion of carbon dioxide into sugars. Going forward, the insights could also help researchers remediate harmful bacteria in the environment, develop artificial photosynthetic systems for renewable energy and enlist microbes in sustainable manufacturing that starts with the raw materials of carbon dioxide and sunlight. “There’s a lot of interest in using cyanobacteria as solar-powered factories that capture sunlight and convert it into a kind of energy that can be used to make important products,” said Cheryl Kerfeld, Hannah Distinguished Professor of structural bioengineering in the College of Natural Science. “With a blueprint like the one we’ve provided in this study, you can start thinking about tuning and optimizing the light-harvesting component of photosynthesis.” “Once you see how something works, you have a better idea of how you can modify it and manipulate it."</em> <a href="https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2022/msu-helps-reveal-blueprint-for-photosynthesis">[...]</a>

Once the motor has been built, our kids can play changing resistances, diodes or capacitors to modify the speed or the torque of the motor. The motor works connected to a USB port (5V and 300mA minimum) or connected to three 6V, 100mA solar panels in serial connection (you can see this solar version on Instagram) It uses a list of materials very easy to find in whatever technology class."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Brushless-DC-Motor-Newman-Motor/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Gainclone-20/">Arduino Gainclone 2.0</a></h2>

<p><em>"After running my Arduino controlled Gainclone amp for the last 8 years, the LCD died and I decided that it was time for a revamp. This instructable is based on the original and is designed to be an 'upgrade' from that. Please see it here - https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Powered-Gainclone-amplifier/ This could also be used just as a sound processor/Input switcher board to attach to a commercial AMP but is designed to add some smarts to a generic home made 2 channel amplifier. This time around: - New graphic based OLED screen - Upgrading to STM32F103 (AKA Bluepill) - Internal RTC (But with no battery, you could add...) - Ditching the Radio Module (because I never used it, and it wasn't implemented well) - Fixed rotary encoder (It worked but not the best) - Ability to set the time from controls - Professionally fabbed board The STM32F103 is like an Arduino (Nano/Uno etc) on steroids. Although it is magnitudes more powerful than the old Atmega32, the reason I have used it for this upgrade is that it has much more programming space that is needed for storing the fonts for the LCD. The code runs at about 160% of the available space in an Atmega32 chip but only takes 40% of the STM32F103CBT6 or 85% of the STM32F103C8T6 at 55840 bytes."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Gainclone-20/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Always I'm interested in how much current is flowing in the electronic circuits I made. Therefore, I had bought a 1A analog current meter before for measuring the power consumption of circuits. But the analog meter is forgotten for a quite long time as I don't know how to use the device to measure current. But recently I'm beginning to use the INA219 module in several DIY projects and becoming quite comfortable with measuring current with live power supply circuits. Therefore, I tried to make some useful power supply devices equipped with two different types of current meters as shown in the picture above. For the DC conversion from 220V AC input and supplying regulated voltage to circuits, a commercially available ready-made switching power supply is used."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Power-Supply-With-Current-Meters/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A common problem when making battery-powered electronic projects is how to have a stable 5V output from a battery that is constantly reduced in voltage. Additionally, when using lithium batteries, you must make sure that the battery is never discharged beyond a set voltage in order to prevent permanent damage to the battery chemistry. To solve this, there are a variety of modules like the TP4056 and others that solve part of the puzzle but it's always up to the project maker to decide how to mount the battery and where to place the control electronics. When working on the RGB play button, I used a power bank module to protect the battery and also to have a way how to charge it and while at it, I came to the idea that I can actually make a custom PCB that can then be used to solve this problem.
