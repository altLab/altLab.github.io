<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1762, o químico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremias_Benjamin_Richter">Jeremias B. Richter</a>. Ele descobriu a lei de proporções equivalentes. Estudou química nos seus tempos livres enquanto esteve no exército prussiano (1778-1785) e depois enquanto ganhava um doutoramento em matemática (1789). Richter foi muito influenciado por Immanuel Kant, a cujas palestras pode ter assistido, na alegação de que a ciência é matemática aplicada. Richter procurou relações matemáticas em química, convencido de que as substâncias reagiam umas com as outras em proporções fixas. Mostrou uma tal relação quando ácidos e bases neutralizam para produzir sais (1791). Assim, ele foi o primeiro a estabelecer a estequiometria, que se tornou a base da análise química quantitativa.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1923, o Físico de partículas norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Val_Logsdon_Fitch">Val Logsdon Fitch</a>. Ele recebeu conjuntamente com James Watson Cronin o Prémio Nobel da Física em 1980, por uma experiência realizada em 1964 que desmentiu a teoria há muito defendida de que a interacção de partículas deveria ser indiferente à direcção do tempo. Trabalhando com Leo James Rainwater, Fitch tinha sido o primeiro a observar radiação de átomos muónicos; ou seja, de espécies em que um muão está em órbita de um núcleo e não de um electrão. Este trabalho indicou que os tamanhos dos núcleos atómicos eram mais pequenos do que se supunha. Continuou a estudar o kaons e em 1964 iniciou a sua colaboração com James Cronin, James Christenson, e René Turley, que levou à descoberta de violações dos princípios de simetria fundamentais na decadência dos K-mesons neutros.</p>

<p>Em 1876, Alexander Graham Bell fez o que foi, na realidade, a primeira chamada telefónica. O seu assistente, Thomas Watson, localizado numa sala adjacente em Boston, ouviu a voz de Bell sobre o dispositivo experimental dizer-lhe: "Sr. Watson, venha cá. Eu quero vê-lo". Esta foi a primeira experiência bem sucedida de Bell com o telefone, que está gravada na entrada 10 Mar do seu caderno de notas do laboratório. Nesse mesmo dia, um ebuliente Bell escreveu ao seu pai sobre o seu "grande sucesso" e especulou que "está a chegar o dia em que os fios do telégrafo [telefone] serão colocados em casas como água e gás - e os amigos conversam uns com os outros sem sair de casa". Bell tinha recebido a primeira patente telefónica três dias antes. Mais tarde, nesse ano, Bell conseguiu fazer uma chamada telefónica através de linhas exteriores.</p>

<p>Em 1977 eram descobertos anéis à volta do planeta Saturno. Os astrónomos há muito que suspeitavam que Úrano tinha anéis, mas a verdadeira descoberta aconteceu por acidente. Uma equipa de três astrónomos estava a utilizar o Observatório Aéreo Kuiper da NASA para observar a atmosfera de Úrano. Fizeram-no durante uma ocultação estelar, o que significa que uma estrela de fundo estava a passar por detrás do planeta. Ver como a luz dessa estrela muda quando passava pela atmosfera podia dar pistas sobre a composição de Úrano.</p>

<p><em>"ST’s new rad-hard components help Low-Earth Orbit satellites shrink the digital divide, expanding communication and earth-observation services STMicroelectronics (NYSE: STM), a global semiconductor leader serving customers across the spectrum of electronics applications, is simplifying the design and volume production of the new generation of reliable small, low-cost satellites to deliver services like earth observation and broadband internet from low-earth orbits (LEOs). ST’s new series of radiation-hardened power, analog, and logic ICs in low-cost plastic packages provide important functions for the satellites’ electronic circuitry. The first nine devices in this series have just been released and include a data converter, a voltage regulator, an LVDS transceiver, a line driver, and five logic gates that are used throughout systems like power generation and distribution, on-board computers, telemetry star trackers, and transceivers. ST will continue to grow the series adding more functions in the coming months to further expand designers’ choices. “We are in a new era of space commercialization and democratization, commonly called New Space, which radically changes the economics of conceiving, building, launching, and operating satellites. These formerly low-volume, specialized space vehicles are quickly becoming commoditized for deployment in large constellations sometimes comprising several thousands of units,” said Marcello San Biagio, General Purpose and RF Division General Manager, STMicroelectronics."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/p4426.html">[...]</a>

NASA’s Psyche mission is almost ready for its moment in the Sun – a 1.5-billion-mile (2.4-billion-kilometer) solar-powered journey to a mysterious, metal-rich asteroid of the same name. Twin solar arrays have been attached to the spacecraft body, unfolded lengthwise, and then restowed. This test brings the craft that much closer to completion before its August launch. “Seeing the spacecraft fully assembled for the first time is a huge accomplishment; there’s a lot of pride,” said Brian Bone, who leads assembly, test, and launch operations for the mission at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. “This is the true fun part."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-psyche-gets-huge-solar-arrays-for-trip-to-metal-rich-asteroid">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Engineering’s Fu, Jiao to refine filament manufacturing for 3D printing In the fight against climate change, one of the biggest challenges is addressing the potential economic and social impacts of shutting down greenhouse-gas producing operations. That’s why it’s so important to find a variety of alternative technologies that can help move communities toward more sustainable futures. Thanks to $1 million in Department of Energy funding, supplemented by another $250,000 in funding from the University of Delaware, Department of Mechanical Engineering Professor Kun (Kelvin) Fu and Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering Professor Feng Jiao will spend the next three years working with students to find efficient and effective ways to use graphene particles from domestic coal wastes in Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printing. The idea is to convert coal to a carbon material, which can then be added to filaments or resins used in the materials needed to feed these high-tech 3D printers. Six other universities and organizations also received millions in DOE funding to explore additive manufacturing alternatives involving coal-derived materials. “Right now, the Department of Energy is looking for new technologies to neutralize coal as a carbon feedstock,” Jiao said."</em> <a href="https://www.udel.edu/udaily/2022/march/engineering-3d-printing/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) have developed a paper-based sensor for detecting even tiny volumes of hydrogen peroxide. This chemical is used widely in household and healthcare products like hand sanitiser as a disinfectant, in rocket fuel as a propellant, and is also found in biological cells. The technique they used involves preparing a gel from a solution containing a specially designed molecule, treated with a liquid that has hydrogen peroxide, and air-drying them on a thin paper disc about 0.45 cm in diameter. The paper disc emits green light when placed under a UV lamp, only in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. The intensity of the light was found to be directly proportional to the concentration of hydrogen peroxide. “You can actually visualise this green emission (photoluminescence) with the naked eye."</em> <a href="https://iisc.ac.in/events/paper-discs-that-can-pick-up-hydrogen-peroxide/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Multilayered perovskite-based films, designed by KAUST researchers, shield high-performance perovskite solar cells from extreme heat and moisture while also boosting their long-term stability, which is a key milestone for device commercialization. Perovskite solar cells have emerged as the fastest growing alternative to the conventional silicon technology that dominates the photovoltaic market. Cheaper and easier to manufacture, they have shown a dramatic continual rise in performance, potentially surpassing their silicon-based equivalents. However, inherent surface defects and ion migration affect the stability of the light-responsive perovskite film, a phenomenon that becomes more pronounced at higher temperatures. Sandwiched between charge carrier-selective materials, the three-dimensional (3D) perovskite film converts light to electricity by creating pairs of electrons and positively charged holes. Upon charge separation and collection, electrons migrate toward the "n-type" layer while holes migrate toward the "p-type" layer, producing an electric current."</em> <a href="https://discovery.kaust.edu.sa/en/article/1227/a-tailored-coat-to-beat-the-heat">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/solid-state-batteries-interface-stability-0308">Toward batteries that pack twice as much energy per pound</a></h2>

<p><em>"A method for stabilizing the interfaces in solid-state lithium-ion batteries opens new possibilities. In the endless quest to pack more energy into batteries without increasing their weight or volume, one especially promising technology is the solid-state battery. In these batteries, the usual liquid electrolyte that carries charges back and forth between the electrodes is replaced with a solid electrolyte layer. Such batteries could potentially not only deliver twice as much energy for their size, they also could virtually eliminate the fire hazard associated with today’s lithium-ion batteries. But one thing has held back solid-state batteries: Instabilities at the boundary between the solid electrolyte layer and the two electrodes on either side can dramatically shorten the lifetime of such batteries. Some studies have used special coatings to improve the bonding between the layers, but this adds the expense of extra coating steps in the fabrication process."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/solid-state-batteries-interface-stability-0308">[...]</a>

<p><em>"New approach lays groundwork for compact 3D displays that create more realistic virtual scenes Researchers have demonstrated a prototype glasses-free 3D light field display system with a significantly extended viewing distance thanks to a newly developed flat lens. The system is an important step toward compact, realistic-looking 3D displays that could be used for televisions, portable electronics and table-top devices. Light field displays use a dense field of light rays to produce full-color real-time 3D videos that can be viewed without glasses. This approach to creating a 3D display allows several people to view the virtual scene at once, much like a real 3D object. “Most light field 3D displays have a limited viewing range, which causes the 3D virtual image to degrade as the observer moves farther away from the device,” said research team leader Wen Qiao from Soochow University. “The nanostructured flat lens we designed is just 100 microns thick and has a very large depth of focus, which enables a high-quality virtual 3D scene to be seen from farther away.” In Optica, Optica Publishing Group’s journal for high-impact research, the researchers report that their prototype display exhibits high efficiency and high color fidelity over viewing distances from 24 cm to 90 cm."</em> <a href="https://www.optica.org/en-us/about/newsroom/news_releases/2022/february/researchers_use_flat_lenses_to_extend_viewing_dist/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A collaborative study led by the University of Wollongong confirms switching mechanism for a new, proposed generation of ultra-low energy ‘topological electronics’. Based on novel quantum topological materials, such devices would ‘switch’ a topological insulator from non-conducting (conventional electrical insulator) to a conducting (topological insulator) state, whereby electrical current could flow along its edge states without wasted dissipation of energy. Such topological electronics could radically reduce the energy consumed in computing and electronics, which is estimated to consume 8% of global electricity, and doubling every decade. Led by Dr Muhammad Nadeem at the University of Wollongong (UOW), the study also brought in expertise from FLEET Centre collaborators at UNSW and Monash University. RESOLVING THE SWITCHING CHALLENGE, AND INTRODUCING THE TQFET Two-dimensional topological insulators are promising materials for topological quantum electronic devices where edge state transport can be controlled by a gate-induced electric field. However, a major challenge with such electric-field-induced topological switching has been the requirement for an unrealistically large electric field to close the topological bandgap."</em> <a href="https://www.fleet.org.au/blog/a-zigzag-blueprint-for-topological-electronics/">[...]</a>

Now, a new article in Nature Communications, written by researchers from Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, and MIT, USA, presents results that cast new light on important challenges in understanding quantum gravity. A grand challenge in modern theoretical physics is to find a ‘unified theory’ that can describe all the laws of nature within a single framework – connecting Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the universe on a large scale, and quantum mechanics, which describes our world at the atomic level.

He noticed the typical materials used for these critical protective devices don’t perform well at higher speeds and often aren’t reusable.

<p><em>"A mathematical analysis helps illuminate the puzzle over how information escapes from a black hole A RIKEN physicist and two colleagues have found that a wormhole—a bridge connecting distant regions of the Universe—helps to shed light on the mystery of what happens to information about matter consumed by black holes1. Einstein’s theory of general relativity predicts that nothing that falls into a black hole can escape its clutches. But in the 1970s, Stephen Hawking calculated that black holes should emit radiation when quantum mechanics, the theory governing the microscopic realm, is considered. “This is called black hole evaporation because the black hole shrinks, just like an evaporating water droplet,” explains Kanato Goto of the RIKEN Interdisciplinary Theoretical and Mathematical Sciences. This, however, led to a paradox. Eventually, the black hole will evaporate entirely—and so too will any information about its swallowed contents."</em> <a href="https://www.riken.jp/en/news_pubs/research_news/rr/20220308_1/index.html">[...]</a>

But receivers must be able to ‘guess’ the transmitted quantum state, incurring a cost called ‘guesswork.’ Recently, researchers have derived analytical solutions of the guesswork problem for when the ensemble is subject to a finite set of conditions. The results constitute a first step towards future algorithms for quantum software. Given the rapid pace at which technology is developing, it comes as no surprise that quantum technologies will become commonplace within decades. A big part of ushering in this new age of quantum computing requires a new understanding of both classical and quantum information and how the two can be related to each other.

In their quest to find more useful superconductors, Ramshaw, the Dick &amp; Dale Reis Johnson Assistant Professor of physics in the College of Arts and Sciences (A&amp;S), and colleagues have discovered that magnetism is key to understanding the behavior of electrons in “high-temperature” superconductors.

<p><em>"The goal here was two-fold; create something stylish that would look good when hung up on a wall, and ensure that all movements were as quiet as possible! I was inspired by some great existing projects that I have bookmarked below, but most had used noisy servos. Using my idea to retrofit silent stepper drivers from 3D printers, I built, tested and coded my clock completely from scratch over 2-3 months of my spare time. Motor choice. For the purpose of making all movements as quiet as possible, I wanted to completely avoid using servo motors (which ruled out 5 of my 6 inspirations…). Servos are not designed for silent operation."</em> <a href="https://davidmcdaid.wordpress.com/2022/03/08/electromechanical-7-segment-display/">[...]</a>

Introduction In this tutorial we would like to show you how to implement a simple AI based gesture recognition with AIfES® on the Wio Terminal. The special thing here is that everything is implemented directly on the Wio Terminal without the need for a PC. Three different gestures can be trained. As AI an artificial neural network (ANN) is used, which can be trained with the Adam optimizer in AIfES® directly on the device. The internal 3-axis digital accelerometer (LIS3DHTR) is used for the gesture recognition."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/aifes_team/wio-terminal-ai-gesture-recognition-with-on-device-training-13b636">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Hi all, since I m planning to use solar modules and accumulators to provide energy for some of my next projects, I have to find out how much power every circuit needs. One way is to connect a multimeter in series with the load to measure the current. With the help of the current I would be able to calculate the power and work. But the connection of the multimeter for every circuit needs time for wiring. Furthermore I would have to observe the measurement all time and would be difficult to get a overall picture from many single measurements. Therefore I build a power monitor to measure the power consumption of my components fast and easy."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Power-Monitor-for-Electronic-Prototypes-and-Device/">[...]</a>

Let me first tell you about the main working principle of this robot: This car uses a very working principle that is as follows: ~ When the car reaches the end of the table i.e. the edge of the table the ultrasonic sensor detects the depth of it and it makes the car go back. If you have not understood its working principle then take a look at the whole tutorial you might then understand it...

However, recently, I have started to feel a precipitous pain on my forearm after utilizing the mouse longer than six hours. Therefore, I decided to create this project to get prescient warnings regarding forearm muscle soreness levels so as to prevent any injury risks. Since utilizing the mouse involves monotonous movements of the same small muscle groups for protracted periods of time, overusing the mouse by positioning, traveling, scrolling, and clicking can make these muscle groups tired and overworked. Hence, after repetitive overexposure to monotonous mouse movements, muscle stress (soreness) increases precipitously and can engender[1]: Pain (ache, soreness) on the top of the hand Pain (ache, soreness) around the wrist Pain (ache, soreness) along the forearm and the elbow Numbness and tingling in the thumb and the index finger Burning, stiffness, restricted range of motion Also, it can cause soreness and fatigue by putting extra strain on the muscles in the upper back (trapezius muscle) and shoulder (deltoid muscle)."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Mouse-Fatigue-Estimation-by-GSR-and-EMG-Values-W-T/">[...]</a>
