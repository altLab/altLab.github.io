<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1753, o químico e físico experimental alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Karl_Achard">Franz Karl Achard</a>. Ele inventou um processo para a extracção em grande escala de açúcar de mesa (sacarose) da beterraba, e em 1801, abriu a primeira fábrica de beterraba, na Silésia (actualmente Polónia). No início, embora simples, o método era dispendioso, melhorou-o utilizando sugestões do Instituto em França, incluindo que as beterrabas fossem prensadas sem serem cozinhadas, o que poupou muitas despesas de combustível. Ele tinha sucedido Andreas Sigismund Marggrafupon na sua morte (1782) como director da "Classe de Física" na Academia de Berlim. Foi Marggraf que descobriu pela primeira vez a presença de açúcar na raiz da beterraba, e isolou-a numa escala experimental em 1747. Achard descobriu também um método para trabalhar a platina e foi o primeiro a preparar um cadinho de platina (1784).</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1831, o físico e matemático escocês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Tait_(physicist)">Peter Tait</a>. Ele ajudou a desenvolver quaternions, que promoveu fortemente, e escreveu um tratado padrão sobre o assunto. O seu trabalho ajudou a fazer avançar a física matemática moderna. Tait fez muito trabalho experimental em termodinâmica, e apresentou uma série de artigos sobre a teoria cinética dos gases (1886-92). Dos seus muitos livros sobre física, o seu mais conhecido foi co-autor com William Thomson (mais tarde Lord Kelvin), um livro de física matemática, Treatise on Natural Philosophy (1876). Para além de investigar o ozono, gases e electricidade, Tait criou um aparelho para emitir grandes anéis de vórtice de fumo estáveis. A partir de outros trabalhos experimentais, construiu modelos matemáticos do voo de uma bola de golfe.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1854, a engenheira electrotécnica, inventora e matemática inglesa <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertha_Ayrton">Hertha Ayrton</a>. Ela inventou um esfigmógrafo (um dispositivo que traça batidas de pulso, embora não o primeiro), um divisor de linhas (um instrumento de desenho para dividir uma linha num determinado número de partes iguais, 1884) e um ventilador anti-gás (flapper) utilizado durante a Primeira Guerra Mundial. Começou a trabalhar com William Ayrton, com quem se casou posteriormente (1884). Retomando o interesse do seu marido em experiências de arco eléctrico, Hertha concebeu melhorias que tornaram as luzes de arco mais silenciosas e mais fiáveis. Ela publicou The Electric Arc (1902). Como mulher, foi-lhe negada uma licenciatura de Cambridge, e no início recusou-se a ser membro da Royal Society (1902).</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1900, o físico e astrónomo holandês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Oort">Jan Oort</a>. Ele foi uma das figuras mais importantes nos esforços do século XX para compreender a natureza da galáxia da Via Láctea, que mediu a rotação da galáxia da Terra e formulou a hipótese de uma "Nuvem de Oort". Em 1927 Oort analisou movimentos de estrelas distantes, encontrou provas de rotação diferencial e fundou a teoria matemática da estrutura galáctica. Após a Segunda Guerra Mundial, liderou o grupo holandês que utilizou a linha de 21 cm para mapear o gás hidrogénio na Galáxia. Encontraram a estrutura espiral em grande escala, o centro galáctico, e os movimentos das nuvens de gás. Em 1950 Oort propôs o modelo agora geralmente aceite para a origem dos cometas.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1906, o matemático <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del">Kurt Gödel</a>. Ele é conhecido pela sua prova dos Teoremas de Incompletude de Gödel (1931) Ele provou resultados fundamentais sobre sistemas axiomáticos, mostrando que em qualquer sistema matemático axiomático existem propostas que não podem ser provadas ou refutadas dentro dos axiomas do sistema. Em particular, a consistência dos axiomas não pode ser provada. Isto pôs fim a uma centena de anos de tentativas de estabelecer axiomas para colocar toda a matemática numa base axiomática.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1916, o inventor, mecânico e engenheiro italiano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferruccio_Lamborghini">Ferruccio Lamborghini</a>. Ele trabalhou como mecânico no exército italiano durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial, e após a guerra fundou uma empresa de tractores. Ele fundou uma empresa automóvel de luxo que produziu alguns dos carros desportivos mais rápidos, mais caros e mais procurados do mundo.</p>

<p>Em 1926, o termo "mecânica das ondas" foi cunhado pelo físico nuclear Erwin Schrödinger numa carta que ele enviou a Albert Einstein. O termo foi aplicado ao novo ramo emergente da física que interpreta o comportamento das partículas subatómicas de acordo com uma descrição matemática em termos de um movimento ondulatório.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou o helicóptero Inge­nuity da NASA inspeccionou recentemente tanto o pára-quedas que ajudou o rover Perseverance a aterrar em Marte, como a concha em forma de cone que protegia o veículo no espaço profundo e durante a sua descida em chamas em direcção à superfície marciana. A entrada, descida e aterragem em Marte é rápida e stressante, não só para os engenheiros de volta à Terra, mas também para o veículo que suporta as forças gravitacionais, altas temperaturas e outros extremos que vêm com a entrada na atmosfera de Marte a quase 20.000 km/h. O pára-quedas e a concha de trás foram previamente imersos à distância pelo rover Perseverance.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou, a SpaceX lançou o foguetão Falcon 9 transportando a nave Dragon com a equipa Crew-4 de astronautas, a partir do Centro Espacial Kennedy da NASA, na Florida, em direção à Estação Espacial Internacional. A tripulação internacional de astronautas servirá como a quarta missão comercial de rotação da tripulação a bordo da Estação Espacial. Os últimos dias no Kennedy Space Center têm sido inspiradores e ocupados com o regresso da tripulação da Axiom e agora o lançamento bem sucedido dos astronautas Crew-4 para a Estação Espacial Internacional. Este é o quinto voo SpaceX com astronautas da NASA - incluindo o voo de teste Demo-2 em 2020 para a estação espacial - como parte do Programa de Tripulação Comercial da agência.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker e alguns vídeos interessantes. É apresentada a revista Hackspace nº54 de Maio assim como o Service Manual do ZX Spectrum que faz 40 anos esta semana que foi lançado.</p>

<p><em>"Eyeing some of the components that enabled the rover to get safely to the Martian surface could provide valuable insights for future missions. NASA’s Ingenuity Mars Helicopter recently surveyed both the parachute that helped the agency’s Perseverance rover land on Mars and the cone-shaped backshell that protected the rover in deep space and during its fiery descent toward the Martian surface on Feb. 18, 2021. Engineers with the Mars Sample Return program asked whether Ingenuity could provide this perspective. What resulted were 10 aerial color images taken April 19 during Ingenuity’s Flight 26. “NASA extended Ingenuity flight operations to perform pioneering flights such as this,” said Teddy Tzanetos, Ingenuity’s team lead at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. “Every time we’re airborne, Ingenuity covers new ground and offers a perspective no previous planetary mission could achieve."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/nasa-s-mars-helicopter-spots-gear-that-helped-perseverance-rover-land">[...]</a>

The international crew of astronauts will serve as the fourth commercial crew rotation mission aboard the space station. A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket propelled the Dragon spacecraft into orbit carrying Mission Commander Kjell Lindgren, Pilot Bob Hines, and Mission Specialist Jessica Watkins, all NASA astronauts, and Mission Specialist Samantha Cristoforetti of ESA (European Space Agency). The crew will conduct a science expedition in microgravity aboard the space station. “Liftoff! The past few days at Kennedy Space Center have been inspiring and busy with the return of the Axiom crew and now the successful launch of Crew-4 astronauts to the International Space Station,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-spacex-crew-4-astronauts-launch-to-international-space-station">[...]</a>

(Nasdaq: MCHP) today announces the release of five new product families and over 60 new individual devices that offer embedded designers simple solutions to their most common problems. Designers who are looking to create innovative designs are turning to Microchip’s new product families of PIC and AVR MCUs because of their processing power, ability to easily communicate with other chips, and analog peripherals that have been built to be exceptionally configurable without having to make changes to the Printed Circuit Board (PCB). These devices combine ASIC-like capabilities with a simple development experience that extends traditional MCU capabilities and allows them to be configured as smart peripheral chips. Smart peripherals, like the software-controlled op amp found on the PIC16F171 family, the Multi-Voltage I/O (MVIO) and Analog-to-Digital Converter with Computation (ADCC) add value to applications that otherwise would not use traditional MCUs."</em> <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/about/news-releases/products/pic-avr-microcontrollers-anchor-majority-of-embedded-designs">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Parallel ice ridges, a common feature on Jupiter’s moon Europa, are found on Greenland’s ice sheet – and could bode well for Europa’s potential habitability. Parallel ice ridges in Greenland bear a striking resemblance to ridges on Jupiter’s ice-encased moon Europa, suggesting the moon’s icy shell could be riddled with pockets of water. This similarity could greatly improve the odds of NASA’s Europa Clipper mission detecting potentially habitable environments on the Jovian moon. The spacecraft’s ice-penetrating radar instrument REASON (short for Radar for Europa Assessment and Sounding: Ocean to Near-surface) will be ideal for conducting such a search. “If there are pockets of water under the ridges, we have the right instruments to see them,” said Dustin Schroeder, a Stanford University associate professor and coauthor of a new study comparing Greenland’s “double ridges” with those of Europa. Scientists say evidence gathered so far shows that Europa harbors a deep liquid ocean, hidden beneath an ice shell that could be 10 to 15 miles (15 to 25 kilometers) thick."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/greenland-ice-jupiter-moon-share-similar-feature">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Harnessing the power that makes the sun and stars shine could be made easier by powerful magnets with straighter shapes than have been made before. Researchers linked to the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) have found a way to create such magnets for fusion facilities known as stellarators. Such facilities have complex twisted magnetic coils, compared with the straight up-and-down coils in more widely used tokamak facilities, and can produce fusion reactions without the risk of disruptions that tokamaks face. This advantage makes stellarators a candidate to serve as the model for a next-generation fusion pilot plant. Now, by adding sections to the stellarator coils that are relatively straight, researchers could both reduce the manufacturing cost and make it easier to install openings that would allow technicians to repair the device’s interior. Both innovations could aid the development of a stellarator power plant, replicating fusion on Earth for a virtually inexhaustible supply of power to generate electricity without producing greenhouse gases or long-lived radioactive waste."</em> <a href="https://www.pppl.gov/news/2022/researchers-design-simpler-magnets-twisty-facilities-could-lead-steady-state-fusion">[...]</a>

Physicists at the University of California, Irvine have demonstrated the use of a hydrogen molecule as a quantum sensor in a terahertz laser-equipped scanning tunneling microscope, a technique that can measure the chemical properties of materials at unprecedented time and spatial resolutions. This new technique can also be applied to analysis of two-dimensional materials which have the potential to play a role in advanced energy systems, electronics and quantum computers.

While these landscapes may look familiar, they are composed of materials that are undoubtedly different – liquid methane streams streak Titan’s icy surface and nitrogen winds build hydrocarbon sand dunes. The presence of these materials – whose mechanical properties are vastly different from those of silicate-based substances that make up other known sedimentary bodies in our solar system – makes Titan’s landscape formation enigmatic.

<p><em>"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) researchers have developed a new all-optical ultrasound technique capable of performing on-demand characterization of melt tracks and detecting formation of defects in a popular metal 3D printing process. In a paper published by Scientific Reports, Lab researchers propose a diagnostic using surface acoustic waves (SAW), generated by laser-based ultrasound, that can reveal tiny surface and sub-surface defects in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) metal 3D-printing. The team reported the system they developed can effectively and accurately evaluate laser melt lines — the tracks where the laser liquifies metal powder in LPBF printing — by scattering acoustic energy from melt lines, voids and surface features that can be quickly detected. The team validated the findings using optical microscopy and X-ray computed tomography (CT). “We hope that this work demonstrates the potential for an all-optical ultrasound system capable of rapid, on-demand in situ characterization of LPBF processes and powders,” said LLNL engineer and principal investigator David Stobbe. “The demonstrated laser-based ultrasound, surface acoustic wave system showed excellent sensitivity to surface and near-surface features, including breaks in the LPBF melt line, metal surface splatter and subsurface air voids.” Surface acoustic waves have historically been used to characterize surface and near-surface features such as cracks, pits and welds in engineering materials, and are used in geology — at a much larger length scale — for detecting subterranean features such as caves."</em> <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/news/laser-based-ultrasound-detects-defect-producing-features-metal-3d-printing">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator has restarted after a break of more than three years for maintenance, consolidation and upgrade work. Today, 22 April, at 12:16 CEST, two beams of protons circulated in opposite directions around the Large Hadron Collider’s 27-kilometre ring at their injection energy of 450 billion electronvolts (450 GeV). “These beams circulated at injection energy and contained a relatively small number of protons. High-intensity, high-energy collisions are a couple of months away,” says the Head of CERN’s Beams department, Rhodri Jones. “But first beams represent the successful restart of the accelerator after all the hard work of the long shutdown.” “The machines and facilities underwent major upgrades during the second long shutdown of CERN’s accelerator complex,” says CERN’s Director for Accelerators and Technology, Mike Lamont. “The LHC itself has undergone an extensive consolidation programme and will now operate at an even higher energy and, thanks to major improvements in the injector complex, it will deliver significantly more data to the upgraded LHC experiments.” Pilot beams circulated in the LHC for a brief period in October 2021."</em> <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=119563">[...]</a>

<p><em>"NASA innovators recently developed a new metal alloy using a 3D printing process that dramatically improves the strength and durability of the components and parts used in aviation and space exploration, resulting in better and longer-lasting performance. NASA Alloy GRX-810, an oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) alloy, can endure temperatures over 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, is more malleable, and can survive more than 1,000 times longer than existing state-of-the-art alloys. These new alloys can be used to build aerospace parts for high temperature applications, like those inside aircraft and rocket engines, because ODS alloys can withstand harsher conditions before reaching their breaking point. “The nanoscale oxide particles convey the incredible performance benefits of this alloy,” said Dale Hopkins, deputy project manager of NASA’s Transformational Tools and Technologies project. It's challenging and expensive to produce ODS alloys for these extreme environments. To develop NASA Alloy GRX-810, agency researchers used computational models to determine the alloy’s composition."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/glenn/2022/nasa-s-new-material-built-to-withstand-extreme-conditions">[...]</a>

When that happens, where will we get all the plastic we need for, well, nearly everything? Most plastics today come from petroleum. About three-quarters of every barrel of oil goes to make gasoline, diesel and jet fuel; the remaining quarter goes to other products, including plastic. Making it from petroleum is doubly problematic as it helps perpetuate our global dependence on fossil energy and it continues the long-term environmental degradation caused by synthetic plastics, which can take several hundred years to break down into simpler materials. The entwined challenges of transitioning to renewable, non-fossil energy sources and developing environmentally friendly plastics highlight the breadth of the broader challenge of decarbonizing our economy for a sustainable future."</em> <a href="https://discover.lanl.gov/news/0426-bioplastics">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The flexible, thin-film device has the potential to make any surface into a low-power, high-quality audio source. MIT engineers have developed a paper-thin loudspeaker that can turn any surface into an active audio source. This thin-film loudspeaker produces sound with minimal distortion while using a fraction of the energy required by a traditional loudspeaker. The hand-sized loudspeaker the team demonstrated, which weighs about as much as a dime, can generate high-quality sound no matter what surface the film is bonded to. To achieve these properties, the researchers pioneered a deceptively simple fabrication technique, which requires only three basic steps and can be scaled up to produce ultrathin loudspeakers large enough to cover the inside of an automobile or to wallpaper a room. Used this way, the thin-film loudspeaker could provide active noise cancellation in clamorous environments, such as an airplane cockpit, by generating sound of the same amplitude but opposite phase; the two sounds cancel each other out."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/low-power-thin-loudspeaker-0426">[...]</a>

Since the first successful fabrication of a two-dimensional structure of carbon atoms about 20 years ago, graphene has fascinated scientists. A few years ago, researchers discovered that two layers of graphene, slightly twisted against each other, can conduct electric current without loss. In recent years, this discovery has prompted scientists to explore such layered materials in greater detail.

<p><em>"New low-temperature coating technique poised to enable high-quality 3D printed microlens systems for applications from endoscopes to virtual reality Researchers have developed a new way to apply antireflective (AR) coatings to 3D printed multi-lens systems as small as 600 microns in diameter. Because these coatings help minimize light losses due to reflection, they are critical for making high-quality 3D printed systems consisting of multiple microlenses. “Our new method will benefit any 3D printed complex optical system that uses multiple lenses,” said research team leader Harald Giessen from the University of Stuttgart in Germany. “However, it is especially useful for applications such as miniature fiber endoscopes, which require high-quality optics and are used for imaging under less-than-ideal lighting conditions.” Large lenses like the ones used in a camera are coated before they are assembled into a device. However, for 3D printed lenses less than 1 millimeter wide, conventional coating techniques such as sputtering cannot be used. This is because the whole lens system is typically printed in a single step that forms hard-to-reach hollow openings and undercuts."</em> <a href="https://www.optica.org/en-us/about/newsroom/news_releases/2022/april/researchers_add_antireflection_coatings_to_complex/">[...]</a>

How to Almost Build a Beer Pong Playing Robot In April of 2021 I was looking for a project to spend my ample amount of free time on. For some reason a beer pong playing robot popped into my head. At a high level I envisioned a robot that would use a camera to find cups and fire a ping pong ball at said cups. I decided a Raspberry Pi would be used as the “brain” and would handle the image processing. The Raspberry Pi would tell an Arduino how to orientate the firing mechanism."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/inconceivable42/how-to-almost-build-a-beer-pong-playing-robot-bab85e">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Project Eden is a fully IoT equipped station that has the ability to monitor the humidity, moisture and temperature surrounding the soil. It also parses data from Willyweather (local weather station) to determine if a rain event is occuring, and interlock the pump if so. There is a graphical interface I have setup on node-red to allow 24/7 monitoring, data collection and control of the plant. The peristaltic pump has the ability to draw water from a bucket, which contains a float level switch in order to keep track of the water available for the pump. Materials - IP56 Rated Junction Box ($20) - Wemos D1 Mini ($10) - DHT11 Temperature &amp; Humidity Sensor ($10) - Soil Moisture Sensor ($5) - 5V Relay ($5) - Cable Gland ($2) - 6V Grothen Peristaltic Pump ($20) - Spare/Scrap Wood - 5V Power Supply ($10) - Jumper Wires - Raspberry Pi or Laptop for node-red server - Vinyl Tubing Composition Below is the schematic of the electronic components. First lets talk about the pump."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/engineeringfather/project-eden-smart-garden-42670f">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.hackster.io/nickbild/vectron-vga-plus-v2-b396f5">Vectron VGA Plus v2</a></h2>

<p><em>"Vectron VGA Plus v2 generates a 640x480@60Hz VGA signal and has an interface that works with retro computers or Arduino. How It Works Vectron VGA Plus v2 is an improvement on the earlier design. The key to the simplified design of the Vectron VGA Plus boards is to use more RAM and less logic. So, for example, instead of having counters and flip flops, etc. to time each horizontal sync, that logic is embedded in the data in memory. Memory addresses are sequentially incremented by an osciallator, and the contents of each memory address specify what signals to output (R/G/B/H sync/V sync)."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/nickbild/vectron-vga-plus-v2-b396f5">[...]</a>

But when you look on the web most ESP32cam projects are very similar: "here's an ESP32cam, let's connect it to a PC over Wi-Fi and use the PC to recognise a face or record video". The ESP32cam is acting as not much more than a wireless webcam. It is simply a peripheral to a PC. It should be capable of more than that.

No, I'm using some heavy duty materials which will feed the power hungry Raspberry Pi 4B, 24/7. I see many tutorials online for building a Raspberry Pi UPS with different components.
