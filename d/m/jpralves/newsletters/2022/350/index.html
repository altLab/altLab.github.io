<p>Faz hoje anos que, em 1864, físico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Wien">Wilhelm Wien</a>. Ele recebeu o Prémio Nobel da Física em 1911 pela sua lei de deslocamento relativa à radiação emitida pelo corpo negro perfeitamente eficiente (uma superfície que absorve toda a energia radiante que cai sobre ele). Ao estudar os fluxos de gás ionizado Wien, em 1898, identificou uma partícula positiva igual em massa ao átomo de hidrogénio. Wien, com este trabalho, lançou as bases da espectroscopia de massa. J. J. Thomson refinou o aparelho de Viena e realizou novas experiências em 1913, depois, após o trabalho de Ernest Rutherford em 1919, a partícula de Viena foi aceite e baptizada com o nome de protão. Wien também fez importantes contribuições para o estudo dos raios catódicos, raios X e raios de canal.</p>

<p>O nascimento da radiodifusão pública é atribuído a Lee de Forest, que transmitiu a primeira emissão pública mundial em Nova Iorque a 13 de Janeiro de 1910. Esta emissão apresentava as vozes de Enrico Caruso e de outras estrelas da Ópera Metropolitana. Membros do público e da imprensa utilizaram auscultadores para ouvir a emissão em vários locais de toda a cidade. Isto marcou o início do que viria a ser uma comunicação rádio sem fios quase universal.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou foi lançado o Kernel de Linux 5.16. A grande novidade desta versão é a introdução de uma nova system call chamada FUTEX2 ou  futex_waitv(). Contribuído pela Collabora, esta funcionalidade poderá ajudar a melhorar a experiência de jogos nativos Linux mas, mais concretamente, para jogos Windows a correr via Wine. Permite que os jogos esperem por múltiplos 'futexes' com uma única chamada de sistema, o que deverá ajudar a reduzir a utilização da CPU e aumentar o FPS para muitos jogos. Adicionalmente os relatórios de estabilidade dos sistemas de ficheiros (filesystems) recebem uma grande melhoria com uma nova API baseada no fanotify, embora actualmente apenas suportado em sistemas EXT4.
Cada actualização do Kernel melhora o suporte gráfico, e esta 5.16 não é excepção, oferecendo DisplayPort 2.0 ao driver da GPU AMD antes das placas de próxima geração que o distribuem; mais trabalho de base para gráficos DG2/Alchemist e, relacionado, suporte 'estável' para gráficos Intel Alder Lake S (i.e. DG1). Foi adicionado suporte para as instruções Intel AMX, assim como para os controladores Joy-Con e Pro da Nintendo e para o DualSense LED em controladores Playstation 5. Foram feitas melhorias ao nível do suporte de diversos dispositivos Microsoft Surface e um novo driver para o Realtek 802.11ax. Resta agora aguardar que as distribuições main-stream peguem neste kernel e o disponibilizem compilado para as mesmas.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker e alguns vídeos interessantes.</p>

<p><em>"The Linux Kernel just received its major update of the year — and if you’re a gamer, it’s a corker! Linus Torvalds announced the availability of Linux kernel 5.16 exactly where he always announces it: the Linux kernel mailing list. The Linux 5.16 release was delayed by week or so due to the appearance of a red-suited bearded fellow, something Torvalds notes in his announcement where he quips: “we had that extra week due to the holidays, and it’s not like we had lots of last-minute things that needed to be sorted out”. So what’s new? What’s New in Linux 5.16? Well, Linux 5.16 introduces a new kernel system called called FUTEX2, or futex_waitv()."</em> <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2022/01/new-features-in-linux-kernel-5-16-release">[...]</a>

<p><em>"On Wednesday, Dec. 29 (sol 306) Perseverance successfully cored and extracted a sample from a Mars rock. Data downlinked after the sampling indicates that coring of the rock the science team nicknamed Issole went smoothly. However, during the transfer of the bit that contains the sample into the rover’s bit carousel (which stores bits and passes tubes to the tube processing hardware inside the rover), our sensors indicated an anomaly. The rover did as it was designed to do - halting the caching procedure and calling home for further instructions. This is only the 6th time in human history a sample has been cored from a rock on a planet other than Earth, so when we see something anomalous going on, we take it slow. Here is what we know so far, and what we are doing about it."</em> <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/status/356/assessing-perseverances-seventh-sample-collection/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.space.com/mile-wide-asteroid-safe-flyby">A 3,400-foot-wide asteroid will make a safe flyby of Earth next week</a></h2>

<p><em>"A huge asteroid will safely whiz by our planet next week. The asteroid, known as 7482 (1994 PC1), will make its closest approach to our planet on Jan. 18 at 4:51 p.m. EST (2151 GMT), according to a table from the Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS), managed by NASA at the agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. The 3,400-foot (1 kilometer) asteroid will zoom by our planet at the equivalent of five lunar distances at its closest approach, the table indicates, at a top speed of nearly 12 miles per second (20 km/s). At this distance, this will be a safe flyby, and the closest one the asteroid will make of Earth in the next 200 years, according to EarthSky. Asteroids are space rocks that are leftovers of the early solar system when our neighborhood was filled with objects like it. Tens of thousands of asteroids exist but only a subset of them pass close enough to Earth to be termed near-Earth objects (NEOs)."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/mile-wide-asteroid-safe-flyby">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) has capped off the first seven months of its survey run by smashing through all previous records for three-dimensional galaxy surveys, creating the largest and most detailed map of the universe ever. Yet it’s only about 10% of the way through its five-year mission. Once completed, that phenomenally detailed 3D map will yield a better understanding of dark energy, and thereby give physicists and astronomers a better understanding of the past – and future – of the universe. Meanwhile, the impressive technical performance and literally cosmic achievements of the survey thus far are helping scientists reveal the secrets of the most powerful sources of light in the universe. DESI is an international science collaboration managed by the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) with primary funding for construction and operations from DOE’s Office of Science. DESI scientists are presenting the performance of the instrument, and some early astrophysics results, this week at a Berkeley Lab-hosted webinar called CosmoPalooza, which will also feature updates from other leading cosmology experiments."</em> <a href="https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2022/01/13/dark-energy-spectroscopic-instrument-desi-creates-largest-3d-map-of-the-cosmos/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The discovery could offer a route to smaller, faster electronic devices. In the particle world, sometimes two is better than one. Take, for instance, electron pairs. When two electrons are bound together, they can glide through a material without friction, giving the material special superconducting properties. Such paired electrons, or Cooper pairs, are a kind of hybrid particle — a composite of two particles that behaves as one, with properties that are greater than the sum of its parts. Now MIT physicists have detected another kind of hybrid particle in an unusual, two-dimensional magnetic material."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/physicists-detect-hybrid-particle-held-together-uniquely-intense-glue-0110">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Important optimization algorithms that are designed to solve large-scale problems such as airline schedules and supply chain logistics may soon get a boost from 2D materials that will enable the algorithms to better solve the problems and use less energy, according to Penn State researchers. These large-scale issues are known as combinatorial optimization problems, the term for a set of problems that are so complex that finding the best solution using an exhaustive search is sometimes unfeasible. Therefore, algorithms are valuable tools in solving these problems by finding the best possible solution. “These are problems that we face in our everyday life, such as scheduling of transportation or supply chain logistics, and you need to really optimize the best way of doing it correctly,” said Saptarshi Das, associate professor of engineering science and mechanics and primary investigator for the study that was recently published in Advanced Materials. “One famous example is the Traveling Salesman Problem, where a salesman has to go from city A to city B to city C to city D, but he has to find the optimal route where he can visit each city exactly once in the shortest time and return home.” These problems are important ones to solve, as they affect how fast we receive goods and services, how expensive they are for customers and how efficient our society’s logistics are for anything from defense to transportation. “Somebody has to solve these problems but the amount of resources needed from a computational perspective is enormous in order to run these algorithms,” Das said."</em> <a href="https://www.psu.edu/news/materials-research-institute/story/solving-big-problems-algorithms-enhanced-2d-materials/">[...]</a>

Can the 36 officers be arranged in a 6-by-6 square so that no row or column repeats a rank or regiment? The puzzle is easily solved when there are five ranks and five regiments, or seven ranks and seven regiments. But after searching in vain for a solution for the case of 36 officers, Euler concluded that “such an arrangement is impossible, though we can’t give a rigorous demonstration of this.” More than a century later, the French mathematician Gaston Tarry proved that, indeed, there was no way to arrange Euler’s 36 officers in a 6-by-6 square without repetition. In 1960, mathematicians used computers to prove that solutions exist for any number of regiments and ranks greater than two, except, curiously, six.

Lead author of the paper, Professor Jamieson said his team’s vision was to use this technique to build a very, very large-scale quantum device. “We believe we ultimately could make large-scale machines based on single atom quantum bits by using our method and taking advantage of the manufacturing techniques that the semiconductor industry has perfected,” Professor Jamieson said. The technique takes advantage of the precision of the atomic force microscope, which has a sharp cantilever that responds to the force fields above the surface of a chip with a positioning accuracy of just half a nanometre, about the same as the spacing between atoms in a silicon crystal. The team drilled a tiny hole in this cantilever, so that when it was showered with phosphorus atoms one would occasionally drop through the hole and embed in the silicon substrate."</em> <a href="https://about.unimelb.edu.au/newsroom/news/2022/january/atom-by-atom-new-silicon-computer-chip-technique-opens-up-quantum-computing-construction-possibilities">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Making a simple quadruped which can move in a straight under static stability. Preface This robot was built from scratch and I had to reiterate on the core concepts a couple times. It was built under tight time constraints. The final product here is not a 100% working model (yet) due to some software and hardware kinks ( I'll list the ones I found below). The codes have been put on my GitHub repository and any and all suggestions to improve upon it is most welcome. There are obviously better and more efficient ways to go about making it."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/rbnsmathew/simple-quadruped-robot-ebe1fd">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The inspiration for this project came initially from the Casio 92B, which was the recommended calculator for the humanities in Belgium and France. Unfortunately the 92B, except for its elegance, was not very impressive... Having recently discovered the 92+ and its algorithmic mode just after high school, I was happy to see that "the" calculator that had been with me for six years was going to keep me busy for a while! ...The only disappointment was of course that the 92+ has no internal memory. So I thought it would be interesting to create an external, detachable memory module to be able to save those long programs that become a heavy task to rewrite. Although this module can be compatible with any calculator (or any device with a matrix keyboard), it was primarily designed for the Casio FX-92+. Supplies - 1x Arduino Nano - 4x CD4066 Quad Bilateral Switch - 5x push button - 2x 10k ohm resistor"</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Casio-Calculator-External-Memory-Casio-FX92/">[...]</a>

It has been a long time since I want to make a thermal imaging monitorin the epidemic for our office.But the array thermal sensor was once very expensive in 2020, as there are huge demandsin the COVID-19, that I have to pause my plan, and until recently, I have the chance to do this.Of course, it is good to buy one from the market, but the price is expensive, and actually not so good as my design. Open source both on hardware&amp; firmware. Supplies: - The parallel TFT Touch based on ESP32-S2, with resolution 320*240: The reason I use this touch is that: 1.) It has a much higher refresh rate than SPI display, check the comparison video at: https://youtu.be/fXq_TVa0oq4 2.)

Electromagnetic fields are a combination of invisible electric and magnetic fields of force. They are generated by many devices like power lines, kitchen appliances, mobile phones, computers, but they are also generated by natural phenomena like the Earth’s magnetic field. Many such projects can be found on the Internet, but most often the only proof of their sensitivity and functionality is the text in the description of the project itself. So I decided to make two devices, one with discrete elements (transistors) and the other with an Integrated Circuit, and test their features that are shown in the video.
