<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1775, o físico e matemático francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9-Marie_Amp%C3%A8re">André-Marie Ampère</a>. Ele foi um dos fundadores da ciência do electromagnetismo clássico, a que se referiu como "electrodinâmica". É também o inventor de numerosas aplicações, tais como o solenóide (termo por ele cunhado) e o telégrafo eléctrico. Como autodidacta, Ampère foi membro da Academia Francesa de Ciências e professor na Politécnica de École e no Collège de France. A unidade SI de medição de corrente eléctrica, o ampere, tem o seu nome. O seu nome é também um dos 72 nomes inscritos na Torre Eiffel.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1899,o engenheiro japonês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenjiro_Takayanagi">Kenjiro Takayanagi</a>. Ele foi pioneiro no desenvolvimento da televisão. Apesar de não ter obtido muito reconhecimento no Ocidente, construiu o primeiro receptor de televisão totalmente electrónico do mundo, e é referido como "o pai da televisão". Em 1925, Takayanagi iniciou a investigação na televisão após ter lido sobre a nova tecnologia numa revista francesa. Desenvolveu um sistema semelhante ao de John Logie Baird, utilizando um disco Nipkow para digitalizar o sujeito e gerar sinais eléctricos. Mas ao contrário de Baird, Takayanagi deu o importante passo de utilizar um tubo de raios catódicos para exibir o sinal recebido, desenvolvendo assim o primeiro aparelho de televisão "totalmente-electrónico".</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1930, o astronauta norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin">Buzz Aldrin</a>. Ele ficou conhecido por ter estabeleceu um recorde de actividade extra-veicular e foi o segundo homem a pôr os pés na Lua. Como antigo piloto da Força Aérea dos EUA na Coreia, foi um dos terceiros astronautas nomeados pela NASA em Outubro de 1963. Em 11 de Novembro de 1966, foi lançado na Gemini 12 com o piloto de comando James Lovell num voo de 4 dias, durante o qual Aldrin estabeleceu um novo recorde de actividade extra-veicular (5½ horas) fora da nave espacial. Aldrin foi o piloto do módulo lunar da Apollo 11, lançado a 16 de Julho de 1969. Esta foi a primeira missão de aterragem lunar tripulada, e Aldrin foi o segundo homem a pôr os pés na Lua, (seguindo Neil Armstrong) a 20 de Julho de 1969, e passou 2 horas e 15 minutos na superfície lunar.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1931, o físico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lee_(physicist)">David M. Lee</a>. Ele, com Robert C. Richardson e Douglas D. Osheroff, recebeu em 1996 o Prémio Nobel da Física de 1996 pela sua descoberta conjunta em 1972 de superfluidade no raro isótopo hélio-3. Trabalhando no laboratório de baixa temperatura da Universidade de Cornell, construíram os seus próprios aparelhos para reduzir a temperatura para cerca de 0,002K. Este era substancialmente inferior a cerca de 2K, no qual o hélio-4 do isótopo comum se torna um superfluido, como observado por Pjotr Kapitsa no final da década de 1930. Mas He-3 teve de ser reduzido em temperatura para quase zero absoluto antes de se tornar superfluido, e capaz de fluir sem resistência, mesmo para escalar as paredes dos recipientes e fluir para o exterior. Os átomos tinham, até esse ponto, movido com velocidades e direcções aleatórias. Mas como superfluidos, os átomos movimentam-se então de forma coordenada.</p>

<h2><a href="https://news.ti.com/ti-buffer-amplifier-increases-signal-bandwidth-tenfold-in-data-acquisition-systems">TI buffer amplifier increases signal bandwidth tenfold in data-acquisition systems</a></h2>

<p><em>"Test and measurement engineers can save months of design time by eliminating the need for custom ASICs and simplifying front-end designs Texas Instruments (TI) (Nasdaq: TXN) today introduced the industry’s widest-bandwidth high-input-impedance (Hi-Z) buffer amplifier, capable of supporting frequency bandwidths as high as 3 GHz. The wider bandwidth and high slew rates of the BUF802 enable higher signal throughput and minimal input settling time. Designers can leverage this faster throughput to measure higher-frequency signals more accurately in test and measurement applications including oscilloscopes, active probes and high-frequency data-acquisition systems. For more information, see www.ti.com/BUF802-pr. The bandwidth achieved by the BUF802 was previously only possible by using application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that can increase system design time, complexity and cost. By eliminating ASICs, designers who use TI’s buffer can get to market faster while achieving a wide dynamic range at a fraction of the cost."</em> <a href="https://news.ti.com/ti-buffer-amplifier-increases-signal-bandwidth-tenfold-in-data-acquisition-systems">[...]</a>

The major milestone for the Tacoma-based startup was captured in this new video in rural Pierce County, Washington on Sunday, January 9th, 2022 as part of its rigorous test program to achieve FAA airworthiness certification. The uncrewed ZEVA demonstration aircraft completed four flights, totaling more than four minutes of controlled hovering, simulated taxiing maneuvers at slow speeds, and limited vertical climb maneuvers. Its compact airframe is designed for a single pilot and is small enough to fit in a standard automobile parking space. The vehicle is projected to cruise at speeds of up to 160mph with a range of up to 50 miles, optimizing point-to-point travel. “This is a huge inflection point for ZEVA as we join an exclusive set of proven flying eVTOL platforms, and a testament to the relentless hard work and ingenuity of our entire team over the past two and half years,” said Stephen Tibbitts, CEO and Chairman of ZEVA."</em> <a href="https://www.zevaaero.com/2022/01/13/zeva-successfully-completes-historic-first-test-flight/">[...]</a>

Since then, we’ve sold nearly 1.5 million Picos, and thousands of you have used RP2040 in your own electronic projects and products. Since June, RP2040 has been available through our worldwide network of Approved Resellers, for a single-unit price of $1. This remains the best way to get your hands on the chip for prototyping, and for small- to medium-scale production. But as RP2040 products begin to ramp to scale, and the global semiconductor shortage has transmuted most other microcontrollers into unobtainium, we’ve started to see people asking to buy tens of thousands of chips at a time.

A key breakthrough in the quest for DNA’s structure came from X-ray crystallography, a technique that maps the density of electrons in a molecule based on how beams of X-ray radiation diffract through the spaces between atoms in the sample. The diffraction patterns generated by crystallography can then be used to deduce the overall molecular structure. Thanks to a steady stream of advances over the decades, X-ray crystallography is now exponentially more powerful than it was in Crick’s time, and can even reveal the placement of individual atoms.

Atoms and molecules, in turn, are made of elementary particles, interacting via a set of fundamental forces.

They were able to demonstrate a two-qubit gate fidelity of 99.5 percent—higher than the 99 percent considered to be the threshold for building fault-tolerant computers—using electron spin qubits in silicon, which are promising for large-scale quantum computers as the nanofabrication technology for building them already exists. The world is currently in a race to develop large-scale quantum computers that could vastly outperform classical computers in certain areas. However, these efforts have been hindered by a number of factors, including in particular the problem of decoherence, or noise generated in the qubits. This problem becomes more serious with the number of qubits, hampering scaling up. In order to achieve a large-scale computer that could be used for useful applications, it is believed that a two-qubit gate fidelity of at least 99 percent to implement the surface code for error correction is required."</em> <a href="https://www.riken.jp/en/news_pubs/research_news/pr/2022/20220120_1/index.html">[...]</a>

The technology adapts to bear heavy loads, tolerate extreme stress and heat, and reversibly bond to various surfaces including glass, aluminum and steel. “Strong, tough adhesives are difficult to design because they need to incorporate hard and soft features that are not typically compatible,” said ORNL scientist and corresponding author Tomonori Saito. Structural adhesives such as epoxy are largely designed for load-bearing strength but lack toughness, a property that helps materials dissipate stress when pulled or stretched to prevent sudden failure. “The challenge has been to add the toughness you get in flexible materials without sacrificing strength."</em> <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/news/polymer-upcycling-common-plastic-adds-toughness-recyclability-structural-adhesives">[...]</a>

Quach, who is a Ramsay Fellow in the School of Physical Sciences and the Institute for Photonics and Advanced Sensing (IPAS), at the University of Adelaide. “It is theoretically possible that the charging power of quantum batteries increases faster than the size of the battery which could allow new ways to speed charging.” To prove the concept of superabsorption, the team – who published their findings in the journal Science Advances –built several wafer-like microcavities of different sizes which contained different numbers of organic molecules.

<p><em>"By shaking an optical lattice potential, researchers in Cambridge have realized a discontinuous phase transition in a strongly correlated quantum gas, opening the door to quantum simulations of false vacuum decay in the early universe. Phase transitions are everywhere, ranging from water boiling to snowflakes melting, and from magnetic transitions in solids to cosmological phase transitions in the early universe. Particularly intriguing are quantum phase transitions that occur at temperatures close to absolute zero and are driven by quantum rather than thermal fluctuations. Researchers in the University of Cambridge studied properties of quantum phases and their transitions using ultracold atoms in an optical lattice potential (formed by a set of standing wave lasers). Typically, the transition from a Mott insulator (MI) to a superfluid (SF), which is governed by the interplay of the atom-atom interactions and the hopping of atoms, is a continuous transition, where the system undergoes a smooth continuous change crossing the phase transition point. However, many phase transitions are discontinuous, such as water freezing to ice, or the transition thought to have triggered the inflation period in the early universe."</em> <a href="https://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/news/towards-quantum-simulation-false-vacuum-decay">[...]</a>

As you can imagine, this device is meant for camping, away from your home wifi network, LoRa makes more sense instead of wifi connectivity. In this project, I am using Helium network which is the most popular choice these days due to broader network coverage and it's growing rapidly. I am going to use same Edge Impulse model. If you are interested in tinyML part, please checkout my previous project."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/mithun-das/ai-thermal-camera-for-safe-camping-seeed-helium-aws-v2-c0d28b">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A tutorial for people who finally want to debug their Arduino projects that run on AVR MCUs using the GNU project debugger GDB The current Arduino IDE does unfortunately not support debugging. Even the new beta version supports debugging only for ARM MCUs. With a few easy steps, it is nevertheless possible to use avr-gdb in order to debug your Arduino project on many AVR chips. In this article, I will focus on MCUs that support debugWIRE, i.e., the classic ATtinys and the ATmegaX8 family. Introduction The Arduino IDE is very simple and makes it easy to get started. After a while, however, one notes that a lot of important features are missing."</em> <a href="https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5321801/Debugging-an-Arduino-project-with-GDB-on-classic-A">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.glennklockwood.com/electronics/555.html">Understanding the 555 Timer IC</a></h2>

<p><em>"I had a really difficult time understanding exactly what 555 timer circuits do and how they work. Most explanations online refer to their functionality when paired with RC series, but not exactly what logical interactions between the different input pins are. To wrap my head around what was going on, I conducted some experiments much like those I did to understand how BJT transistors work. I used a Raspberry Pi to control the experiments and log the results a TLC555 chip, which came as a part of my Adafruit Parts Pal an MCP41010 digital potentiometer to vary the input voltages on different 555 pins an MCP3008 analog-to-digital converter to read the 555's output voltage pin Given that the 555 timer has four input pins (TRIG, RESET, THRES, and CONT) and one relevant output pin (OUT), the idea is to hold three of the input pins fixed, then vary the fourth with the MCP41010 and measure the effect on the OUT pin with the MCP3008.
