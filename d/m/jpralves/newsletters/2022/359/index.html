<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1834, o engenheiro e fabricante pioneiro de automóveis alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottlieb_Daimler">Gottlieb Daimler</a>. ele inventou o primeiro motor de combustão interna de alta velocidade, operando a até 900 rpm (1883) e um carburador (1885) para misturar gasolina e ar. A mota que construiu em 1885 foi talvez a primeira do mundo. Foi a primeira do mundo quando, com Wilhelm Maybach, construiu um automóvel de quatro rodas em 1886, capaz de atingir uma velocidade de 11 mph. Depois de desenvolver uma caixa de quatro velocidades e uma correia de transmissão para transferir a potência para as rodas, começaram o fabrico. Em 1890 fundou a Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft, que produziu a Mercedes (1889), fundindo-se mais tarde na Daimler-Benz &amp; Co. em 1926. A Zeppelin utilizou motores Daimler para os seus dirigíveis.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1849, o inventor e industrial norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_F._Brush">Charles Francis Brush</a>. Ele concebeu uma lâmpada de arco eléctrico e um gerador que produzia uma tensão variável controlada pela carga e uma corrente constante. Foi adoptada em todos os Estados Unidos e no estrangeiro durante a década de 1880. A luz de arco precedeu a lâmpada incandescente de Edison em uso comercial e era adequada para aplicações onde era necessária uma luz brilhante, tais como luzes de rua e iluminação em edifícios comerciais e públicos. Montou o seu primeiro dínamo no Verão de 1876, resultando numa patente para a sua Melhoria em Máquinas Magnetoeléctricas, emitida a 24 de Abril de 1877 (US No. 189997). Desenvolveu então uma luz de arco que era regulada por uma combinação de meios eléctricos e mecânicos limitados por uma "embreagem anelar". O seu sistema foi utilizado pela California Electric Light Co. para a primeira estação geradora central dos EUA (1879).</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1948, o escritor americano-canadiano de ficção <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gibson">William Gibson</a>. Sendo pioneiro do subgénero de ficção científica conhecido como ciberpunk. Iniciou a sua carreira de escritor no final dos anos 70, os seus primeiros trabalhos foram noir, histórias quase futuras que exploravam os efeitos da tecnologia, cibernética, e redes de computadores nos seres humanos - uma "combinação de baixa vida e alta tecnologia" - e ajudaram a criar uma iconografia para a era da informação antes da ubiquidade da Internet nos anos 90. Gibson cunhou o termo "ciberespaço" para "tecnologia digital generalizada e interligada" no seu conto "Burning Chrome" (1982), e mais tarde popularizou o conceito no seu aclamado romance de estreia Neuromancer (1984). Estas primeiras obras de Gibson's foram creditadas com "renovação" da literatura de ficção científica nos anos 80.</p>

<p>Em 1950 era anunciado por cientistas na Universidade da Califórnia em Berkeley um novo elemento radioactivo, elemento 98, denominado "califórnio". Este é um elemento químico sintético da série actinídea do Grupo IIIb da tabela periódica, isótopo califórnio-245. Os cientistas Stanley G. Thompson, Kenneth Street, Jr., Albert Ghiorso, e Glenn T. Seaborg produziram-no bombardeando o curium-242 (número atómico 96) com hélio-iões no ciclotrão de 60 polegadas. Desde então, foram criados isótopos de vida mais longa, incluindo o califórnio-251 com uma semi-vida de 800 anos, e quantidades de microgramas de compostos tais como o oxicloreto CfOCl, o óxido Cf2O3, e o tricloreto CfCl3. Também o califórnio-252, com uma meia-vida de 2,65-anos, tem aplicações industriais e médicas como uma fonte pontual muito intensa de neutrões. Utilizado como emissor de neutrões e para analisar o teor de enxofre do petróleo e para medir o teor de humidade do solo.</p>

<p>Em 1958, os Estados Unidos lançaram o satélite Vanguard I, do Cabo Canaveral, Florida. O satélite de 1,5 Kg foi o primeiro a ser alimentado por energia solar, levava um transmissor de rádio e orbitava a cada 107,9 minutos. Esta foi a entrada tardia dos E.U.A. na Corrida Espacial, o seu segundo lançamento bem sucedido de satélite, após os dois sucessos soviéticos com os seus satélites Sputnik I (83,6 Kg) lançados a 4 de Outubro de 1957 e Sputnik II (508,3 Kg) lançado a 3 de Novembro de 1957. Para o Vanguard I, os EUA em apenas 2 anos, 6 meses e 8 dias tinham desenvolvido de raiz um veículo de lançamento completo de alto desempenho em três fases, um sistema mundial de rastreio de satélites altamente preciso, uma instalação de lançamento adequada e instrumentação de alcance. O Vanguard I foi lançado durante o Ano Geofísico Internacional, e continua a ser o satélite mais antigo ainda em órbita.</p>

<p><em>"With its recent 21st flight complete, the Red Planet rotorcraft is on its way to setting more records during its second year of operations. NASA has extended flight operations of the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter through September. In the months ahead, history’s first aircraft to operate from the surface of another world will support the Perseverance rover’s upcoming science campaign exploring the ancient river delta of Jezero Crater. Along the way, it will continue testing its own capabilities to support the design of future Mars air vehicles. The announcement comes on the heels of the rotorcraft’s 21st successful flight, the first of at least three needed for the helicopter to cross the northwest portion of a region known as “Séítah” and reach its next staging area. “Less than a year ago we didn’t even know if powered, controlled flight of an aircraft at Mars was possible,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, the associate administrator of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasa-extends-ingenuity-helicopter-mission">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4431.html">STMicroelectronics adds space-saving, 20MHz, low-offset op amp in high-performance 5V family</a></h2>

<p><em>"The STMicroelectronics TSV772 dual operational amplifier (op amp) combines high accuracy, low power consumption, and the option of an extremely small 2.0mm x 2.0mm DFN8 package. Extending ST’s high-performance 5V op-amp family, the TSV772 has rail-to-rail inputs and outputs, 20MHz gain-bandwidth (GBW), and is unity-gain stable. With a slew rate of 13V/µs, 7nV/√Hz input noise density, and 4kV ESD capability (HBM), the TSV772 is a strong all-round performer. The maximum input-offset voltage of 200µV (at 25°C) ensures accurate handling of low-amplitude signals. The inherent accuracy also saves using expensive, precision external resistors and helps avoid trimming or calibrating circuits in production. The TSV772 is characterized for an output capacitance of 47pF, simplifying use as an A/D converter input buffer."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4431.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Part of an ongoing project to grow the capacity of the Deep Space Network, which acts as a kind of interplanetary switchboard, the new antenna is the network’s 14th. There’s a powerful new member of NASA’s family of giant antennas that enable engineers and scientists on Earth to communicate with the growing number of spacecraft exploring our solar system. Called Deep Space Station 53, or DSS-53, the 111-foot (34-meter) antenna is part of NASA’s Deep Space Network (DSN). It’s now operational at the network’s facility outside Madrid, one of three such ground stations around the globe. The Madrid station is managed on NASA’s behalf by Spain’s Instituto Nacional de Técnica Aeroespacial (National Institute of Aerospace Technology). To mark the antenna’s debut, King Felipe VI of Spain attended the March 16 inauguration ceremony alongside NASA officials and dignitaries from Spain and the U.S. “NASA is honored and humbled to have the king acknowledge this important milestone by joining us at the Madrid station."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasa-adds-giant-new-dish-to-communicate-with-deep-space-missions">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://news.microsoft.com/innovation-stories/azure-quantum-majorana-topological-qubit/">In a historic milestone, Azure Quantum demonstrates formerly elusive physics needed to build scalable topological qubits</a></h2>

<p><em>"Microsoft’s Azure Quantum program has developed devices that can create quantum properties which scientists have imagined for nearly a century but have not been able to unambiguously produce in the real world — until now. It’s a key scientific breakthrough that demonstrates the elusive building blocks for a topological quantum bit, or qubit, which Microsoft has long pursued as the most promising path to developing a scalable quantum computer that will launch a new generation of as-yet-unimagined computing capabilities for Azure customers. “What’s amazing is humans have been able to engineer a system to demonstrate one of the most exotic pieces of physics in the universe. And we expect to capitalize on this to do the almost unthinkable — to push towards a fault-tolerant quantum machine that will enable computation on an entirely new level that’s closer to the way nature operates,” said Krysta Svore, a Microsoft distinguished engineer who leads the company’s quantum software program. “It’s never been done before, and until now it was never certain that it could be done. And now it’s like yes, here’s this ultimate validation that we’re on the right path,” she said."</em> <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/innovation-stories/azure-quantum-majorana-topological-qubit/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.space.com/nasa-opening-apollo-17-moon-rock-samples-for-artemis">NASA is cracking open a 50-year-old Apollo 17 moon rock sample for Artemis prep</a></h2>

<p><em>"Nearly 50 years after Apollo 17 astronauts collected rocks from the lunar surface, NASA is finally tapping their samples as it prepares for new missions to the moon. NASA set aside the Apollo 17 moon rock samples to preserve the precious samples collected in 1972 by astronauts Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt (also a geologist) collected in the Taurus-Littrow Valley within Mare Serenitatis. The agency knew that science advances in the coming decades would mean there would be techniques available to study the rocks that were not available to scientists of the 1970s. With NASA's Artemis program hoping to send astronauts to the moon in 2025 (the date may be delayed to at least 2026), officials determined now would be a good time to examine a sample from Apollo 17, the last human mission on the moon to date. "The agency knew science and technology would evolve and allow scientists to study the material in new ways to address new questions in the future," Lori Glaze, NASA's director of the planetary science division, said in an agency statement March 4. Scientists unsealed the sample, dubbed the Apollo Next Generation Sample Analysis Program (ANGSA) 73001, at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/nasa-opening-apollo-17-moon-rock-samples-for-artemis">[...]</a>

<p><em>"When we think of ions, we usually think of single atoms that have lost or gained some electrons, but entire molecules can also become ions. In a new publication that was highlighted as an Editor’s Suggestion in Physical Review Letters this week, physicists from the University of Amsterdam, QuSoft and Stony Brook University, show that cold molecular ions can be created using a new method, and that they are a very useful tool for detecting small amounts of other, regular molecules. Trapped ions An ion is an atom or molecule with a surplus or shortage of electrons. Being charged particles, ions can be ‘trapped’ by electromagnetic fields: it is easy to keep them in a fixed position. Trapped ions constitute a promising platform for quantum computation. The reason for this is that they can be stored for a long time, and that modern lasers allow physicists to control single ions very precisely."</em> <a href="https://www.uva.nl/en/shared-content/subsites/institute-of-physics/en/news/2022/03/using-ions-to-find-molecules.html">[...]</a>

The new method can produce multifunctional materials with complex hierarchical structures, such as the xero-, cryo-, and aerogel of magnetite. Thanks to this approach, it is possible to control the composition of the resulting porous materials through the relation of their compounds’ concentrations. One of the method’s most promising applications is biomedicine – the new aerogel can be used to stop bleeding and xerogel can serve as a repository for drug transportation. About the research project Magnetic gels can serve many different properties because of their variety – for instance, in biomedicine they are the base of biosensors and in chemistry they serve as catalysts.

Solar power is expected to reach 10 percent of global power generation by the year 2030, and much of that is likely to be located in desert areas, where sunlight is abundant. But the accumulation of dust on solar panels or mirrors is already a significant issue — it can reduce the output of photovoltaic panels by as much as 30 percent in just one month — so regular cleaning is essential for such installations. But cleaning solar panels currently is estimated to use about 10 billion gallons of water per year — enough to supply drinking water for up to 2 million people. Attempts at waterless cleaning are labor intensive and tend to cause irreversible scratching of the surfaces, which also reduces efficiency. Now, a team of researchers at MIT has devised a way of automatically cleaning solar panels, or the mirrors of solar thermal plants, in a waterless, no-contact system that could significantly reduce the dust problem, they say."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/solar-panels-dust-magnets-0311">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scientists from the NTU Singapore and the Korea Institute of Machinery &amp; Materials (KIMM) have developed a technique to create a highly uniform and scalable semiconductor wafer, paving the way to higher chip yield and more cost-efficient semiconductors. Semiconductor chips commonly found in smart phones and computers are difficult and complex to make, requiring highly advanced machines and special environments to manufacture. Their fabrication is typically done on silicon wafers and then diced into the small chips that are used in devices. However, the process is imperfect and not all chips from the same wafer work or operate as desired. These defective chips are discarded, lowering semiconductor yield while increasing production cost. The ability to produce uniform wafers at the desired thickness is the most important factor in ensuring that every chip fabricated on the same wafer performs correctly."</em> <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/news/detail/new-technique-opens-door-to-cheaper-semiconductors-higher-chip-yield">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This interesting story reflects an important mathematical idea, isomorphism. A difficult problem can be transformed to an isomorphic one, which is mathematical equivalent and easy to solve. A line of 9 numbers corresponds to a 3 x 3 grids; the sum target of fifteen corresponds to one of the rows, columns, and diagonals; Lo Shu pattern corresponds to magic square of order 3. This is what this book intents to tell: programming is isomorphic to mathematics. Just like in art and music, there are interesting stories and mathematicians behind the great minds. There is another further idea in this story: under the surface of the problem hides the theoretical essence, which is abstract and need to understand."</em> <a href="https://github.com/liuxinyu95/unplugged/files/6754569/unplugged-en.pdf">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Driving a low current 3 phase brushless Sensorless DC motor is very easy with this project. This Full-wave BLDC driver project is capable to drive low current brushless fan motor without a hall sensor. 180° sinusoidal drive, high torque output, and silent drive are a few key features of the project. Due to their adaptive features and wide power-supply range capabilities (3 to 12V) they are intended to cover a wide range of motor characteristics while requiring no external tuning from the user. Speed control can be achieved through either power supply modulation or pulse-width-modulation (using the PWM digital input pin5 of CN1). Due to the compact packaging and minimum bill-of-material (power transistors incorporated, no Hall sensor, no external tuning), the project is best suited for low-cost fan applications requiring high efficiency and low acoustic noise, such as CPU cooling fans."</em> <a href="https://www.electronics-lab.com/project/3-phase-brushless-dc-sinusoidal-sensorless-fan-motor-driver/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The project presented here is an SPI programable Gain Amplifier using MAX9939. The MAX9939 is a general-purpose, differential-input programmable-gain amplifier (PGA) that is ideal for conditioning a variety of wide dynamic range signals such as those found in motor current-sense, medical instrumentation, and sonar data acquisition applications. It features SPI-programmable differential gains from 0.2V/V to 157V/V, input offset-voltage compensation, and an output amplifier that can be configured either as a high-order active filter or to provide a differential output. The PGA is optimized for high-signal bandwidth and its gain can be programmed to be 0.2V/V, 1V/V, 10V/V, 20V/V, 30V/V, 40V/V, 60V/V, 80V/V, 119V/V, and 157V/V. Precision resistor matching provides extremely low gain tempco and high CMRR. Although the MAX9939 operates from a single supply VCC between 2.9V to 5.5V, it can process signals both above and below ground due to the use of an input level-shifting amplifier stage."</em> <a href="https://www.electronics-lab.com/project/spi-programmable-gain-amplifier-with-input-vos-trim-and-output-opamp/">[...]</a>

Be warned: there are many “vintage styled” modern phones with a pile of modern electronics inside. This is not one of those – this is a genuine original phone. You can easily tell if you get inside it – the electronics definitely look like something from the 70s and 80s. On getting it home, I discovered that this one had been properly converted to be (still) usable on the UK phone system, so rather than my original plan of gutting it and adding an Arduino (like the majority of tutorials and projects you’ll find on the Internet), I wanted to find a way to use it without changing any of the circuitry or wiring inside.

<p><em>"Modern model railroads are digitally controlled using a Digital Command Control (DCC) protocol similar to network packets. These data packets contain device address and instruction set that is embedded in the form of AC voltage and fed to train track to control locomotives. The great advantage of DCC over analog DC control is that you can independently control the speed and direction of many locomotives on the same train track as well as control many other lights and accessories using that same signal and voltage. Commercial DCC decoders are available on the market however their cost can add up pretty quickly if you have a lot of devices to control. Luckily you can build a simple Arduino DCC decoder yourself to decode DCC signal and control up to 17 LEDs / accessories per each DCC decoder. The DCC signal is an alternating voltage (AC) usually 16V, depending on your DCC controller."</em> <a href="http://electronics-diy.com/electronic_schematic.php?id=1390">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/abaffa/zx81">ZX80/81 Project</a></h2>

<p><em>"Recreation of a Sinclair ZX81 (dual rom 80/81) based on Grant Searle's project. The Sinclair ZX81 was my first computer, I learned how to program (in basic) using this machine in late 80's. It's a master piece of simplicity and ingenuity. Of course, the ZX Spectrum brought colors and sounds but even the ZX81 had expansions like Chroma and Zonx. I believe that every hobbyist who would like to learn how to develop their own projects should start by studying this machine as it presents a simple and easy way to understand a computer architecture. ... and... yes... that's exactly what I did :) I started designing retro computers in January 2021."</em> <a href="https://github.com/abaffa/zx81">[...]</a>
