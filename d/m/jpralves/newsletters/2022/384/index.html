<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1588, o matemático francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marin_Mersenne">Marin Mersenne</a>. Ele foi responsável pela descoberta dos números Mersenne, que é considerada como tendo sido um esforço pioneiro para obter uma fórmula que representasse todos os números primos. Apesar de ter falhado nesta tarefa, o seu trabalho sobre números da forma (2 p - 1), onde p é primordial, tem sido de interesse contínuo na investigação de grandes primos. Embora os números Mersenne representem apenas alguns primos, a sua fórmula inspirou grandes avanços na teoria dos números. Prosseguiu alguns dos trabalhos de acústica de Galileu e estimulou algumas das descobertas posteriores do próprio Galileu. Foi através dele que o trabalho de Galileu se tornou conhecido fora de Itália. Mersenne propôs o uso do pêndulo como dispositivo de cronometragem a Huygens, que o utilizou pela primeira vez num relógio.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1848, o químico orgânico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Meyer">Viktor Meyer</a>. Ele contribuiu grandemente para o conhecimento da química orgânica e inorgânica e inventou um aparelho para determinar as densidades de vapor (e portanto os pesos moleculares), agora com o seu nome. Em 1871, Meyer provou experimentalmente a hipótese de Avogadro ao medir as densidades de vapor de substâncias voláteis (peso molecular, ou massa molecular relativa, é o dobro da densidade de vapor). Ele passou a determinar as densidades de vapor de substâncias inorgânicas a altas temperaturas. Do benzeno obtido do petróleo, Meyer em 1883 isolou o tiofeno, um composto heterocíclico contendo enxofre, que muito mais tarde se tornaria um importante componente de várias drogas sintéticas.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1857, a Fisiologista norte-americana <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ida_Henrietta_Hyde">Ida Henrietta Hyde</a>. Ela inventou o micro-electrodo na década de 1930. Este pequeno dispositivo estimula uma célula viva, quer química quer electricamente, e regista a actividade eléctrica dentro da célula. Os seus primeiros passos incluem ser a primeira mulher a formar-se na Universidade de Heidelberg (1896), a fazer investigação na Faculdade de Medicina de Harvard (no Departamento de Fisiologia) e a ser eleita para a Sociedade Americana de Fisiologia. Diz-se que o micro-electrodo revolucionou a neuro-fisiologia. Ela pesquisou o movimento cardíaco animal, circulação, respiração, e sistemas nervosos. Investigou o mecanismo respiratório do caranguejo-ferradura e do gafanhoto, e o centro respiratório do skate, anfíbios e mamíferos.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1918, o químico inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Barton">Derek Barton</a>. Ele recebeu em conjunto com o norueguês Odd Hassel o Prémio Nobel da Química de 1969 pela investigação que ajudou a estabelecer a análise conformacional (o estudo da estrutura geométrica tridimensional de moléculas complexas). Num breve artigo na Experienta intitulado "The Conformation of the Steroid Nucleus" (1950), Barton mostrou que às moléculas orgânicas em geral e às moléculas de esteróides em particular poderia ser atribuída uma conformação preferida baseada no trabalho de físicos químicos, em particular por Odd Hassel. A análise conformacional é útil na elucidação da configuração, no planeamento da síntese orgânica, e na análise dos mecanismos de reacção. É fundamental para uma compreensão completa dos processos enzimáticos.</p>

<p><em>"The cycle of star formation is on display in this nearby nebula. Webb’s MIRI instrument captures protostars nestled deep in clouds of gas and dust, still gathering mass. Once upon a space-time, a cosmic creation story unfolded: thousands of never-before-seen young stars spotted in a stellar nursery called 30 Doradus, captured by NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope. Nicknamed the Tarantula Nebula for the appearance of its dusty filaments in previous telescope images, the nebula has long been a favorite for astronomers studying star formation. In addition to young stars, Webb reveals distant background galaxies, as well as the detailed structure and composition of the nebula’s gas and dust. At only 161,000 light-years away in the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy, the Tarantula Nebula is the largest and brightest star-forming region in the Local Group, the galaxies nearest our Milky Way."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/a-cosmic-tarantula-caught-by-nasas-webb">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Device opens the door to applications in optical communications, sensing, and the search for exoplanets. On-chip laser frequency combs — lasers that emit multiple frequencies or colors of light simultaneously separated like the tooth on a comb — are a promising technology for a range of applications including environmental monitoring, optical computing, astronomy, and metrology. However, on-chip frequency combs are still limited by one serious problem — they are not always efficient. There are several ways to mitigate the efficiency problem, but they all suffer from trade-offs. For example, combs can either have high efficiency or broad bandwidth but not both. The inability to design an on-chip laser frequency comb that is both efficient and broad has stymied researchers for years and hindered the widespread commercialization of these devices."</em> <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2022/09/new-chip-frequency-comb-100x-more-efficient">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.udel.edu/udaily/2022/september/ocean-acoustics-underwater-electrical-engineering/">UD engineers harness the power of artificial intelligence and acoustic engineering to explore underwater worlds</a></h2>

<p><em>"About 125 miles off the New England coast, a small group of researchers from the University of Delaware’s College of Engineering are harnessing the power of underwater acoustics, big data and machine learning to better understand what lies deep beneath the surface. Just as marine mammals like bottle-nose dolphins use echolocation to emit pulses of sound to detect objects underwater, so too are these researchers relying on the phenomenon of sound waves and how they reverberate to understand what they cannot see. By using acoustic technologies that can transmit signals and information in a complex aquatic environment, engineers can study the ocean at a much larger scale and finer details than currently possible. “This remote sensing is similar to using ultrasound for exploring the inside of the human body, except here we use different sound frequencies and we aim to study inside the ocean environment,” said Mohsen Badiey, an acoustic oceanographer and electrical engineering professor. “Now, say we can modernize that process. The research we’re doing is remote sensing of the properties of the environment from within the water column.” The team, led by Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering’s Badiey and Lin Wan, an assistant professor, is measuring underwater sound in order to determine the composition and the physical properties of the ocean environment."</em> <a href="https://www.udel.edu/udaily/2022/september/ocean-acoustics-underwater-electrical-engineering/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Advances in physics, medicine, and security enabled by major expansion to one of the world’s most powerful lasers. Researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) have completed a major expansion of one of the world’s most powerful laser systems, creating new opportunities in accelerator research for the future of high-energy physics and other fields. The expansion created a second beamline for the petawatt laser at the Berkeley Lab Laser Accelerator (BELLA) Center, enabling the development of next-generation particle accelerators for applications in science, medicine, security, and industry. The second beamline came online this summer and is the culmination of several years of planning, design, and engineering by the BELLA and engineering teams. “We are happy to see construction completed and are very eager to begin the wide variety of exciting experiments that are enabled by the second beamline,” said Eric Esarey, Director of the BELLA Center. Using light to move particles Traditional accelerators use radio-frequency electromagnetic fields to gradually speed particles up over distances of tens of kilometers and tend to be huge and very expensive as a result."</em> <a href="https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2022/09/07/next-generation-particle-accelerators/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://news.itmo.ru/en/science/new_materials/news/12793/">ITMO Researchers Suggest All-Optical Data Processing Method Using Heating</a></h2>

<p><em>"Metal-organiс frameworks (MOFs) are a new class of compounds that is famous for its unique properties. They have been considered a functional material for gas adsorption, industrial membranes, and catalysts; however, researchers from ITMO have gone further and decided to zone in on MOFs’ optical properties.

<p><em>"Assistant Professor Ariel Furst and her colleagues are looking to DNA to help guide the process. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a major contributor to climate change and a significant product of many human activities, notably industrial manufacturing. A major goal in the energy field has been to chemically convert emitted CO2 into valuable chemicals or fuels. But while CO2 is available in abundance, it has not yet been widely used to generate value-added products. Why not? The reason is that CO2 molecules are highly stable and therefore not prone to being chemically converted to a different form."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/turning-carbon-dioxide-valuable-products-0907">[...]</a>

The camera could be useful for a variety of applications such as industrial part inspection, gesture recognition and collecting data for 3D display systems. “We consider our camera lensless because it replaces the bulk lenses used in conventional cameras with a thin, lightweight microlens array made of flexible polymer,” said research team leader Weijian Yang from the University of California, Davis. “Because each microlens can observe objects from different viewing angles, it can accomplish complex imaging tasks such as acquiring 3D information from objects partially obscured by objects closer to the camera.” In the Optica Publishing Group journal Optics Express, Yang and first author Feng Tian, a doctoral student in Yang’s lab, describe the new 3D camera. Because the camera learns from existing data how to digitally reconstruct a 3D scene, it can produce 3D images in real time. “This 3D camera could be used to give robots 3D vision, which could help them navigate 3D space or enable complex tasks such as manipulation of fine objects,” said Yang."</em> <a href="https://www.optica.org/en-us/about/newsroom/news_releases/2022/september/lensless_camera_creates_3d_images_from_single_expo/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Engineering researchers have created new high-power electronic devices that are more energy efficient than previous technologies. The devices are made possible by a unique technique for “doping” gallium nitride (GaN) in a controlled way. “Many technologies require power conversion – where power is switched from one format to another,” says Dolar Khachariya, the first author of a paper on the work and a former Ph.D. student at North Carolina State University. “For example, the technology might need to convert AC to DC, or convert electricity into work – like an electric motor. And in any power conversion system, most power loss takes place at the power switch – which is an active component of the electrical circuit that makes the power conversion system. “Developing more efficient power electronics like power switches reduces the amount of power lost during the conversion process,” says Khachariya, who is who is now a researcher at Adroit Materials Inc. “This is particularly important for developing technologies to support a more sustainable power infrastructure, such as smart grids.” “Our work here not only means that we can reduce energy loss in power electronics, but we can also make the systems for power conversion more compact compared to conventional silicon and silicon carbide electronics,” says Ramón Collazo, co-author of the paper and an associate professor of materials science and engineering at NC State."</em> <a href="https://news.ncsu.edu/2022/09/new-gallium-nitride-devices/">[...]</a>

The direction one magnon spins can influence that of its neighbor, which affects the spin of its neighbor, and so on, yielding what are known as spin waves.

<p><em>"This project is a simple StopWatch for measuring times on different processes or activities. The project was chosen to test some 4-layers PCBs and experiment with the XLP (Extreme Low-Power Technology) of the PIC18LF14k50. You can measure from milliseconds up to 99h. The PCB does not have any power button, since the project's approach is to use the XLP technology of the PIC. It only has two buttons: the start/mode button and the pause/stop button. Supplies: - 1x PCB - 1x PIC18LF14K50 - 1x Green LED (0805 metrics) - 11x NPN 600mA - 10x 220 Ohm resistor (0805 metrics) - 1x 100 Ohm resistor (0805 metrics) - 11x 4K7 Ohm resistor (0805 metrics) - 6x 10K Ohm resistor (0805 metrics) - 1x Buzzer 5V - 3x 0.1uF Capacitor (0805 metrics) - 1x CR2032 Battery Holder - 1x 4-Display 8 digits (3461AS) - 2x Tactile Push Buttons - 2x ZLLS410TA diode - 1x Inverter IC (74LVC1G06GW,125)"</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/StopWatch/">[...]</a>
