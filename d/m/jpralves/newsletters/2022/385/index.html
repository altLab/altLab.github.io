<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1852, o inventor guiano-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Ernst_Matzeliger">Jan Ernest Matzeliger</a>. Ele ficou conhecido pela sua máquina de calçado que revolucionou a indústria do calçado ao substituir o trabalho manual de prender a sola à parte superior de um sapato. Deixou a sua terra natal da Guiana holandesa e partiu para a América aos 19 anos de idade. Instalou-se em Lynn, Massachussetts, por volta dos 25 anos de idade, onde se tornou operador de máquinas de coser sapatos. Lá viu o tedioso e lento processo de acabamento do sapato à mão, e resolveu desenvolver uma máquina capaz de fazer esse trabalho de forma mais eficiente. Apesar de ser tão pobre que a obtenção de materiais era difícil, ele fez um modelo de madeira. Obteve uma patente para a sua invenção, emitida a 20 de Março de 1883. Com melhorias, em 1885, tinha um modelo de produção pronto, capaz de produzir sapatos muito mais rapidamente do que os trabalhadores manuais.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1881, o construtor italiano de automóveis de corrida e de luxo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ettore_Bugatti">Ettore Bugatti</a>. Ele depois de estabelecer uma fábrica em Molsheim, Alsácia, em 1909, produziu um veículo de baixa potência de grande sucesso para o Le Mans. O mais meticulosamente construído dos seus carros. o Tipo 41, "Golden Bugatti" ou "La Royale" era um dos carros mais caros, dos quais apenas seis a oito foram alguma vez fabricados.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1886, o engenheiro de minas e matemático francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_L%C3%A9vy_(mathematician)">Paul Lévy</a>. Ele contribuiu para a probabilidade, análise funcional, equações diferenciais parciais e séries. Estudou também geometria. Em 1926 alargou a Laplace a classes funcionais mais amplas. Realizou um trabalho em larga escala sobre equações diferenciais generalizadas em derivadas funcionais.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1929, o físico teórico americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Gell-Mann">Murray Gell-Mann</a>. Ele previu a existência de quarks. Foi galardoado com o Prémio Nobel da Física de 1969 pelas suas contribuições para a Física de Partículas. A sua primeira grande contribuição para a física de alta energia foi feita em 1953, quando demonstrou como algumas características intrigantes dos hadrons (partículas que respondem à força forte) podiam ser explicadas por um novo número quântico, que ele chamou de "estranheza". Em 1964, ele (e Yuval Ne'eman) propôs a forma octogonal de definir a estrutura das partículas. Isto levou ao postulado de Gell-Mann sobre o quark, um nome que ele cunhou (de uma palavra em "O Despertar de Finnegan" de James Joyce).</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1932, o químico inglês-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Bartlett_(chemist)">Neil Bartlett</a>. Ele formou o primeiro composto com um elemento gasoso nobre, o xénon platinofluoreto, XePtF6 (23 Mar 1962), um sólido cristalino amarelo alaranjado, estável à temperatura ambiente através da imersão do flúor de platina no gás xenon. Durante meio século desde que Ramsay descobriu o xénon, este tinha, com os outros elementos do seu grupo na Tabela Periódica, sido conhecido como um gás inerte. Após a descoberta de Bartlett, foi aberto um novo campo de investigação, e outros químicos encontraram outros compostos não só de xénon, mas também os elementos de gás nobre radão e krypton. Os elementos mais pesados dos gases nobres, como os menos inertes, eram susceptíveis de combinação com um elemento altamente reactivo.</p>

<p>E nesta semana que passou foi lançada a versão final do Arduino IDE 2.0. Esta versão tem um editor moderno e proporciona uma melhor experiência global ao utilizador graças a uma interface reactiva e a um tempo de compilação mais rápido. O Serial Monitor e Plotter podem ser utilizados em conjunto, permitindo aos utilizadores ter dois viewports na sua saída de dados. Antes tinha de escolher entre texto e gráficos, enquanto que agora pode ter ambos.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker e alguns vídeos interessantes. É apresentado o livro "The Official Raspberry Pi Handbook 2023".</p>

<p><em>"The latest findings provide greater detail on a region of the Red Planet that has a watery past and is yielding promising samples for the NASA-ESA Mars Sample Return campaign. NASA’s Perseverance rover is well into its second science campaign, collecting rock-core samples from features within an area long considered by scientists to be a top prospect for finding signs of ancient microbial life on Mars. The rover has collected four samples from an ancient river delta in the Red Planet’s Jezero Crater since July 7, bringing the total count of scientifically compelling rock samples to 12. “We picked the Jezero Crater for Perseverance to explore because we thought it had the best chance of providing scientifically excellent samples – and now we know we sent the rover to the right location,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA’s associate administrator for science in Washington. “These first two science campaigns have yielded an amazing diversity of samples to bring back to Earth by the Mars Sample Return campaign.” Twenty-eight miles (45 kilometers) wide, Jezero Crater hosts a delta – an ancient fan-shaped feature that formed about 3.5 billion years ago at the convergence of a Martian river and a lake. Perseverance is currently investigating the delta’s sedimentary rocks, formed when particles of various sizes settled in the once-watery environment."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-perseverance-rover-investigates-geologically-rich-mars-terrain">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4480.html">STMicroelectronics reveals advanced VDA-compliant LIN alternator regulator, raising performance and flexibility of 12V car systems</a></h2>

<p><em>"STMicroelectronics has introduced the L9918 automotive alternator regulator, with enhanced features to ensure the stability of 12V vehicle electrical systems. The regulator contains a MOSFET to deliver alternator excitation current and a freewheeling diode to handle the rotor current when excitation is turned off. Closed-loop operation with load response control (LRC) and return LRC maintains a consistent voltage as the vehicle’s overall power demand changes continuously. The excitation MOSFET can deliver up to 13A to the coil, which is more than typical alternative regulators can provide and thus improves response to fluctuating demands. In addition, using the latest manufacturing process technology, the MOSFET has superior RDS(on) and so minimizes power dissipation while boosting efficiency. With integrated nonvolatile memory (NVM), the L9918 allows customers to program parameters including the voltage set point and alternator characteristics."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4480.html">[...]</a>

Scientists at Sandia National Laboratories and the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light have reported on a device that could replace a roomful of equipment to link photons in a bizarre quantum effect called entanglement. This device -- a kind of nano-engineered material called a metasurface -- paves the way for entangling photons in complex ways that have not been possible with compact technologies. When scientists say photons are entangled, they mean they are linked in such a way that actions on one affect the other, no matter where or how far apart the photons are in the universe. It is an effect of quantum mechanics, the laws of physics that govern particles and other very tiny things. Although the phenomenon might seem odd, scientists have harnessed it to process information in new ways."</em> <a href="https://newsreleases.sandia.gov/quantum_metasurface/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"For the first time, scientists at the University of Oxford have been able to demonstrate a network of two entangled optical atomic clocks and show how the entanglement between the remote clocks can be used to improve their measurement precision, according to research published this week by Nature. Improving the precision of frequency comparisons between multiple atomic clocks offers the potential to unlock our understanding of all sorts of natural phenomena. It is essential, for example, in measuring the space-time variation of fundamental constants, for geodesy where the frequency of the atomic clocks is used to measure the heights of two locations, and even in the search for dark matter. Fundamental limit of precision Entanglement – a quantum phenomenon in which two or more particles become linked together so that they can no longer be described independently, even at vast distances – is the key to reaching the fundamental limit of precision that’s determined by quantum theory. While previous experiments have demonstrated that entanglement between clocks in the same system can be used to improve the quality of measurements, this is the first time researchers have been able to achieve this between clocks in two separate remotely entangled systems. This development paves the way for applications like those mentioned above, where comparing the frequencies of atoms in separate locations to the highest possible precision is vital."</em> <a href="https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/news/quantum-network-entangled-atomic-clocks">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A new study describes the rules by which physical force on cells affects squishy biocomputers inside, and the action of a related kinase known to be overactive as tau tangles form in the brain cells of Alzheimer's patients. An emerging field explores how groups of molecules condense together inside cells, the way oil droplets assemble and separate from water in a vinaigrette. In human cells, "liquid-liquid phase separation" occurs because similar, large molecules glom together into dense droplets separated from the more diluted parts of the fluid cell interior. Past work had suggested that evolution harnessed the natural formation of these "condensates" to organize cells, providing, for instance, isolated spaces for the building of cellular machines. Furthermore, abnormal, condensed -- also called "tangled" -- groups of molecules in droplets are nearly always present in the cells of patients with neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's disease. While no one knows why such condensates form, one new theory argues that the biophysical properties of cell interiors change as people age -- driven in part by "molecular crowding" that packs more molecules into the same spaces to affect phase separation."</em> <a href="https://nyulangone.org/news/dense-liquid-droplets-act-cellular-computers">[...]</a>

That is the finding described by a team of roboticists, physicists and biologists in the Sept. 5 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, in a paper titled “Walking is like slithering: a unifying, data-driven view of locomotion.” “This is important because it will allow roboticists to build much simpler models to describe the way robots walk and move through the world,” said paper coauthor Nick Gravish, a faculty member in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the University of California San Diego. The researchers had previously studied ant walking and wanted to see how their findings could be applied to robots. In the process, they discovered a new mathematical relationship between walking, skipping, slithering and swimming in viscous fluids for multi-legged animals and bots. The team studied several colonies of Argentine ants at UC San Diego, and two different types of multi-legged robots at the University of Michigan. “Argentine ants are very easy to study in the lab,” said paper coauthor Glenna Clifton, a faculty member at the University of Portland, who conducted most of the ant research while she was a postdoctoral scholar in Gravish’s lab at UC San Diego."</em> <a href="https://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/PNAS_ants_2022">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A lightweight, reliable, and completely portable ultraviolet (UV) radiation meter. Ever since suffering severe chemical burns, I could not expose myself to sunlight and ultraviolet radiation. Knowing how to deal with sunlight is an essential skill for anyone in similar situations, so I designed this portable UV meter and donated a dozen units to patients of the burn center in which I was hospitalized. Still, I believe this can help anyone (burn victim or not) to deal with ultraviolet radiation exposure since it can have significant negative health effects, such as early aging of the skin and damage that can lead to skin cancer. Therefore, it is crucial to be able to measure your exposure to UV in your daily life, especially in places you spend a lot of time, such as your home, workplace, school, etc -- UV radiation is present in places you would never expect. It is also important to know the intensity of UV radiation so you can take the proper measures to protect yourself."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/d4visl/portable-and-rechargeable-ultraviolet-uv-radiation-meter-751c2e">[...]</a>

The problem Sometimes, in the development of our work, we need to monitor some physical variable of a process, and either because measuring it directly is not safe or we simply do not have the corresponding sensor to do it, we are limited to sampling it. In some cases in this process, there are other variables that are indirectly correlated with the one that we cannot measure, which we do have the possibility of monitoring. As a proof of concept to this case, I show you how I determine the air quality based on how an air purifier vibrates while cleaning impurities and gases in the environment automatically. For this, I trained a neural network putting the purifier in its 3 speeds and capturing its vibrations in each case, when the purifier is configured in automatic mode, it selects one of its speeds depending on how much the environment has to be cleaned, hence the relationship between air quality and the characteristic vibrations of each speed."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/mcmchris/measuring-air-quality-with-an-accelerometer-76e3bb">[...]</a>
