<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1759, o engenheiro e economista escocês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Playfair">William Playfair</a>. Ele foi pioneiro na representação gráfica de estatísticas, criando o gráfico de linhas, gráfico de barras e gráfico de tartes, embora o seu nome seja pouco conhecido. As suas invenções e patentes incluíam máquinas metalúrgicas, a produção em massa de colheres prateadas, melhoramentos em alfaias agrícolas, e modificação dos arcos para os navios para aumentar a velocidade. Ganhou experiência como aprendiz de Andrew Meikle (inventor da debulhadora) e trabalhando com James Watt e Matthew Boulton (fabricantes de motores a vapor). O livro Playfair Commercial and Political Atlas (1786), que introduziu os seus métodos de exposição gráfica, foi o primeiro grande trabalho a utilizar gráficos estatísticos.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1791, o físico e químico inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday">Michael Faraday</a>. Ele ficou conhecido pelas muitas experiências que contribuíram grandemente para a compreensão do electromagnetismo. Embora fosse um dos maiores experimentalistas, era em grande parte autodidacta. Nomeado por Sir Humphry Davy como seu assistente na Instituição Real, Faraday concentrou-se inicialmente na química analítica, e descobriu o benzeno em 1825. O seu trabalho mais importante foi no campo do electromagnetismo, no qual demonstrou rotação electromagnética e descobriu indução electromagnética (a chave para o desenvolvimento do dínamo eléctrico e do motor). Descobriu também o diamagnetismo e as leis da electrólise. Publicou artigos pioneiros que levaram ao uso prático da electricidade, e defendeu o uso da luz eléctrica em faróis. A unidade que mede a capacitância é o Farad (F) em homenagem a Faraday.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1959, o astrofísico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Perlmutter">Saul Perlmutter</a>. Ele partilhou (com Brian P. Schmidt e Adam G. Riess) o Prémio Nobel da Física 2011 pela "descoberta da expansão acelerada do Universo através de observações de supernovas distantes". Para este efeito, tinha sido co-fundador (1988) e liderou o Projecto Internacional Supernova Cosmology baseado no Laboratório Nacional Lawrence Berkeley.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker e alguns vídeos interessantes. É apresentada a revistar HackSpace Magazine nº 59 de Outubro e os livros "Elements of Programming" e "FreeCAD for Makers".</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.global.toshiba/ww/technology/corporate/rdc/rd/topics/22/2209-01.html">Toshiba’s Double-Transmon Coupler Will Realize Faster, More Accurate Superconducting Quantum Computers</a></h2>

<p><em>"Researchers at Toshiba Corporation (TOKYO: 6502) have achieved a breakthrough in quantum computer architecture: the basic design for a double-transmon coupler that will improve the speed and accuracy of quantum computation in tunable couplers. The coupler is a key device in determining the performance of superconducting quantum computers. Tunable couplers in a superconducting quantum computer link two qubits and perform quantum computations by turning on and off the coupling between them. Current technology can turn off the coupling of transmon qubits*1 with close frequencies, but this is prone to crosstalk errors that occur on one of the qubits when the other qubit is irradiated with electromagnetic waves for control. In addition, current technology cannot completely turn off coupling for qubits with significantly different frequencies, resulting in errors due to residual coupling. Toshiba has recently devised a double-transmon coupler that can completely turn on and off the coupling between qubits with significantly different frequencies."</em> <a href="https://www.global.toshiba/ww/technology/corporate/rdc/rd/topics/22/2209-01.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4483.html">Highly integrated PFC boost controllers from STMicroelectronics eliminate startup-circuit design challenges</a></h2>

<p><em>"STMicroelectronics’ L4985A/B and L4986A/B power-factor correction (PFC) boost controllers simplify design and enhance flexibility by integrating 800V startup circuitry and additional valuable proprietary features. The built-in high-voltage startup capability saves auxiliary circuitry, allowing a “no aux” design that reduces bill-of-materials costs and ensures reliable starting. These circuits also include internal logic to safely discharge input-filter X capacitors when the AC line is disconnected. This eliminates the power losses incurred in a traditional discharge resistor and simplifies meeting safety regulations such as IEC 61010-1 or IEC 62368-1. The controllers suit multiple applications as PFC pre-regulators in equipment that must meet requirements for harmonic distortion, such as IEC 61000-3-2 and equivalents. These include power supplies for desktop PCs, servers, game consoles, and televisions, industrial and medical switched-mode power supplies (SMPS), and e-scooter chargers."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4483.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope shows off its capabilities closer to home with its first image of Neptune. Not only has Webb captured the clearest view of this distant planet’s rings in more than 30 years, but its cameras reveal the ice giant in a whole new light. Most striking in Webb’s new image is the crisp view of the planet’s rings – some of which have not been detected since NASA’s Voyager 2 became the first spacecraft to observe Neptune during its flyby in 1989. In addition to several bright, narrow rings, the Webb image clearly shows Neptune’s fainter dust bands. “It has been three decades since we last saw these faint, dusty rings, and this is the first time we’ve seen them in the infrared,” notes Heidi Hammel, a Neptune system expert and interdisciplinary scientist for Webb. Webb’s extremely stable and precise image quality permits these very faint rings to be detected so close to Neptune."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2022/new-webb-image-captures-clearest-view-of-neptune-s-rings-in-decades">[...]</a>

On Thursday, Sept. 29, at 2:36 a.m. PDT (5:36 a.m. EDT), NASA’s Juno spacecraft will come within 222 miles (358 kilometers) of the surface of Jupiter’s ice-covered moon, Europa. The solar-powered spacecraft is expected to obtain some of the highest-resolution images ever taken of portions of Europa’s surface, as well as collect valuable data on the moon’s interior, surface composition, and ionosphere, along with its interaction with Jupiter’s magnetosphere. Such information could benefit future missions, including the agency’s Europa Clipper, which is set to launch in 2024 to study the icy moon. “Europa is such an intriguing Jovian moon, it is the focus of its own future NASA mission,” said Juno Principal Investigator Scott Bolton of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. “We’re happy to provide data that may help the Europa Clipper team with mission planning, as well as provide new scientific insights into this icy world.” With an equatorial diameter of 1,940 miles (3,100 kilometers), Europa is about 90% the size of Earth’s Moon."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-juno-will-perform-close-flyby-of-jupiters-icy-moon-europa">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Cooling materials to extremely low temperatures is important for basic physics research as well as for technological applications. By improving a special refrigerator and a low-temperature thermometer, Basel scientists have now managed to cool an electric circuit on a chip down to 220 microkelvin – close to absolute zero. When materials are cooled down to extremely low temperatures, their behaviour often differs strongly from that at room temperature. A well-known example is superconductivity: below a critical temperature some metals and other substances conduct electric current without any losses. At even lower temperatures additional quantum-physical effects can occur, which are relevant for basic research as well as for applications in quantum technologies. However, to reach such temperatures – less than a thousandth of a degree above the absolute zero of 0 Kelvin, or -273.15 degrees Celsius – is exceedingly difficult."</em> <a href="https://www.unibas.ch/en/News-Events/News/Uni-Research/Ultracold-circuits.html">[...]</a>

The famous Pillars of Creation in the Eagle Nebulae—a star nursery—are believed to result from the hydrodynamic instabilities that form when plasmas are exposed to high intensity light from neighboring stars. Something very similar occurs—at a minute scale—when materials are imploded by converging laser beams during high-energy-density physics and fusion experiments at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics at the University of Rochester. “You shine the lasers, you evaporate mass off of the surface, and push everything radially inwards, and you have these hydrodynamic instabilities that have modulations similar to the Pillars,” says Hussein Aluie, associate professor of mechanical engineering at Rochester’s Hajim School of Engineering &amp; Applied Sciences. To what extent do plasmas undergoing instabilities generate magnetic fields, and how do those magnetic fields further influence the plasma instabilities? “It is well known that magnetic fields can strongly impact how plasmas behave,” Aluie says, “but the mechanisms for self-generation and amplification of magnetic fields in different types of plasma continue to be a mystery.” With funding from a $390,000 National Science Foundation grant, Aluie will address this mystery with co-PI Riccardo Betti, LLE’s chief scientist and Robert L.

<h2><a href="https://www.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/en/news/73027">Wrapping of nanosize copper cubes can help convert carbon dioxide into other chemicals</a></h2>

<p><em>"Researchers found a new way to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by wrapping copper nanocubes with an organic layer, solving instability and selectivity problems with copper nanocubes in catalysis, and improving how this electrocatalyst converts CO2 into organic molecules. As the need to mitigate climate change accelerates, scientists are trying to find new ways to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. One process, called electrochemical reduction or electrolysis, uses electricity and a catalyst to convert carbon dioxide into organic products that can be used in other ways. Unlike conversion between water and hydrogen, chemical recycling of carbon dioxide can produce various useable products because carbon can develop vast varieties of organic structures. One way to achieve electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide uses very tiny pieces of copper. While bulk copper metal has known to convert carbon dioxide into various organic molecules, these small pieces of copper can further improve catalytic activity not only by the increase of its surface area but also by the unique electronic structure of copper emerged from nanosizing."</em> <a href="https://www.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/en/news/73027">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Imagine this: Clothing that charges your smart watch as you walk, buildings that vibrate in the wind and power your lights, a road that extracts energy from the friction created by moving cars, and flexible structures that change shape in ocean waves to generate clean electricity for communities around the world. It is not science fiction. Someday, we could harness these naturally occurring energy sources thanks to a fledgling technology domain that just earned its first patent: distributed embedded energy converter technologies (or DEEC-Tec, pronounced deck-tech, for short). The invention’s first patent is specifically for applications in marine renewable energy—clean power generated from ocean and river waves, currents, and tides. But DEEC-Tec could eventually transform sources of everyday energy, including almost all physical motions or dynamic shape changes, into electricity or other forms of usable energy. “The DEEC-Tec domain has legs and is growing,” said Blake Boren, a senior engineer at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the lead inventor on the patent along with Jochem Weber, chief engineer for NREL’s water power program."</em> <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/news/program/2022/patented-wave-energy-technology-gets-its-sea-legs.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers have created the first computer-generated three-dimensional model of the Cat's Eye Nebula, revealing a pair of symmetric rings encircling the nebula’s outer shell. The rings’ symmetry suggests they were formed by a precessing jet, providing strong evidence for a binary star at the centre of the nebula. The study was led by Ryan Clairmont, who recently completed secondary school in the United States, and is published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. A planetary nebula forms when a dying solar-mass star ejects its outer layer of gas, creating a colourful, shell-like structure distinctive to these objects. The Cat’s Eye Nebula, also known as NGC 6543, is one of the most complex planetary nebulae known. It is just over 3,000 light-years away from Earth, and can be seen in the constellation Draco."</em> <a href="https://ras.ac.uk/news-and-press/research-highlights/cats-eye-nebula-seen-3d">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This self balancing mobile robot with pan &amp; tilt camera can be navigated remotely from host PC without the need to be in line of sight. Self-balancing mobile robots (SBMRs) are unique among others, just because of their ability to balance on a given fixed position. A typical SBMR measures inclination angle with the combination of accelerometer and gyroscope measurements and corrects itself by moving forward or backward to make the angle zero. Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller is used for deciding how much movement is required and at what rate to quickly correct the angle drift and stabilize the robot. Things become challenging when such a robot is to be navigated (moved or rotated) manually from remote location. This project demonstrates how to build a basic WiFi remote controlled 2 wheeled SBMR that has an on-board WiFi camera mounted on a servos powered pan &amp; tilt assembly."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/aadhuniklabs/self-balancing-wifi-controlled-robot-with-pantilt-camera-4b5762">[...]</a>

The flow sensor measurement range is from 1 to 30 liters per minute. The output of the sensor is a digital PWM signal with a frequency proportional to the water flow rate. Three GreenPAK Programmable Mixed-Signal Matrix SLG46533 ASICs count the number of pulses within a base time T. This base time is calculated such that the number of pulses is equal to the flow rate in that period, then this calculated number is displayed on the 7-segment displays."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/greenpak/water-flow-meter-fe22f9">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The purpose of this project is to develop an autonomous-line following vehicle for robotics/transport purposes. The vehicle may be used as a general robotics platform onto which other electronics may be added or explored. KITT uses 5 IR sensors to detect the position of the line. It is driven using two geared DC motors, with a swiveling caster wheel in the front. The system is powered using 8 AA batteries. This project was a joint effort with myself andAndrew Prata."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/KITT-a-Line-Following-Robot/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The USB PD Adapter is a USB Power Delivery trigger and monitoring board that enables you to use almost any USB Type-C PD power supply to run your projects with different selectable voltages and high currents. Important values such as voltage, current, power and energy are displayed on the OLED. The USB PD Adapter is based on the cheap and easy-to-use CH224K multi fast charging protocol power receiving chip, the INA219 voltage and current sensor IC, and an ATtiny204, 214, 404, 414, 804, 814, 1604 or 1614 microcontroller.

<h2><a href="https://www.instructables.com/A-Arduino-RP2040-Standalone-IoT-Computer-Running-B/">A Arduino RP2040 Standalone IoT Computer Running BASIC</a></h2>

<p><em>"This instructable is about building standalone computers running a BASIC dialect suitable for IoT and interactive work. It uses low cost components that are readily available and can be integrated without much difficulty. So why running BASIC on a microcontroller? Everyone who has programmed on 80s microcontrollers misses one thing on modern computer. It is the ease of use when you want to do something quickly. You could just type in a small program interactively, debug it and step by step extend it."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/A-Arduino-RP2040-Standalone-IoT-Computer-Running-B/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Two hand analog clock with automatic time adjustment using NTP via WiFi. Contrary to the formerWiFi Sync Clock, this clock works normally with monotonic CW rotation (except origin alignment once a day). - It resets the position of hands once a day at 0:00 (and initialization period after power on). The hands of the clock rotates CCW (counter clockwise) and stopped mechanically at 0:00. - Owing to the special hook mechanism, it can precisely align the position of the hands. - ESP32 microcontroller connects to the time server (ntp server) via WiFi."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/WiFi-Sync-Clock-2/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This is a hands-on demonstration of DC Motor Open Loop vs Closed Loop control. Students can simply touch the tires (or use a pencil etc.) and feel the difference between them. There are two very low power motors/tires. One has Open Loop control, and is not as strong.The other has Closed Loop control and increases the voltage when you interfere to try and keep the speed constant. Both can be stopped easily if you grab hard enough, but you can feel the difference."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/DC-Motor-Open-Loop-Vs-Closed-Loop-Demonstrator/">[...]</a>
