<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1846, o químico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ira_Remsen">Ira Remsen</a>. Ele, juntamente com Constantin Fahlberg descobriram a sacarina. Ensinou química na Universidade Johns Hopkins de 1876 (onde se tornou o seu segundo presidente em 1901-13). Introduziu instrução laboratorial avançada usando métodos de ensino que tinha aprendido na Alemanha sob Rudolph Fittig. Especializou-se no anel de benzeno e grupos afins. Com Constantin Fahlberg, um estudante que trabalhava sob a sua direcção, sintetizou pela primeira vez o orthobenzoyl sulfimide (1879). Fahlberg descobriu acidentalmente o seu sabor intensamente doce ao tocar os seus dedos nos seus lábios enquanto, sem o saber, tinha alguns grãos sobre eles. O composto foi patenteado e comercializado sob o nome comercial de "sacarina".</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1901, o Matemático germano-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Brauer">Richard Brauer</a>. Ele foi pioneiro no desenvolvimento da teoria da álgebra. Trabalhou com Weyl em vários projectos, incluindo um famoso artigo conjunto sobre spinors (publicado em 1935 no American Journal of Mathematics). Este trabalho serviu de base à teoria de Paul Dirac sobre o electrão giratório no âmbito da mecânica quântica. Com Nesbitt, Brauer introduziu a teoria dos blocos (1937). Brauer utilizou-a para obter resultados sobre grupos finitos, particularmente grupos finitos simples, e a teoria dos blocos teria um grande papel em grande parte do trabalho posterior de Brauer. Começando pela caracterização teórica dos grupos simples (1951), Brauer passou o resto da sua vida a formular um método para classificar todos os grupos finitos simples.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1902, o físico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Houser_Brattain">Walter Houser Brattain</a>. Ele partilhou (com John Bardeen e William B. Shockley) o Prémio Nobel da Física em 1956 pela investigação de semicondutores (materiais dos quais são feitos transístores) e pelo desenvolvimento do transístor. Na faculdade, disse ele, formou-se em física e matemática porque eram as únicas disciplinas em que ele era bom. Tornou-se um físico sólido com uma boa compreensão da teoria, mas a sua força estava na construção física de experiências. Trabalhando com as ideias de Shockley e Bardeen, as mãos de Brattain construíram o primeiro transístor. Em breve, o transístor substituiu o tubo de vácuo mais volumoso para muitas utilizações e foi o precursor de peças electrónicas micro-miniatura.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1931, o físico, engenheiro acústico e inventor norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Edward_Maceo_West">James West</a>. Ele desenvolveu a tecnologia do transdutor de electrões e a aplicou para co-inventar o microfone de alumínio do electrão. Devido aos benefícios do seu baixo custo, alta sensibilidade e forma compacta, este tipo de microfone predomina agora na maioria das aplicações. A sua carreira tomou forma quando ainda era licenciado em Física. Após os Verões como estagiário no Departamento de Investigação Acústica da Bell Labs, West foi-lhe atribuído um cargo a tempo inteiro após a graduação em 1957. De 1960-62, trabalhou com Gerhard M. Sessler para aperfeiçoar o microfone electret e, em 1968, estava em produção em massa. O seu nome está em mais de 250 patentes. Este tipo de microfone é agora amplamente encontrado em telefones, câmaras de vídeo e aparelhos auditivos.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1936, o cientista informático israelita <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lempel">Abraham Lempel</a>. Ele é um dos pais da família LZ de algoritmos de compressão de dados sem perdas. Os seus trabalhos historicamente importantes começam com a apresentação do algoritmo LZ77 num artigo intitulado "A Universal Algorithm for Sequential Data Compression" no IEEE Transactions on Information Theory (Maio de 1977), co-autoria de Jacob Ziv. Os algoritmos LZ77 e LZ78 de autoria de Lempel e Jacob Ziv levaram a uma série de trabalhos derivados, incluindo o algoritmo Lempel-Ziv-Welch, utilizado no formato de imagem GIF, e o algoritmo de cadeia Lempel-Ziv-Markov, utilizado nos compressores 7-Zip e xz. Os algoritmos foram também utilizados como originalmente publicados em formatos como o DEFLATE, utilizado no formato de imagem PNG.</p>

<p>Em 1996 o campeão mundial de xadrez Garry Kasparov perde o jogo para o computador Deep Blue. Um computador IBM capaz de avaliar 200 milhões de movimentos por segundo.  No entanto, o homem acabou por vencer a máquina, uma vez que Kasparov venceu o Deep Blue na partida com três vitórias e dois empates e levou para casa o prémio de 400.000 dólares. Cerca de 6 milhões de pessoas em todo o mundo acompanharam a acção online. Kasparov tinha anteriormente derrotado o Deep Thought, o protótipo do Deep Blue desenvolvido por investigadores da IBM em 1989, mas ele e outros mestres de xadrez tinham, por vezes, perdido para os computadores em jogos que duravam uma hora ou menos. O concurso de Fevereiro de 1996 foi significativo na medida em que representava a primeira vez que um humano e um computador o tinham eliminado num regulamento, jogo de seis jogos, em que cada jogador tinha duas horas para fazer 40 jogadas, duas horas para terminar as 20 jogadas seguintes e depois mais 60 minutos para encerrar o jogo.</p>

<p>E nesta semana que passou, uma ideia que tinha sido lançada no passado mês de Setembro deu mais um passo. Trata-se da soberania digital: A Comissão propõe a Lei dos Chips para fazer face à escassez de semicondutores e reforçar a liderança tecnológica da Europa. A Comissão propôs um conjunto abrangente de medidas para garantir a segurança do aprovisionamento, a resiliência e a liderança tecnológica da UE em tecnologias e aplicações de semicondutores. A Lei Europeia dos Chips reforçará a competitividade, a resiliência e ajudará a alcançar tanto a transição digital como a transição verde da Europa. A recente escassez global de semicondutores forçou o encerramento de fábricas numa vasta gama de sectores, desde automóveis a dispositivos de saúde. No sector automóvel, por exemplo, a produção em alguns Estados Membros diminuiu um terço em 2021. Isto tornou mais evidente a extrema dependência global da cadeia de valor dos semicondutores num número muito limitado de intervenientes num contexto geopolítico complexo. Mas também ilustrou a importância dos semicondutores para toda a indústria e sociedade europeia.</p>

<h2><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_22_729">Digital sovereignty: Commission proposes Chips Act to confront semiconductor shortages and strengthen Europe's technological leadership</a></h2>

<p><em>"Today, the Commission proposes a comprehensive set of measures to ensure the EU's security of supply, resilience and technological leadership in semiconductor technologies and applications. The European Chips Act will bolster Europe's competitiveness, resilience and help achieve both the digital and green transition. Recent global semiconductors shortages forced factory closures in a wide range of sectors from cars to healthcare devices. In the car sector, for example, production in some Member States decreased by one third in 2021. This made more evident the extreme global dependency of the semiconductor value chain on a very limited number of actors in a complex geopolitical context. But it also illustrated the importance of semiconductors for the entire European industry and society."</em> <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_22_729">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The planet’s auroras are known to produce low-energy X-ray light. A new study finally reveals higher-frequency X-rays and explains why they eluded another mission 30 years ago. Scientists have been studying Jupiter up close since the 1970s, but the gas giant is still full of mysteries. New observations by NASA’s NuSTAR space observatory have revealed the highest-energy light ever detected from Jupiter. The light, in the form of X-rays that NuSTAR can detect, is also the highest-energy light ever detected from a solar system planet other than Earth. A paper in the journal Nature Astronomy reports the finding and solves a decades-old mystery: Why the Ulysses mission saw no X-rays when it flew past Jupiter in 1992."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasa-telescope-spots-highest-energy-light-ever-detected-from-jupiter">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The first operational launch of Astra’s Rocket 3.3 vehicle failed Feb. 10 when the rocket’s upper stage appeared to tumble out of control after stage separation. The rocket, designated LV0008 by Astra, lifted off from Space Launch Complex 46 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station at 3 p.m. Eastern. The launch suffered several days of delays because of a range issue as well as a last-second scrub during the previous launch attempt Feb. 7. However, onboard video of the vehicle showed the upper stage tumbling shortly after separation from the first stage, three minutes after liftoff. The video suggests a potential issue with the separation of the payload fairing, which, according to a mission timeline provided by the company, takes place seconds before stage separation. “An issue has been experienced during flight that prevented the delivery of our customer payloads to orbit today."</em> <a href="https://spacenews.com/astra-launch-of-nasa-sponsored-cubesats-fails/">[...]</a>

Falcon 9’s second stage deployed the satellites into their intended orbit, with a perigee of approximately 210 kilometers above Earth, and each satellite achieved controlled flight. SpaceX deploys its satellites into these lower orbits so that in the very rare case any satellite does not pass initial system checkouts it will quickly be deorbited by atmospheric drag. While the low deployment altitude requires more capable satellites at a considerable cost to us, it’s the right thing to do to maintain a sustainable space environment. Unfortunately, the satellites deployed on Thursday were significantly impacted by a geomagnetic storm on Friday. These storms cause the atmosphere to warm and atmospheric density at our low deployment altitudes to increase."</em> <a href="https://www.spacex.com/updates/">[...]</a>

In a new paper in Physical Review Letters, a global research team led by MIT physics professor Nuh Gedik discovered an unusual hysteretic transition in a layered compound called EuTe4, where the hysteresis covers a giant temperature range of over 400 kelvins. This large thermal span not only breaks the record among crystalline solids, but also promises to introduce a new type of transition in materials that possess a layered structure.

Discovered around a half-decade ago, skyrmions have sparked interest in physics as a path toward next-generation computing devices that take advantage of the magnetic properties of particles — a field known as spintronics. “There has been a lot of research into the global dynamics of skyrmions, using their movements as a basis for performing computations,” said Gang Xiao, chair of the Department of Physics at Brown and senior author of the research."</em> <a href="https://www.brown.edu/news/2022-02-07/skyrmions">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Nanowires under tension create the basis for ultrafast transistors Smaller chips, faster computers, less energy consumption. Novel concepts based on semiconductor nanowires are expected to make transistors in microelectronic circuits better and more efficient. Electron mobility plays a key role in this: The faster electrons can accelerate in these tiny wires, the faster a transistor can switch and the less energy it requires. A team of researchers from the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR), the TU Dresden and NaMLab has now succeeded in experimentally demonstrating that electron mobility in nanowires is remarkably enhanced when the shell places the wire core under tensile strain. This phenomenon offers novel opportunities for the development of ultrafast transistors. Nanowires have a unique property: These ultra-thin wires can sustain very high elastic strains without damaging the crystal structure of the material."</em> <a href="https://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pNid=99&amp;pOid=65272">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scientists discover that triggering superconductivity with a flash of light involves the same fundamental physics that are at work in the more stable states needed for devices, opening a new path toward producing room-temperature superconductivity. Much like people can learn more about themselves by stepping outside of their comfort zones, researchers can learn more about a system by giving it a jolt that makes it a little unstable – scientists call this “out of equilibrium” – and watching what happens as it settles back down into a more stable state. In the case of a superconducting material known as yttrium barium copper oxide, or YBCO, experiments have shown that under certain conditions, knocking it out of equilibrium with a laser pulse allows it to superconduct – conduct electrical current with no loss – at much closer to room temperature than researchers expected. This could be a big deal, given that scientists have been pursuing room-temperature superconductors for more than three decades. But do observations of this unstable state have any bearing on how high-temperature superconductors would work in the real world, where applications like power lines, maglev trains, particle accelerators and medical equipment require them to be stable? A study published in Science Advances today suggests that the answer is yes."</em> <a href="https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/news/2022-02-09-study-raises-new-possibilities-triggering-room-temperature-superconductivity-light">[...]</a>

<p><em>"New research has shown that future gravitational wave detections from space will be capable of finding new fundamental fields and potentially shed new light on unexplained aspects of the Universe. Professor Thomas Sotiriou from the University of Nottingham’s Centre of Gravity and Andrea Maselli, researcher at GSSI and INFN associate, together with researchers from SISSA, and La Sapienza of Rome, showed the unprecedented accuracy with which gravitational wave observations by the space interferometer LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna), will be able to detect new fundamental fields. The research has been published in Nature Astronomy. In this new study researchers suggest that LISA, the space-based gravitational-wave (GW) detector which is expected to be launched by ESA in 2037 will open up new possibilities for the exploration of the Universe. Professor Thomas Sotiriou, Director of the Nottingham Centre of Gravity explains: “New fundamental fields, and in particular scalars, have been suggested in a variety of scenarios: as explanations for dark matter, as the cause for the accelerated expansion of the Universe, or as low-energy manifestations of a consistent and complete description of gravity and elementary particles. We have now shown that LISA will offer unprecedented capabilities in detecting scalar fields and this offers exciting opportunities for testing these scenarios.” Observations of astrophysical objects with weak gravitational fields and small spacetime curvature have provided no evidence of such fields so far."</em> <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/future-gravitational-wave-detector-in-space-could-uncover-secrets-of-the-universe">[...]</a>

Some magnetic fields of great interest, for example those produced by the brain, are extraordinarily weak, a billion times weaker than the field of the Earth, and therefore, extremely sensitive magnetometers are required to detect these weak fields.

Researchers from the EUROfusion consortium – 4,800 experts, students and staff from across Europe, co-funded by the European Commission – more than doubled previous records achieved in 1997 at the UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) site in Oxford using the same fuel mixture to be used by commercial fusion energy powerplants. 59 megajoules of sustained fusion energy was demonstrated by scientists and engineers working on the Joint European Torus (JET), the largest and most powerful operational tokamak machine in the world.

An M5StickC Plus (ESP32 pico) which I had obtained some time ago should serve as internet radio player. It provides built-in WiFi, an LCD, some buttons, and I²S output for digital audio. To achieve a sufficiently high audio quality, I decided to use an external digital-to-analog audio converter, the PCM5102A, with a line-out port. Luckily, some similar projects exist already, and there is a great library - the ESP32-audioI2S - which does most of the work."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/esikora/esp32-internet-radio-with-i-s-dac-a5515c">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Relay Shield can be used to be control devices wirelessly with your smartphone from anywhere. Every household has electronic devices which are a major part of our everyday life like dishwashers, washing machines, boilers (water heaters), kettles. All of the previous devices are a combination of mechanical – electronic – power sets. The main part of devices operation is electrical power. It’s well known that AC electrical power is dangerous for humans and that’s exactly the type of power for devices operation. For example, if you leave your kids at home alone, they could turn on, by accident, an electrical stove which can produce fire in your house."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/arshmahmughal77/relay-shield-pcb-design-useful-for-iot-applications-9dd304">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.instructables.com/Password-Vault-V30/">Password Vault V3.0</a></h2>

<p><em>"Let me begin this tutorial by reminding you that storing your passwords in an unencrypted form is the same as keeping the key from your house under the mat. Your house might have the best lock in the world, but what's the point in it if you keep the key from it in an easily accessible place? That's the problem I'm trying to solve by making this device. I'm trying to give you the ability to securely store your passwords, keys, and other important stuff. This version of the password vault is a device that has the capability to encrypt your passwords, store the encrypted passwords in its built-in memory, hash passwords, and securely send passwords to another device. In addition to that, you can also set the master password and the initialization vector (increment the key) to prevent an attacker from decrypting your passwords by simply obtaining physical access to your vault."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Password-Vault-V30/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Around 5 years back I made a Floor Cleaning Robot (CleanSweep) from scratch, which was a hit and a lot of people followed the guide and tried making their own robot. But that design actually had some flaws. So last year I had to make my Engineering Mini Project and I decided to work on the same idea but with some improvements. However, it is quite ironical that even after 3 years of university I worked on the same project that I built when I was in school (lol). In this instructable, I will present you Version 2.0 of the Floor Cleaning Robot, with some improvements over the previous version. This one is also controlled from a phone app via bluetooth but here I have also added autonomous control (which a lot of people requested)."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/The-Ultimate-Floor-Cleaning-Robot-v20/">[...]</a>
