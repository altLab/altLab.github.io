<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1806, o inventor norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Singer">Isaac Merrit Singer</a>. Ele inventou uma máquina de costura prática. Enquanto actor, inventou uma escavadora (1839) e um escultor de madeira (1849), antes de se tornar mecânico itinerante e de melhorar a máquina de costura. A sua primeira patente de máquina de costura, emitida a 12 de Agosto de 1851 (U.S. No. 8294), tinha um desenho de banda de rodagem, alimentação contínua, e uma agulha reta e vertical como as máquinas modernas. Chegou a acordo com Elias Howe por violação da sua anterior (1846) patente de máquina de costura. A empresa então fundada por Singer (1856) foi, dentro da década, o maior fabricante mundial de máquinas de costura. A sua maior invenção foi uma nova forma de marketing para os consumidores. Gastou generosamente em publicidade, foi pioneiro na compra a preços acessíveis por crédito a prestações, e prestou serviço pós-venda. Em 1863, reformou-se, com mais 12 patentes sobre as suas máquinas.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1864, o inventor e fabricante norte-americano <a href="https://www.automotivehalloffame.org/honoree/john-m-mack/">John M. Mack</a>. Ele co-fundou a Mack Brothers Company (1902), que se tornou Mack Trucks Inc. (1922), fabricantes de camiões pesados resistentes. Em 1890, começou a trabalhar para uma empresa que fabricava carruagens e vagões em Nova Iorque, que comprou posteriormente (1893) e dirigiu com os seus irmãos. Por volta de 1900, os irmãos Mack produziram o seu primeiro grande veículo de sucesso, um autocarro de 40 cv com capacidade para 20 passageiros, chamado Manhattan. Construíram mais autocarros, e em 1905, expandiram-se para a fabricação de camiões, com cerca de 100 trabalhadores. Em 1910, Mack produziu o primeiro camião motorizado de gancho e bexiga para bombeiros. John inventou o motor do tipo Mack "Bulldog". O bulldog continua a ser o ícone da empresa actual e parte do seu logótipo.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1940, o inventor russo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitri_Z._Garbuzov">Dmitri Z. Garbuzov</a>. Ele foi um dos pioneiros e inventores dos lasers de díodos de funcionamento contínuo a temperatura ambiente e dos lasers de díodos de alta potência. Os primeiros lasers de díodos de onda contínua de temperatura ambiente foram inventados, desenvolvidos e quase simultaneamente demonstrados no Instituto Físico-Técnico Ioffe em Leningrado, Rússia, por uma equipa que inclui Garbuzov e Zhores Alferov (vencedor do Prémio Nobel da Física de 2000), e pela equipa concorrente de I. Hayashi e M. Panish nos Laboratórios Bell Telephone em Murray Hill, Nova Jersey. Ambas as equipas alcançaram este feito em 1970. Garbuzov foi também responsável pelo desenvolvimento de lasers de diodo práticos de alta potência e alta eficiência numa variedade de bandas de comprimento de onda, desde comprimentos de onda visíveis até comprimentos de onda de infravermelhos médios.</p>

<p>Em 1904, o primeiro sistema ferroviário subterrâneo e subaquático nos EUA, o metro da cidade de Nova Iorque, começou a funcionar. Mesmo com linhas férreas elevadas a surgir em torno da cidade, a necessidade de um metropolitano de trânsito rápido era óbvia para descongestionar as ruas e espalhar o desenvolvimento da cidade para as áreas periféricas. Quase 8.000 homens participaram na construção do traçado dos 3,6 km, sob o comando do engenheiro-chefe, William Barclay Parsons. A construção do metro foi uma tarefa complexa e perigosa; pelo menos 44 pessoas morreram no esforço: Este primeiro metro de trânsito rápido, o IRT (Interborough Rapid Transit), foi inaugurado em Nova Iorque pelo Presidente da Câmara McLellan. O preço do metro e do autocarro foi fixado em um níquel.</p>

<p><em>"“As something falls from a high position to a low position, it gains kinetic energy by losing gravitational potential.” It is a sentence that could belong in any physics textbook. But Associate Professor Yamaguchi Hiroya is not discussing the quintessential student problem of dropping an object into a well. Instead, he is describing the formation of the largest structures in the Universe: galaxy clusters. The activity within these cosmological monoliths have long remained unclear, but this is set to change with the launch of the XRISM X-ray Space Observatory next fiscal year. Shortly after the birth of the Universe, all matter was spread nearly homogeneously throughout space. But tiny variations in the distribution created pockets of slightly higher mass, and these exerted a gravitational tug on their surroundings that drew in more matter."</em> <a href="https://cosmos.isas.jaxa.jp/as-xrism-prepares-to-launch-what-might-the-telescope-reveal-about-the-largest-structures-in-our-universe/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"With an embedded gate driver and a microcontroller engine, ecoSpin™ BLDC motor control solutions provide reliable, scalable operation up to 600V onsemi (Nasdaq: ON), a leader in intelligent power and sensing technologies, today introduced its new ecoSpin™ family of brushless DC (BLDC) motor controllers. By combining the control and driver functions in a complete system-in-package (SiP) solution, onsemi simplifies the development of high-voltage motor control systems in applications such as HVAC, refrigeration and robotics. The first member of the ecoSpin family to be launched is the ECS640A, a three-phase brushless DC (BLDC) motor controller designed for reliable high-voltage operation up to 600 V. The small-form-factor ECS640A features a trusted gate driver, Arm® Cortex-M0+ microcontroller, three sense amplifiers, three bootstrap diodes and can support either sensored or sensorless motor control architectures. “The highly integrated solution reduces time to market by eliminating the need for design cycles on applications, simplifying solution reuse when scaling BLDC motor power level requirements,” said Michel De Mey, vice president of the Industrial Solutions Division, onsemi. “Reliability is improved by replacing many of the larger, more complex devices, while at the same time shrinking the PCB routing area by approximately 20% compared to a discrete implementation, to deliver an overall compact solution.” The integration in a single IC package (10 by 13 mm) redefines BLDC motor control performance by optimizing power stage placement and reducing noise. This allows rapid reuse in alternative platforms by simply changing the discrete power devices and updating the software."</em> <a href="https://www.onsemi.com/company/news-media/press-announcements/en/onsemi-redefines-brushless-dc-motor-control-with-ecospin-family">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Iron isotopes in samples from asteroid Ryugu suggest its origin to lie beyond the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn Astronomy Astrophysics Solar System The asteroid Ryugu likely formed at the outer edge of the Solar System beyond the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn, as high-precision measurements that determine the ratio of iron isotopes in rock samples from Ryugu suggest. The Japanese space probe Hayabusa 2 had taken the samples and brought them back to Earth two years ago. An international group of researchers with participation of the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS) in Göttingen and the Georg-August-University Göttingen describes these results in today’s issue of the journal Science Advances. According to their findings, Ryugu's “list of ingredients” differs significantly from that of typical carbon-rich meteorites in one crucial point. Instead, everything indicates a close kinship to a rare group of meteorites that is likewise associated to the outer Solar System. The study is one of three publications that the journals Science and Science Advances today dedicate to asteroid Ryugu."</em> <a href="https://www.mpg.de/19388956/1020-aero-asteroid-ryugu-a-traveler-from-the-edge-of-the-solar-system-151060-x?c=2249">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Jellyfish-like soft gripper mimics the mechanics of curly hair If you’ve ever played the claw game at an arcade, you know how hard it is to grab and hold onto objects using robotics grippers. Imagine how much more nerve-wracking that game would be if, instead of plush stuffed animals, you were trying to grab a fragile piece of endangered coral or a priceless artifact from a sunken ship. Most of today’s robotic grippers rely on embedded sensors, complex feedback loops, or advanced machine learning algorithms, combined with the skill of the operator, to grasp fragile or irregularly shaped objects. But researchers from the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) have demonstrated an easier way. Taking inspiration from nature, they designed a new type of soft, robotic gripper that uses a collection of thin tentacles to entangle and ensnare objects, similar to how jellyfish collect stunned prey. Alone, individual tentacles, or filaments, are weak."</em> <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2022/10/tentacle-robot-can-gently-grasp-fragile-objects">[...]</a>

They inhabit the center of every atom in the universe and play a critical role in one of the strongest forces in Nature. And yet, protons have a down-to-earth side, too. Like most particles, protons have spin that act like tiny magnets. Flipping a proton’s spin or polarity may sound like science fiction, but it is the basis of technological breakthroughs that have become essential to our daily lives, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the invaluable medical diagnostics tool.

<h2><a href="https://news.nus.edu.sg/revolutionary-technique-to-generate-hydrogen-more-efficiently-from-water/">NUS researchers devise revolutionary technique to generate hydrogen more efficiently from water</a></h2>

<p><em>"A team of researchers from the National University of Singapore (NUS) have made a serendipitous scientific discovery that could potentially revolutionise the way water is broken down to release hydrogen gas - an element crucial to many industrial processes. The team, led by Associate Professor Xue Jun Min, Dr Wang Xiaopeng and Dr Vincent Lee Wee Siang from the Department of Materials Science and Engineering under the NUS College of Design and Engineering (NUS CDE), found that light can trigger a new mechanism in a catalytic material used extensively in water electrolysis, where water is broken down into hydrogen and oxygen. The result is a more energy-efficient method of obtaining hydrogen. This breakthrough was achieved in collaboration with Dr Xi Shibo from the Institute of Sustainability for Chemicals, Energy and Environment under the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR); Dr Yu Zhigen from the Institute of High Performance Computing under A*STAR; and Dr Wang Hao from the Department of Mechanical Engineering under the NUS CDE. “We discovered that the redox center for electro-catalytic reaction is switched between metal and oxygen, triggered by light,” said Assoc Prof Xue. “This largely improves the water electrolysis efficiency.” The new finding can potentially open up new and more effective industrial methods of producing hydrogen and putting this environmentally friendly source of fuel within the reach of more people and industries."</em> <a href="https://news.nus.edu.sg/revolutionary-technique-to-generate-hydrogen-more-efficiently-from-water/">[...]</a>

The next generation of phones and wireless devices are going to need new antennae to access higher and higher frequency ranges. One way to make antennae that work at tens of gigahertz — the frequencies needed for 5G and higher devices — is to braid filaments about 1 micrometer in diameter. But today’s industrial fabrication techniques won’t work on fibers that small. Now a team of researchers from the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) has developed a simple machine that uses the surface tension of water to grab and manipulate microscopic objects, offering a potentially powerful tool for nanoscopic manufacturing.

<p><em>"Clean hydrogen fuel is easier to produce from seawater with stable hierarchical electrocatalysts. Oct 26, 2022 Seawater, which comprises more than 95 percent of the Earth’s water, could become a key resource in the sustainable production of clean hydrogen fuel with use of water-splitting catalysts developed by a KAUST-led team. Water splitting could offer an appealing way to carbon neutrality, especially when coupled with renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. Water splitting involves the breakdown of water in an electrochemical cell to produce hydrogen at the cathode while generating oxygen at the anode under applied voltage. Yet, hydrogen and oxygen evolution catalysts that perform well in fresh water become less effective in seawater because of abundant ions that can promote unwanted reactions and poison catalysts. Highly corrosive chloride ions present in seawater undergo complex reactions that compete with oxygen evolution and generate harmful compounds, such as hypochlorite."</em> <a href="https://discovery.kaust.edu.sa/en/article/1287/tapping-into-seawater's-energetic-potential">[...]</a>

Using a simple set of magnets, MIT researchers have come up with a sophisticated way to monitor muscle movements, which they hope will make it easier for people with amputations to control their prosthetic limbs.

The studies, performed in animals, offer hope that this strategy could be used to help people with prosthetic devices control them in a way that more closely mimics natural limb movement. “These recent results demonstrate that this tool can be used outside the lab to track muscle movement during natural activity, and they also suggest that the magnetic implants are stable and biocompatible and that they don’t cause discomfort,” says Cameron Taylor, an MIT research scientist and co-lead author of both papers.

<p><em>"JILA and NIST Fellow James K. Thompson’s team of researchers have for the first time successfully combined two of the “spookiest” features of quantum mechanics to make a better quantum sensor: entanglement between atoms and delocalization of atoms. Einstein originally referred to entanglement as creating spooky action at a distance—the strange effect of quantum mechanics in which what happens to one atom somehow influences another atom somewhere else. Entanglement is at the heart of hoped-for quantum computers, quantum simulators and quantum sensors. A second rather spooky aspect of quantum mechanics is delocalization, the fact that a single atom can be in more than one place at the same time. As described in their paper recently published in Nature, the Thompson group has combined the spookiness of both entanglement and delocalization to realize a matter-wave interferometer that can sense accelerations with a precision that surpasses the standard quantum limit (a limit on the accuracy of an experimental measurement at a quantum level) for the first time. By doubling down on the spookiness, future quantum sensors will be able to provide more precise navigation, explore for needed natural resources, more precisely determine fundamental constants such as the fine structure and gravitational constants, look more precisely for dark matter, or maybe even one day detect gravitational waves."</em> <a href="https://jila.colorado.edu/news-events/articles/entangled-matter-wave-interferometer-now-double-spookiness">[...]</a>

Biomedical and electrical engineers at UNSW Sydney have developed a new way to measure neural activity using light – rather than electricity – which could lead to a complete reimagining of medical technologies like nerve-operated prosthetics and brain-machine interfaces. Professor François Ladouceur, with UNSW’s School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, says the multi-disciplinary team has just demonstrated in the lab what it proved theoretically shortly before the pandemic: that sensors built using liquid crystal and integrated optics technologies – dubbed ‘optrodes’ – can register nerve impulses in a living animal body. Not only do these optrodes perform just as well as conventional electrodes – that use electricity to detect a nerve impulse – but they also address “very thorny issues that competing technologies cannot address”, says Prof. Ladouceur. “Firstly, it’s very difficult to shrink the size of the interface using conventional electrodes so that thousands of them can connect to thousands of nerves within a very small area. “One of the problems as you shrink thousands of electrodes and put them ever closer together to connect to the biological tissues is that their individual resistance increases, which degrades the signal-to-noise ratio so we have a problem reading the signal."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/science-tech/engineers-light-way-bionics-future">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Applications in tissue scaffolds for artificial organs, and functional devices The University of Amsterdam has reached a license agreement with the Gouda-based company atum3D on a method for fast, large-scale 3D-printing with sub-micron resolution. The method, developed at the university’s Van ‘t Hoff Institute for Molecular Sciences, combines photo- and stereo-lithography to produce high-resolution features at scale. Potential applications include tissue scaffolds for regenerative medicine, and devices for microfluidics and chromatography. When it comes to 3D-printing of large objects, current methods in general offer either high resolutions or high speed printing. The method now licensed to atum3D combines the two features in such a way that it offers opportunities in many areas ranging from tissue scaffolds to components for microfluidics and optics. It was invented by Dr Suhas Nawada, at the time a post-doctoral researcher at the Van ‘t Hoff Institute for Molecular Sciences."</em> <a href="https://www.uva.nl/en/shared-content/subsites/van-t-hoff-institute-for-molecular-sciences/en/news/2022/10/uva-grants-license-on-fast-3d-printing-with-sub-micrometre-detail.html">[...]</a>

An RTOS is distinct from a time sharing operating system, such as Unix, which manages the sharing of system resources with a scheduler, data buffers, or fixed task prioritization in a multitasking or multiprogramming environment. Processing time requirements need to be fully understood and bound rather than just kept as a minimum. All processing must occur within the defined constraints. Real-time operating systems are event-driven and preemptive, meaning the OS is capable of monitoring the relevant priority of completing tasks, and make changes to the task priority."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/lctuyenvn/esp32-blynk-freertos-1d2d45">[...]</a>
