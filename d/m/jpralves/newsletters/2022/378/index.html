<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1907, o inventor e fabricante norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Tupper">Earl Tupper</a>. Ele introduziu a Tupperware. Na década de 1930, Tupper inventou um material flexível e leve que foi utilizado para fazer máscaras de plástico de gás durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial. Ao trabalhar na DuPont (1937-38), ganhou experiência na concepção de plásticos e saiu por conta própria. Nos anos 40, os produtos plásticos tinham a reputação de serem frágeis, gordurosos, malcheirosos e geralmente pouco fiáveis. Primeiro, desenvolveu um método de purificação da escória preta de polietileno, um produto residual produzido em refinamento de petróleo, numa substância que era flexível, resistente, não porosa, não gordurosa e translúcida. Em segundo lugar, desenvolveu o selo Tupper, uma tampa hermética e estanque à água modelada na tampa para recipientes de tinta. Juntas, estas inovações lançaram as bases para o sucesso futuro da Tupperware como produto de consumo. A sua empresa teve grande sucesso ao comercializar através da ideia da Brownie Wise das partes da Tupperware.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1915, o físico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_H._Townes">Charles H. Townes</a>. Ele partilhou (com os físicos soviéticos Aleksandr M. Prokhorov e Nikolay G. Basov) o Prémio Nobel da Física de 1964 "pelo trabalho fundamental no campo da electrónica quântica, que levou à construção de osciladores e amplificadores baseados no princípio maser-laser". Tinha aplicado a física de microondas para estudar as interacções entre microondas e moléculas, produzindo espectros de microondas, que pensava poder ser utilizados para determinar a estrutura das moléculas, átomos e núcleos. Em vez disso, a partir deste trabalho, em 1951, concebeu a ideia do maser e perseguiu esse objectivo. No início de 1954, utilizando o gás amoníaco como meio, foram obtidos os primeiros resultados da amplificação e geração de ondas electromagnéticas por emissão estimulada. Cunharam a palavra maser para este dispositivo, um acrónimo que utiliza as letras iniciais de "Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation" (Amplificação por Microondas por Emissão Estimulada de Radiação).</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1954, o matemático alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerd_Faltings">Gerd Faltings</a>. Ele recebeu a Medalha Fields de 1986 (a maior honra que um jovem matemático pode receber) principalmente pela sua prova da Conjectura de Mordell, que conseguiu utilizando métodos de geometria algébrica aritmética. Foi também estreitamente ligado ao trabalho que conduziu à prova final do Último Teorema de Fermat por Andrew Wiles. Em 1983, Faltings provou que para cada n > 2 há, no máximo, um número finito de inteiros de coprime x, y, z com xn + yn = zn. Este foi um passo importante, mas uma prova de que o número finito era 0 em todos os casos não parecia provável que se seguisse, alargando os argumentos da Falting. No entanto, Faltings foi a pessoa natural a quem Wiles recorreu quando quis uma opinião sobre a correcção da sua reparação da sua prova do último teorema de Fermat em 1994.</p>

<p>Em 1858, as impressões digitais foram utilizadas pela primeira vez como meio de identificação.</p>

<p>Em 1883, o Sr. Ferry pedalou um triciclo de água através do Canal da Mancha. Partiu de Dover cerca das nove horas da manhã, e chegou a Calais em menos de oito horas. A distância em linha recta era de vinte milhas, mas por causa das correntes, o esforço necessário foi consideravelmente aumentado. A construção do seu veículo foi ilustrada em La Nature. Rodas de pás volumosas (provavelmente precisando de mais deslocamento do que o mostrado) substituem as rodas de um triciclo terrestre. A pequena roda atrás actuava como um leme.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker e alguns vídeos interessantes. São apresentadas as revistas Hackspace Magazine nº57 e a MagPI nº120 de Agosto.</p>

<p><em>"This advanced mission architecture will include two sample recovery helicopters. NASA has finished the system requirements review for its Mars Sample Return Program, which is nearing completion of the conceptual design phase. During this phase, the program team evaluated and refined the architecture to return the scientifically selected samples, which are currently in the collection process by NASA’s Perseverance rover in the Red Planet’s Jezero Crater. The architecture for the campaign, which includes contributions from the European Space Agency (ESA), is expected to reduce the complexity of future missions and increase probability of success. “The conceptual design phase is when every facet of a mission plan gets put under a microscope,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for science at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “There are some significant and advantageous changes to the plan, which can be directly attributed to Perseverance’s recent successes at Jezero and the amazing performance of our Mars helicopter.” This advanced mission architecture takes into consideration a recently updated analysis of Perseverance’s expected longevity."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasa-will-inspire-world-when-it-returns-mars-samples-to-earth-in-2033">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Three new devices in DSN1006 and DSN1010 save power and simplify thermal management in space-constrained applications Nexperia, the expert in essential semiconductors, has introduced the PMCB60XN and PMCB60XNE 30V N-channel small-signal trench MOSFETs, with market-leading RDS(on) in the ultra-compact wafer-level DSN1006 package, to make energy go further where space is tight and battery runtime is critical. Ideal for highly miniaturized electronics like smartphones, smart watches, hearing aids, and earphones, the new MOSFETs support the trend towards greater intelligence and richer functionality that raise system power demand. With RDS(on) up to 25% better than competing devices, they minimize energy losses and increase efficiency in load switching and battery management. Their superior performance also reduces self heating thereby enhancing user comfort in wearable devices. Specifically, the PMCB60XN and PMCB60XNE have maximum RDS(on) of 50mΩ and 55mΩ respectively, at VGS = 4.5V. This gives them the lowest on-resistance per die area among similar 30V MOSFETs in the market."</em> <a href="https://www.nexperia.com/about/news-events/press-releases/Nexperia-reveals-wafer-level-12---30V-MOSFETs-with-market-leading-efficiency.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Toshiba Electronic Devices &amp; Storage Corporation (“Toshiba”) has developed silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFETs with low on-resistance and significantly reduced switching loss—about 20% lower than in its second-generation SiC MOSFETs. Power devices are essential components for managing and reducing power consumption in all kinds of electronic equipment, and for achieving a carbon neutral society. SiC is widely seen as the next generation material for power devices, as it delivers higher voltages and lower losses than silicon. While SiC power devices are now mainly utilized in inverters for trains, wider application is on the horizon, in vehicle electrification and the miniaturization of industrial equipment. However, the adoption and market growth of SiC devices have been held back by reliability issues. Toshiba has solved this problem by adopting a structure in which a Schottky Barrier Diode (SBD) is placed in parallel with the PN diode inside the SiC MOSFET of the second-generation product."</em> <a href="https://toshiba.semicon-storage.com/ap-en/company/news/news-topics/2022/07/sic-power-devices-20220722-1.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"China on Sunday launched the second of three modules to its permanent space station, in one of the final missions needed to complete the orbiting outpost by year's end. A live feed on state broadcaster CCTV showed the 23-tonne Wentian ("Quest for the Heavens") laboratory module launching on the back of China's most powerful rocket, the Long March 5B, at 2:22 p.m. (0622 GMT) from the Wenchang Space Launch Center on the southern island of Hainan. Space agency staff, seen on the live feed observing the progress of the launch from a control room, cheered and applauded when the Wentian separated from the rocket about 10 minutes after the launch. The launch was "a complete success", CCTV reported shortly after. China began constructing the space station in April 2021 with the launch of the Tianhe module, the main living quarters, in the first of 11 crewed and uncrewed missions in the undertaking. The Wentian lab module, 17.9 metres (59 feet) long, will be where astronauts can carry out scientific experiments, along with the other lab module yet to be launched - Mengtian ("Dreaming of the Heavens")."</em> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-launches-second-space-station-module-wentian-2022-07-24/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.phys.ethz.ch/news-and-events/d-phys-news/2022/07/a-key-role-for-quantum-entanglement.html">A key role for quantum entanglement</a></h2>

<p><em>"A method known as quantum key distribution has long held the promise of communication security unattainable in conventional cryptography. An international team of scientists, including ETH physicists, has now demonstrated experimentally, for the first time, an approach to quantum key distribution that uses high-​quality quantum entanglement to provide much broader security guarantees than previous schemes. The art of cryptography is to skilfully transform messages so that they become meaningless to everyone but the intended recipients. Modern cryptographic schemes, such as those underpinning digital commerce, prevent adversaries from illegitimately deciphering messages — say, credit-​card information — by requiring them to perform mathematical operations that consume a prohibitively large amount of computational power. Starting from the 1980s, however, ingenious theoretical concepts have been introduced in which security does not depend on the eavesdropper’s finite number-​crunching capabilities. Instead, basic laws of quantum physics limit how much information, if any, an adversary can ultimately intercept."</em> <a href="https://www.phys.ethz.ch/news-and-events/d-phys-news/2022/07/a-key-role-for-quantum-entanglement.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Good things can indeed come in small packages, especially when it relates to satellite technology. Scientists at the University of New Hampshire have found that innovative miniature CubeSats, usually no larger than a box of tissues, can be just as effective in performing important space science missions as their larger counterparts, often with tolerable risk, significantly lower cost and comparatively high scientific return. “We wanted to see if CubeSats, which are gaining popularity in space research, can hold their own by producing significant, quality science to help better understand space weather which can wreak havoc on space-age technologies such as GPS and telecommunications, produce radiation risks to astronauts, and even cause power outages on Earth through disruptions of the power grid,” said Harlan Spence, professor of physics and lead author. In their study, recently published in the journal Space Weather, the researchers compared five successful space weather CubeSat missions that operated over the last 10 years with five larger NASA space science missions flown during the same time period. First, they looked at size and cost. Each of the five CubeSats weighed about three kilograms (less than a gallon of milk) and the missions cost just over a million dollars, running between $1.2 million and $1.3 million."</em> <a href="https://www.unh.edu/unhtoday/news/release/2022/07/28/unh-research-finds-tiny-cubesats-can-offer-big-scientific-bang-buck">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A team led by quantum physicist Immanuel Bloch has developed a new method to cool gases of polar molecules to near absolute zero. This paves the way for studying quantum effects of exotic forms of matter. When a highly diluted gas is cooled to extremely low temperatures, bizarre properties are revealed. Thus, some gases form a so-called Bose-Einstein condensate - a type of matter in which all atoms move in unison. Another example is supersolidity: a state in which matter behaves like a frictionless fluid with a periodic structure. Physicists expect to find particularly diverse and revealing forms of quantum matter when cooling gases consisting of polar molecules."</em> <a href="https://www.lmu.de/en/newsroom/news-overview/news/the-big-chill-a-microwave-freezer-for-molecules.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"pH — the concentration of protons in a watery solution — indicates how acidic the solution is. It regulates a broad range of natural and engineered chemical processes, including the synthesis of designed DNA sequences for applications in biotechnology. Changing the pH uniformly across an entire water-based solution is a standard practice in chemistry. But what if researchers could create an array of localized pH regions where protons are more intensely concentrated than in other parts of the solution? This would allow them to perform pH-regulated chemistry at each of those locations in parallel, dramatically increasing the experimental throughput and speeding up processes in DNA synthesis, which has applications in genomics, synthetic biology, vaccine development and other therapies, and data storage. But localizing pH is a challenge because protons spread out fast in a water-based solution."</em> <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2022/07/programming-ph">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A crucial but poorly-studied parameter that dictates battery performance is the migration barrier. It determines the rate at which ions move through an electrode inside the battery, and ultimately the rate at which it charges or discharges. Because it is hard to measure the migration barrier in the lab, researchers typically use different computer simulations or approximations to quickly predict migration barrier values. However, very few of these simulations have been experimentally verified so far. In a new study, researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and their collaborators comprehensively analysed widely-used computational techniques, and verified their predictions of the migration barrier values against actual data observed in lab measurements. Based on their analysis, the team proposes a set of robust guidelines to help researchers choose the most accurate computational framework for testing materials that can be used to develop highly efficient batteries in the future."</em> <a href="https://iisc.ac.in/events/computer-simulations-aid-scientists-in-gauging-battery-performance/">[...]</a>

Tandem solar cells that combine perovskite and silicon-based subcells in one device are expected to better capture and convert sunlight into electricity than their conventional single-junction silicon analogs at a lower cost. However, when sunlight strikes the perovskite subcell, the resulting pairs of electrons and positively charged holes tend to recombine at the interface between perovskite and the electron-transport layer. Also, a mismatch between energy levels at this interface hinders electron separation within the cell. Cumulatively, these problems lower the maximum operating voltage available, or open-circuit voltage, of the tandem cells and limit device performance."</em> <a href="https://discovery.kaust.edu.sa/en/article/1266/one-more-slice-to-drive-the-solar-stack">[...]</a>

By redesigning how fluids are simulated, KAUST researchers have demonstrated a more than tenfold speed increase on the previous state of the art for slow-flowing viscous liquids. Modeling the behavior of liquids is important for a wide range of applications, from industrial processes and medical devices to computer graphics and visual simulations. However, despite many years of development and known physics dating back over 100 years, the ability to accurately simulate liquid flow remains one of the most computationally challenging aspects of creating digital replicas of the real world. This is because the flow and behavior of liquids is determined by both the pressure distribution through the liquid and, in the case of thick viscous liquids, the pressure-dependent internal resistance to that flow. Precisely calculating these complex and time-varying distributions is very computationally intensive, and so many optimization schemes have been developed to speed up this calculation process at the expense of accuracy."</em> <a href="https://discovery.kaust.edu.sa/en/article/1263/watching-viscous-flow,-but-faster">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers publish scenario that explains 2016 discovery by NASA’s Curiosity rover Planetary scientists from Rice University, NASA’s Johnson Space Center and the California Institute of Technology have an answer to a mystery that’s puzzled the Mars research community since NASA’s Curiosity rover discovered a mineral called tridymite in Gale Crater in 2016. Tridymite is a high-temperature, low-pressure form of quartz that is extremely rare on Earth, and it wasn’t immediately clear how a concentrated chunk of it ended up in the crater.Gale Crater was chosen as Curiosity’s landing site due to the likelihood that it once held liquid water, and Curiosity found evidence that confirmed Gale Crater was a lake as recently as 1 billion years ago. “The discovery of tridymite in a mudstone in Gale Crater is one of the most surprising observations that the Curiosity rover has made in 10 years of exploring Mars,” said Rice’s Kirsten Siebach, co-author of a study published online in Earth and Planetary Science Letters. “Tridymite is usually associated with quartz-forming, explosive, evolved volcanic systems on Earth, but we found it in the bottom of an ancient lake on Mars, where most of the volcanoes are very primitive.” Siebach, an assistant professor in Rice’s Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences, is a mission specialist on NASA’s Curiosity team. To suss out the answer to the mystery, she partnered with two postdoctoral researchers in her Rice research group, Valerie Payré and Michael Thorpe, NASA’s Elizabeth Rampe and Caltech’s Paula Antoshechkina. Payré, the study’s lead author, is now at Northern Arizona University and preparing to join the faculty of the University of Iowa in the fall."</em> <a href="https://news.rice.edu/news/2022/study-explosive-volcanic-eruption-produced-rare-mineral-mars">[...]</a>

While doing a routine check on a batch of tiny gold tetrahedrons, Rice chemist Matthew Jones and graduate student Zhihua Cheng found their microscopic particles had the unanticipated ability to arrange themselves into 2D chiral superstructures. The discovery, which is detailed in a new study in Nature Communications, is likely the first-known spontaneous self-assembly of a planar chiral structure, Jones said. Chiral structures are mirror opposites, similar forms, like right and left hands, that can’t be superimposed on one another. It’s an important distinction in drug design, where chiral molecules may be therapeutic in one handedness and toxic in the other. Tetrahedrons themselves are not chiral — that is, they can be superimposed on their mirror images."</em> <a href="https://news.rice.edu/news/2022/tetrahedrons-assemble-three-sided-pyramids-form-2d-structures">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Quantum clocks are shrinking, thanks to new technologies developed at the University of Birmingham-led UK Quantum Technology Hub Sensors and Timing. Working in collaboration with and partly funded by the UK’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl), a team of quantum physicists have devised new approaches that not only reduce the size of their clock, but also make it robust enough to be transported out of the laboratory and employed in the ‘real world’. Quantum – or atomic – clocks are widely seen as essential for increasingly precise approaches to areas such as online communications across the world, navigation systems, or global trading in stocks, where fractions of seconds could make a huge economic difference. Atomic clocks with optical clock frequencies can be 10,000 times more accurate than their microwave counterparts, opening up the possibility of redefining the standard (SI) unit of measurement. Even more advanced optical clocks could one day make a significant difference both in everyday life and in fundamental science. By allowing longer periods between needing to resynchronise than other kinds of clock, they offer increased resilience for national timing infrastructure and unlock future positioning and navigation applications for autonomous vehicles."</em> <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/2022/next-generation-atomic-clocks-are-a-step-closer-to-real-world-applications">[...]</a>

By tracking tiny magnetic moments known as “spins” on the honeycomb lattice of a layered iron trichloride magnet, the team found the first 2D system to host a spiral spin liquid. The discovery provides a test bed for future studies of physics phenomena that may drive next-generation information technologies. These include fractons, or collective quantized vibrations that may prove promising in quantum computing, and skyrmions, or novel magnetic spin textures that could advance high-density data storage. “Materials hosting spiral spin liquids are particularly exciting due to their potential to be used to generate quantum spin liquids, spin textures and fracton excitations,” said ORNL’s Shang Gao, who led the study published in Physical Review Letters.

<p><em>"By subjecting a quantum computer’s qubits to quasi-rhythmic laser pulses based on the Fibonacci sequence, physicists demonstrated a way of storing quantum information that is less prone to errors. By shining a laser pulse sequence inspired by the Fibonacci numbers at atoms inside a quantum computer, physicists have created a remarkable, never-before-seen phase of matter. The phase has the benefits of two time dimensions despite there still being only one singular flow of time, the physicists report July 20 in Nature. This mind-bending property offers a sought-after benefit: Information stored in the phase is far more protected against errors than with alternative setups currently used in quantum computers. As a result, the information can exist without getting garbled for much longer, an important milestone for making quantum computing viable, says study lead author Philipp Dumitrescu. The approach’s use of an “extra” time dimension “is a completely different way of thinking about phases of matter,” says Dumitrescu, who worked on the project as a research fellow at the Flatiron Institute’s Center for Computational Quantum Physics in New York City."</em> <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/2022/07/20/strange-new-phase-of-matter-created-in-quantum-computer-acts-like-it-has-two-time-dimensions/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A dense, collapsed star spinning at 707 times per second—making it one of the fastest spinning neutron stars in the Milky Way galaxy—has shredded and consumed nearly the entire mass of its stellar companion and, in the process, grown into the heaviest neutron star observed to date. Weighing this record-setting neutron star, which tops the charts at 2.35 times the mass of the sun, helps astronomers understand the weird quantum state of matter inside these dense objects, which — if they get much heavier than that—collapse entirely and disappear as a black hole. “We know roughly how matter behaves at nuclear densities, like in the nucleus of a uranium atom,” said Alex Filippenko, Distinguished Professor of Astronomy at the University of California, Berkeley. “A neutron star is like one giant nucleus, but when you have one-and-a-half solar masses of this stuff, which is about 500,000 Earth masses of nuclei all clinging together, it’s not at all clear how they will behave.” Roger W. Romani, professor of astrophysics at Stanford University, noted that neutron stars are so dense—1 cubic inch weighs over 10 billion tons—that their cores are the densest matter in the universe short of black holes, which because they are hidden behind their event horizon are impossible to study. The neutron star, a pulsar designated PSR J0952-0607, is thus the densest object within sight of Earth. The measurement of the neutron star’s mass was possible thanks to the extreme sensitivity of the 10-meter Keck I telescope on Maunakea in Hawai’i, which was just able to record a spectrum of visible light from the hotly glowing companion star, now reduced to the size of a large gaseous planet."</em> <a href="https://humsci.stanford.edu/feature/heaviest-neutron-star-date-black-widow-eating-its-mate">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) have found a way to build powerful magnets smaller than before, aiding the design and construction of machines that could help the world harness the power of the sun to create electricity without producing greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. The scientists found a way to build high-temperature superconducting magnets that are made of material that conducts electricity with little or no resistance at temperatures warmer than before. Such powerful magnets would more easily fit within the tight space inside spherical tokamaks, which are shaped more like a cored apple than the doughnut-like shape of conventional tokamaks, and are being explored as a possible design for future fusion power plants. Since the magnets could be positioned apart from other machinery in the spherical tokamak’s central cavity to corral the hot plasma that fuels fusion reactions, researchers could repair them without having to take anything else apart. “To do this, you need a magnet with a stronger magnetic field and a smaller size than current magnets,” said Yuhu Zhai, a principal engineer at PPPL and lead author of a paper reporting the results in IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity. “The only way you do that is with superconducting wires, and that’s what we’ve done.” Fusion, the power that drives the sun and stars, combines light elements in the form of plasma — the hot, charged state of matter composed of free electrons and atomic nuclei — that generates massive amounts of energy."</em> <a href="https://www.pppl.gov/news/2022/smaller-stronger-magnets-could-improve-devices-harness-fusion-power-sun-and-stars">[...]</a>

Motivation We eventually got tired of the generic solar recharged lawn lights that light the edge of our driveway at night (they all eventually fail) and replaced them with a string of mains powered LED lights. Now we needed a sunset driven switch to automatically turn them on for a few hours after sunset every day. Time for some Wemos D1 Mini love and some overkill."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/michael-cartwright/sunset-switch-overkill-2f5ece">[...]</a>

It had two serious vulnerabilities: 1) Absence of the integrity verification feature; 2) Receiver's vulnerability to the replay attack. I've fixed these vulnerabilities in this version of the Cipherbox, which of course, in no way made the Cipherbox perfect, but at least it's a bit better now. If you missed the previous tutorial, let me remind you that Cipherbox is what I consider to be a cryptographic swiss knife. It utilizes six encryption algorithms, and it's also a vault that's locked with four RFID cards, your username, and password."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Cipherbox-V20/">[...]</a>
