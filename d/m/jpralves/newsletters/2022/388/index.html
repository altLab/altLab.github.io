<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1735, o pioneiro britânico <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Ramsden">Jesse Ramsden</a>. Ele concebeu diversas de ferramentas de precisão. Aos 23 anos, Ramsden optou por aprender a fazer instrumentos matemáticos. Aos 27 anos de idade tinha o seu próprio negócio em Londres e era conhecido como o desenhador mais hábil de instrumentos matemáticos, astronómicos, de topografia e de navegação do século XVIII. É mais conhecido pelo design de um telescópio e de um microscópio (ocular) ainda hoje comummente utilizado e com o seu nome. O cientista francês N. Cassegrain propôs o desenho de um telescópio reflector em 1672. Foi Ramsden, contudo, 100 anos mais tarde, que descobriu que este desenho reduz o embaçamento da imagem causado pela esfericidade das lentes ou espelhos. Também construiu tornos, barómetros, manómetros e balanços de ensaio.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1831, o matemático alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dedekind">Richard Dedekind</a>. Ele desenvolveu uma grande redefinição de números irracionais em termos de conceitos aritméticos. Embora não tenha sido plenamente reconhecido na sua vida, o seu tratamento das ideias do infinito e do que constitui um número real continua a influenciar a matemática moderna.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1846, o engenheiro, inventor e industrial americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Westinghouse">George Westinghouse</a>. Ele fundou a sua própria empresa para fabricar a sua invenção, o travão de ar. Filho de um fabricante de máquinas agrícolas de Nova Iorque, começou aos 21 anos de idade a trabalhar numa nova ferramenta que inventou para guiar vagões de comboio descarrilados de volta à via. Antes de morrer 46 anos mais tarde, produzia transporte ferroviário mais seguro, turbinas a vapor, iluminação e aquecimento a gás, e electricidade. Fundou não só os nomes Westinghouse Air Brake e Westinghouse Electric, mas também Union Switch &amp; Signal e os precursores de Duquesne Light, Equitable Gas e Rockwell International. Foi também o principal responsável pela adopção de corrente alternada para transmissão de energia eléctrica nos Estados Unidos, e detinha 400 patentes.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1866, o físico, engenheiro e inventor canadiano-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reginald_Fessenden">Reginald Fessenden</a>. Ele transmitiu o primeiro programa de voz e música. Em 1893, Fessenden mudou-se para Pittsburgh como chefe de engenharia eléctrica na universidade, Fessenden leu sobre o trabalho de Marconi e começou a fazer experiências com ele próprio. Marconi só conseguia transmitir o código Morse. Mas o objectivo de Fessenden era transmitir a voz humana e a música. Ele inventou a rádio AM "onda contínua": som sobreposto pela modulação de amplitude a uma onda de rádio portadora para transmissão. Um receptor de rádio extrai o sinal da onda portadora para que o ouvinte ouça o som original. Fessenden fez as primeiras transmissões de voz de longo alcance na véspera de Natal de 1906 a partir de uma estação em Brant Rock, Massachusetts, ouviu centenas de quilómetros no Atlântico.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1903, o físico irlandês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Walton">Ernest Walton</a>. Ele recebeu, com Sir John Douglas Cockcroft da Inglaterra, o Prémio Nobel da Física de 1951 pelo desenvolvimento do primeiro acelerador de partículas nucleares, conhecido como o gerador Cockcroft-Walton. O acelerador foi construído numa sala em desuso no Laboratório Cavendish, e fornecido com várias centenas de quilovolts de um circuito multiplicador de voltagem concebido e construído por Cockroft e Walton. A 14 de Abril de 1932 Walton ligou o feixe de protões a um alvo de lítio. Apesar de todas as probabilidades contra eles, conseguiram ser os primeiros a dividir o átomo, e Walton foi o primeiro a ver a reacção a ter lugar. Eles identificaram os produtos de desintegração como partículas alfa (núcleos de hélio).</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou na sequência da aprovação do Parlamento, os consumidores da UE poderão em breve utilizar uma única solução de carregamento para os seus dispositivos electrónicos. Até ao final de 2024, todos os telemóveis, tablets e câmaras fotográficas vendidos na UE terão de estar equipados com uma porta USB de carregamento tipo C. A partir da Primavera de 2026, a obrigação estender-se-á aos computadores portáteis. A nova lei, aprovada pelo plenário na terça-feira com 602 votos a favor, 13 contra e 8 abstenções, faz parte de um esforço mais amplo da UE para reduzir o lixo electrónico e para capacitar os consumidores a fazerem escolhas mais sustentáveis.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou a versão final do Linux 6.0 inicia a série 6.x na sua forma mais fina, trazendo um conjunto de melhorias de desempenho, novo suporte de hardware, correcções de segurança, e o habitual saco de agarramento de ajustes no sistema de ficheiros. Anunciando o lançamento na Linux Kernel Mailing List, Linus Torvalds disse: "Como se espera que seja claro para todos, a grande alteração do número de versões é mais sobre eu ficar sem dedos dos pés e das mãos do que sobre quaisquer grandes mudanças fundamentais". De entre as novidades temos suporte de Kernel para autenticação NVMe in-band, Subsistema de verificação em runtime, Driver kernel do Raspberry Pi 4 V3D, IO_uring em user-space, escritas bufferizadas em filesystem XFS, suporte para o protocolo Send v2 do filesystem Btrfs, H.265/HEVC API promovida a estável.</p>

<p>Por fim, esta semana que passou o CEO da Tesla, Elon Musk, revelou um protótipo de um robô humanóide "Optimus" que partilha algum software e sensores de IA com as características de assistência ao condutor dos seus automóveis Autopilot. No início da apresentação do Dia da IA de Tesla 2022, Musk reconheceu que tinha "um tipo de fato" no ano passado, mas prometeu algo muito mais impressionante hoje. Segundo Musk, este protótipo pode fazer mais do que aquilo que foi mostrado ao vivo, mas "a primeira vez que funcionou sem uma corda foi esta noite no palco". Musk previu que poderia atingir um preço "provavelmente inferior a 20.000 dólares" e mais tarde, numa sessão de perguntas e respostas, explicou que Tesla é muito bom na construção da IA e dos actuadores necessários para a robótica, com base na experiência de produzir unidades de accionamento para carros eléctricos. Musk disse que isso a ajudaria a colocar robôs capazes na produção e a começar por testá-los dentro das suas fábricas.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker e alguns vídeos interessantes.</p>

<p><em>"Following Parliament’s approval, EU consumers will soon be able to use a single charging solution for their electronic devices. By the end of 2024, all mobile phones, tablets and cameras sold in the EU will have to be equipped with a USB Type-C charging port. From spring 2026, the obligation will extend to laptops. The new law, adopted by plenary on Tuesday with 602 votes in favour, 13 against and 8 abstentions, is part of a broader EU effort to reduce e-waste and to empower consumers to make more sustainable choices. Under the new rules, consumers will no longer need a different charger every time they purchase a new device, as they will be able to use one single charger for a whole range of small and medium-sized portable electronic devices. Regardless of their manufacturer, all new mobile phones, tablets, digital cameras, headphones and headsets, handheld videogame consoles and portable speakers, e-readers, keyboards, mice, portable navigation systems, earbuds and laptops that are rechargeable via a wired cable, operating with a power delivery of up to 100 Watts, will have to be equipped with a USB Type-C port."</em> <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220930IPR41928/long-awaited-common-charger-for-mobile-devices-will-be-a-reality-in-2024">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2022/10/linux-kernel-6-released-new-features">Linux Kernel 6.0 Released, This is What’s New</a></h2>

<p><em>"Linux 6.0 kickstarts the 6.x series in fine form, bringing an assortment of performance improvements, new hardware support, security fixes, and the usual grab-bag of file-system tweaks to the fore. Announcing the release over on the Linux Kernel Mailing List, Linus Torvalds said: “As is hopefully clear to everybody, the major version number change is more about me running out of fingers and toes than it is about any big fundamental changes.” “But of course there’s a lot of various changes in 6.0 – we’ve got over 15k non-merge commits in there in total, after all, and as such 6.0 is one of the bigger releases at least in numbers of commits in a while. For a pinch more detail on what’s new in Linux kernel 6.0, read on. Benchmarking done by Phoronix reveals appreciable performance improvements across Intel Xeon ‘Ice Lake’, AMD Ryzen ‘Threadripper’, and AMD EPYC processors thanks to scheduler changes and other kernel energy tweaks. Seeing Linux squeeze more power while using less power is always a welcome one. Linux 6.0 also does some mandatory future-proofing by laying groundwork for swathes of upcoming hardware."</em> <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2022/10/linux-kernel-6-released-new-features">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed a prototype of a humanoid "Optimus" robot that shares some AI software and sensors with its cars' Autopilot driver assistance features. At the start of Tesla's 2022 AI Day presentation, Musk acknowledged that they had "a guy in a suit" last year but promised something much more impressive today. According to Musk, this prototype can do more than what was shown live, but "the first time it operated without a tether was tonight on stage." Musk predicted it could hit a price of "probably less than $20,000" and later, in a Q&amp;A session, explained that Tesla is very good at building the AI and the actuators necessary for robotics based on the experience of producing drive units for electric cars. Musk said that would help it get capable robots into production and start off by testing them within its factories. He claimed that the difference between Tesla's design and other "very impressive humanoid robot demonstrations" is that Tesla's Optimus is made for mass production in the "millions" of units and to be very capable."</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/30/23374729/tesla-bot-ai-day-robot-elon-musk-prototype-optimus-humanoid">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Observations from the spacecraft’s pass of the moon provided the first close-up in over two decades of this ocean world, resulting in remarkable imagery and unique science. The highest-resolution photo NASA’s Juno mission has ever taken of a specific portion of Jupiter’s moon Europa reveals a detailed view of a puzzling region of the moon’s heavily fractured icy crust. The image covers about 93 miles (150 kilometers) by 125 miles (200 kilometers) of Europa’s surface, revealing a region crisscrossed with a network of fine grooves and double ridges (pairs of long parallel lines indicating elevated features in the ice). Near the upper right of the image, as well as just to the right and below center, are dark stains possibly linked to something from below erupting onto the surface. Below center and to the right is a surface feature that recalls a musical quarter note, measuring 42 miles (67 kilometers) north-south by 23 miles (37 kilometers) east-west. The white dots in the image are signatures of penetrating high-energy particles from the severe radiation environment around the moon."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-juno-gets-highest-resolution-close-up-of-jupiters-moon-europa">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The Intel Labs and Components Research organizations have demonstrated the industry’s highest reported yield and uniformity to date of silicon spin qubit devices developed at Intel’s transistor research and development facility, Gordon Moore Park at Ronler Acres in Hillsboro, Oregon. This achievement represents a major milestone for scaling and working toward fabricating quantum chips on Intel’s transistor manufacturing processes. The research was conducted using Intel’s second-generation silicon spin test chip. Through testing the devices using the Intel cryoprober, a quantum dot testing device that operates at cryogenic temperatures (1.7 Kelvin or -271.45 degrees Celsius), the team isolated 12 quantum dots and four sensors. This result represents the industry’s largest silicon electron spin device with a single electron in each location across an entire 300 millimeter silicon wafer. Today’s silicon spin qubits are typically presented on one device, whereas Intel’s research demonstrates success across an entire wafer."</em> <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-hits-key-milestone-quantum-chip-research.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"STMicroelectronics has introduced the latest generation of its automotive-qualified NFC reader ICs for Car Connectivity Consortium (CCC) digital-key applications, with enhanced features that increase performance and ease product certification. The ST25R3920B is used in car-door and center-console locations for keyless entry and starting, as well as Qi wireless-charging control and smartphone pairing. The chip comes with ST’s unique Heartbeat algorithm for NFC card protection on Wireless Power Consortium (WPC) applications, which can differentiate between an NFC card and a smartphone in card-emulation mode. This ensures phones can charge while cards stay protected. Additional new features include enhanced Active Wave Shaping (AWS) to ease certification according to the latest NFC Forum Certification Release 13 (CR13), which also promotes interoperability between CCC digital-key solutions and smartphones. AWS helps remove undershoot and overshoot from the received signal by adjusting parameters and hence avoids repeatedly rematching the antenna during development."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4485.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"STMicroelectronics (NYSE: STM), a global semiconductor leader serving customers across the spectrum of electronics applications, is enabling more acoustically comfortable cars, with its new sensor for road-noise cancellation (RNC) through active noise-control (ANC) techniques. Cars have traditionally been defined by engine performance, exterior design, and powertrains, but drivers and passengers are increasingly focused on comfort. Indeed, while Electric Vehicles (EV) are intrinsically less noisy than internal combustion engine cars (ICE), car makers are focused on further lowering in-cabin noise due to wheel or vibration. These efforts aim to allow passenger to better enjoy the journey in a quieter ambient environment. Noise cancellation algorithms, working with an array of sensors installed throughout the vehicle, measure the ambient sounds, and eliminate vibration using noise-cancelling waveforms that act as anti-vibration (cancelling) sounds. “In today’s digital age, canceling – not deadening – unwanted sounds is the smart way to ensure a quieter cabin for safer, more enjoyable journeys,” said Simone Ferri, MEMS Sub-Group General Manager of Marketing, Analog, MEMS and Sensors Group, STMicroelectronics."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/p4486.html">[...]</a>

A POSTECH research team led by Professor Soojin Park and PhD candidate Sungjin Cho (Department of Chemistry) in collaboration with Professor Dong-Hwa Seo and Dr. Dong Yeon Kim (School of Energy and Chemical Engineering) at Ulsan Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) have developed anode-free lithium batteries with performance of long battery life on a single charge."</em> <a href="https://postech.ac.kr/eng/the-battery-that-runs-630-km-on-a-single-charge/?pageds=1&amp;k=&amp;c=">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/new-algorithms-help-four-legged-robots-run-in-the-wild">New Algorithms Help Four-Legged Robots Run in the Wild</a></h2>

<p><em>"Ateam led by the University of California San Diego has developed a new system of algorithms that enables four-legged robots to walk and run on challenging terrain while avoiding both static and moving obstacles. In tests, the system guided a robot to maneuver autonomously and swiftly across sandy surfaces, gravel, grass, and bumpy dirt hills covered with branches and fallen leaves without bumping into poles, trees, shrubs, boulders, benches or people. The robot also navigated a busy office space without bumping into boxes, desks or chairs. The work brings researchers a step closer to building robots that can perform search and rescue missions or collect information in places that are too dangerous or difficult for humans. The team will present its work at the 2022 International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), which will take place from Oct. 23 to 27 in Kyoto, Japan. The system provides a legged robot more versatility because of the way it combines the robot’s sense of sight with another sensing modality called proprioception, which involves the robot’s sense of movement, direction, speed, location and touch—in this case, the feel of the ground beneath its feet."</em> <a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/new-algorithms-help-four-legged-robots-run-in-the-wild">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Galaxies, including our Milky Way, host supermassive black holes in their centers, and their masses are millions to billions of times larger than the Sun. Some supermassive black holes launch fast-moving plasma outflows which emit strong radio signals, known as radio jets. Radio jets were first discovered in the 1970s. But much remains unknown about how they are produced, especially their energy source and plasma loading mechanism. Recently, the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration uncovered radio images of a nearby black hole at the center of the giant elliptical galaxy M87. The observation supported the theory that the spin of the black hole powers radio jets but did little to clarify the plasma loading mechanism."</em> <a href="http://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/press/exploring_plasma_loading_mechanisms_of_radio_jets.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://chbe.illinois.edu/news/stories/plastic-upcycling-JACS-2022">Scientists crack upcycling plastics to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, advancing a recent Science study</a></h2>

<p><em>"Scientists from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, University of California, Santa Barbara, and Dow have developed a breakthrough process to transform the most widely produced plastic — polyethylene (PE) — into the second-most widely produced plastic, polypropylene (PP), which could reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). “The world needs more and better options for extracting the energy and molecular value from its waste plastics,” said co-lead author Susannah Scott, Distinguished Professor and Mellichamp Chair of Sustainable Catalytic Processing at UC Santa Barbara. Conventional plastic recycling methods result in low-value plastic molecules and, thus, offer little incentive to recycle the mountains of plastic waste that have accumulated over the past several decades. But, Scott added, “turning polyethylene into propylene, which can then be used to make a new polymer, is how we start to build a circular economy for plastics.” “We started by conceptualizing this approach and demonstrated its promise first through theoretical modeling — now we have proved that it can be done experimentally in a way that is scalable and potentially applicable to current industry demands,” said co-lead author Damien Guironnet, a professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at Illinois, who published the first study outlining the necessary catalytic reactions in 2020 with Illinois professor Baron Peters. The new study published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society announces a series of coupled catalytic reactions that transform PE, which is #2 and #4 plastic that make up 29% of the world’s plastic consumption, into the building block propylene that is the key ingredient to produce PP, also known as #5 plastic that accounts for close to 25% of the world’s plastic consumption. This study establishes a proof-of-concept for upcycling PE plastic with more than 95% selectivity into propylene."</em> <a href="https://chbe.illinois.edu/news/stories/plastic-upcycling-JACS-2022">[...]</a>

In the development history of human society, data storage plays an indispensable and pivotal role and has significantly boosted spacious domains from social science to industrial production. With the advent of the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence, the total amount of information has doubled biennially, and it will reach 175 ZB (1 ZB = 1012 GB) by 2025 according to the valuation by International Data Corporation. However, accounting for 80% of the total stored data generated by the government, data disaster recovery centers, and archives are not frequently accessed but still need to be available over long periods in a reliable and low-cost way. However, the existing storage technologies (semiconductor or magnetic-based storage) cannot cope with long-term storage of large amounts of cold data due to the problems such as huge energy consumption, limited lifetime, and low storage density. According to the report by the International Data Center Service provider, the energy consumption of modern data centers will soon exceed 8% of the total global power generation."</em> <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/966218">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Devin Carroll, a doctoral candidate in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, is designing a modular robot called StickBot, which may be adapted for rehabilitation use in global public health settings. In late summer, just as the leaves were starting to crisp and curl in the heat, Devin Carroll walked out of his apartment, looked on the ground, and picked up a couple of sticks that he thought might work for his robot. About half an inch thick and the length of an adult hand, he stripped the three sticks of their bark and lashed them with string to StickBot, a modular robot composed of circuitry, actuators, a microcontroller, and a motor driver. Powered by four AA batteries, connected by a maze of wires and blinking lights, StickBot’s wooden arms now thump up and over, powering the robot across the table at Penn’s General Robotics, Automation, Sensing &amp; Perception (GRASP) Lab, where Carroll is a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Controlling the robot using an app he designed, Carroll shows how StickBot can pivot from using the sticks as legs in “crawler mode,” to using them as arms. In “grasper mode,” the sticks are attached to a controller plate on one side to form a hinge joint while moving with their free end to hold a cup upright."</em> <a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/grasp-lab-stickbot-robot-made-sticks">[...]</a>

The RatPack functions through the use of an accelerometer embedded in a vest that the animals wear. The accelerometer monitors the animal's body motion. Changes in the animal's body motion are monitored in real-time by an embedded machine learning processor that detects when the animal makes certain gestures it has previously been trained to make in response to detecting a scent or object.
