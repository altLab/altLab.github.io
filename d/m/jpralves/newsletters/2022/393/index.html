<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1764, o mineralogista hispano-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9s_Manuel_del_R%C3%ADo">Andrés Manuel del Río</a>. Ele descobriu (1801) um novo elemento, mais tarde chamado vanadium. Enquanto professor de mineralogia no México, Del Rio examinou uma amostra de chumbo castanho de Zimapan e encontrou um novo metal, semelhante ao crómio e urânio, ao qual deu o nome de eritrónio, após a cor vermelha de um dos seus compostos químicos (eritrónio grego, "vermelho"). Foi dissuadido por outros químicos, e acabou por considerá-lo como crómio impuro. O químico sueco Nils Gabriel Sefström, redescobriu o elemento (1830) e deu-lhe o nome de vanádio, depois de Vanadis, a deusa escandinava da beleza, por causa dos seus belos compostos multicoloridos. Desde o início do século XIX, o vanádio tem sido utilizado como elemento de liga para aços e ferro.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1810, o engenheiro sanitário e canalizador inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Jennings">George Jennings</a>. Ele inventou os primeiros autoclismos públicos. Jennings especializou-se na concepção de sanitários que fossem "o armário sanitário mais perfeito que se possa fazer". No entanto, também se destacou em projectos de saneamento público, tais como a concepção da "conveniência pública" subterrânea. As entradas para estes eram elaboradas grades metálicas e arcos iluminados por lâmpadas, com interiores construídos em ardósia e, mais tarde, em azulejos de cerâmica.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1855, o fabricante automóvel francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandre_Darracq">Alexandre Darracq</a>. Ele foi um dos primeiros a planear a produção em massa de veículos automóveis. Darracq começou a fabricar máquinas de costura e fundou a empresa Gladiator Cycle em 1891, fabricando as motocicletas Millet. Em finais da década de 1890, em França, recorreu aos automóveis. Mais tarde, Darracq fabricou carros eléctricos e bicicletas Millet motorizadas. Começou a produzir Léon Bollée voiturettes (1898), depois produziu automóveis de qualidade sob as marcas Darracq, Talbot-Darracq,e Talbot, nomeadamente a Darracq Flying Fifteen (1904). Também construiu automóveis de corrida e dirigiu uma escola para pilotos de corrida. Em 1904 Darracq foi o fabricante de automóveis de maior sucesso no mundo, produzindo 1600 veículos. A fábrica da filial italiana foi a origem da Alfa Romeo. Ele nunca aprendeu a conduzir.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1861, o astrónomo escocês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_T._A._Innes">Robert Innes</a>. Ele descobriu Proxima Centauri (1915), a estrela mais próxima da Terra depois do Sol. Convidado por David Gill para o Observatório do Cabo, África do Sul (1894), tornou-se um observador binário bem sucedido com o refractor de 7 polegadas (1628 descobertas). A sua descoberta mais famosa, Proxima Centauri é uma estrela fraca perto da estrela binária Alfa Centauri, que está tão longe do sul que não é visível da maior parte do hemisfério norte. Foi também o primeiro a ver o cometa da luz do dia de 1910, embora este cometa tenha sido encontrado independentemente por tantas pessoas no hemisfério sul que nenhum "original" descobridor pôde ser nomeado. Innes registou-o a 17 de Janeiro de 1910.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1895, o designer de aviões norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Northrop">Jack Northrop</a>. Ele foi um dos primeiros defensores da construção totalmente metálica e do desenho das asas voadoras. Já em 1923, Jack Northrop tinha sido convencido de que a asa voadora, na qual a aeronave transportava todas as cargas e controlos dentro da asa e não tinha fuselagem nem secções de cauda, era o próximo grande passo em frente na concepção de aeronaves. Durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial, ele perseguiu vários projectos de aeronaves de asa voadora. Nas décadas que se seguiram à guerra, o nome de Northrop foi anexado como fabricante e projectista de várias outras aeronaves, culminando no B-2, que justificava o sonho de Jack Northrop de uma máquina voadora limpa.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1918, o químico teórico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Otto_Fischer">Ernst Otto Fischer</a>. Ele foi co-recipiente (com o cientista britânico Geoffrey Wilkinson) do Prémio Nobel da Química em 1973 pela sua identificação de uma forma completamente nova em que os metais e as substâncias orgânicas se podem combinar. Fischer conheceu pela primeira vez o recém-sintetizado composto organometálico chamado ferroceno ao ler sobre o mesmo em 1951. Como nessa altura a sua estrutura era desconhecida, Fischer estudou-o, e determinou que consistia num único átomo de ferro ensanduichado entre dois anéis de carbono de cinco lados. Wilkinson fez esta mesma descoberta de forma independente de Fischer.</p>

<p>Em 1974, a descoberta da partícula subatómica "charmed quark" foi anunciada simultaneamente pelos dois grupos experimentais americanos responsáveis. Um era um grupo MIT no Laboratório Nacional de Brookhaven, e o outro um grupo SLAC-Berkeley na costa ocidental, no centro de aceleradores Linear de Stanford. A nova partícula, de massa 3095 MeV teve uma vida útil cerca de 1000 vezes mais longa do que a de outras partículas de massa comparável. Este anúncio incendiou o mundo da física de alta energia e é agora conhecido na comunidade da física como a revolução de Novembro. Em dois anos, em 1976, os cientistas que lideravam esses grupos, Samuel Ting e Burton Richter, receberam o Prémio Nobel da Física.</p>

<p>Em 1983, o estudante americano Fred Cohen apresentou num seminário de segurança os resultados do seu teste - o primeiro vírus documentado, criado como uma experiência em segurança informática. Cohen criou este primeiro vírus ao estudar para um doutoramento na Universidade da Califórnia do Sul. Outros tinham escrito sobre o potencial de criação de programas perniciosos, mas ele foi o primeiro a demonstrar um exemplo de trabalho. No jornal, ele definiu um vírus como "um programa que pode 'infectar' outros programas, modificando-os para incluir uma ... versão de si mesmo". Cohen adicionou o seu vírus a um programa gráfico chamado VD, escrito para um mini-computador Vax. O vírus escondeu-se dentro do VD e utilizou as permissões que os utilizadores tinham de olhar para outras partes do computador Vax para se espalharem pelo sistema.</p>

<p><em>"Samsung’s eighth-generation V-NAND features both the industry’s highest storage capacity and highest bit density to enable expanded storage space in next-generation servers Samsung Electronics, the world leader in advanced memory technology, as promised at Flash Memory Summit 2022 and Samsung Memory Tech Day 2022, announced today that it has begun mass producing a 1-terabit (Tb) triple-level cell (TLC) eighth-generation Vertical NAND (V-NAND) with the industry’s highest bit density. At 1Tb, the new V-NAND also features the highest storage capacity to date, enabling larger storage space in next-generation enterprise server systems worldwide. “As market demand for denser, greater-capacity storage pushes for higher V-NAND layer counts, Samsung has adopted its advanced 3D scaling technology to reduce surface area and height, while avoiding the cell-to-cell interference that normally occurs with scaling down,” said SungHoi Hur, Executive Vice President of Flash Product &amp; Technology at Samsung Electronics. “Our eighth-generation V-NAND will help meet rapidly growing market demand and better position us to deliver more differentiated products and solutions, which will be at the very foundation of future storage innovations.” Samsung was able to attain the industry’s highest bit density by significantly enhancing the bit productivity per wafer. Based on the Toggle DDR 5.0 interface* — the latest NAND flash standard — Samsung’s eighth-generation V-NAND features an input and output (I/O) speed of up to 2.4 gigabits per second (Gbps), a 1.2X boost over the previous generation. This will enable the new V-NAND to accommodate the performance requirements of PCIe 4.0, and later, PCIe 5.0."</em> <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-begins-mass-production-of-8th-gen-vertical-nand-with-industrys-highest-bit-density">[...]</a>

Black holes are the most extreme objects in the universe, packing so much mass into so little space that nothing – not even light – can escape their gravitational pull once it gets close enough. Understanding black holes is key to unravelling the most fundamental laws governing the cosmos, because they represent the limits of two of the best-tested theories of physics: the theory of general relativity, which describes gravity as resulting from the (large-scale) warping of spacetime by massive objects, and the theory of quantum mechanics, which describes physics at the smallest length scales. To fully describe black holes, we would need to stitch these two theories together and form a theory of quantum gravity. Radiating black holes To achieve this goal, we might want to look at what manages to escape from black holes, rather than what gets swallowed. The event horizon is an intangible boundary around each black hole, beyond which there is no way of getting out."</em> <a href="https://www.uva.nl/en/shared-content/subsites/institute-of-physics/en/news/2022/11/synthetic-black-holes-radiate-like-real-ones.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Pacemakers and other medical devices, as well as long-distance drones and remote sensors, could require fewer battery replacements with new approach. For the last few decades, battery research has largely focused on rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, which are used in everything from electric cars to portable electronics and have improved dramatically in terms of affordability and capacity. But nonrechargeable batteries have seen little improvement during that time, despite their crucial role in many important uses such as implantable medical devices like pacemakers. Now, researchers at MIT have come up with a way to improve the energy density of these nonrechargeable, or “primary,” batteries. They say it could enable up to a 50 percent increase in useful lifetime, or a corresponding decrease in size and weight for a given amount of power or energy capacity, while also improving safety, with little or no increase in cost. The new findings, which involve substituting the conventionally inactive battery electrolyte with a material that is active for energy delivery, are reported today in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, in a paper by MIT Kavanaugh Postdoctoral Fellow Haining Gao, graduate student Alejandro Sevilla, associate professor of mechanical engineering Betar Gallant, and four others at MIT and Caltech."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/nonrechargeable-batteries-electrolyte-1104">[...]</a>

<p><em>"VFD scalar inverter for single phase asynchronous motors (max 500W). The name is MST_K05VF SINGLE PHASE ASYNCRONUS MOTOR VFD INVERTER For applications with low power asynchronous motors, an inverter has been designed with the initials MST_K05VF. This is a VFD mini inverter with which you can regulate all asynchronous motors with powers up to 500W (just over 0.5Hp). It is particularly suitable for controlling fan motors (axial and tangential), pillar drills, asynchronous washing machine motors (old style). The regulation is of the scalar type with the V / F technique: the frequency F and the amplitude V of the power supply sinusoid are varied, keeping their ratio constant in order to keep the stator flux constant and therefore the torque of the motor. The architecture of the inverter is the same as that of the MST_KVF inverter."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/microst/single-phase-asynchronous-motors-vfd-mini-inverter-0e05f8">[...]</a>
