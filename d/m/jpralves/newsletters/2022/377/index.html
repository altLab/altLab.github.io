<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1620, o astrónomo, cartógrafo e engenheiro hidráulico francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Picard">Jean Picard</a>. Ele foi considerado como o fundador da astronomia moderna em França. Ele introduziu novos métodos, melhorou os instrumentos antigos, e acrescentou novos dispositivos, tais como o relógio pendular de Huygens para registar tempos e intervalos de tempo. Picard foi o primeiro a utilizar o telescópio para a medição precisa de pequenos ângulos, fazendo uso do micrómetro da Gascoigne. Concebeu um micrómetro de arame móvel para medir os diâmetros de objectos celestes como o Sol, a Lua e os planetas. Para levantamento e nivelamento do terreno, concebeu instrumentos que incorporavam o telescópio astronómico. Picard foi um dos primeiros a aplicar métodos científicos para a elaboração de mapas. Entre as suas outras competências encontrava-se a hidráulica; resolveu o problema de abastecimento de água às fontes de Versalhes. O seu trabalho mais importante foi a primeira medição da circunferência da terra. Utilizou o método de Eratóstenes, mas com maior precisão. Aumentou muito a precisão das medições da Terra, utilizando o método de triangulação de Snell (Mesure de la Terre, 1671). Estes dados foram utilizados por Newton na sua teoria gravitacional. O conceito por detrás dos sinais de néon começou em 1675, quando Picard observou um brilho num barómetro.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1694, o químico sueco <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Brandt">Georg Brandt</a>. Ele foi a primeira pessoa a descobrir um metal desconhecido na antiguidade, que isolou e a quem deu o nome de cobalto (1730). Publicou (1733) descobertas sobre a composição e solubilidade dos compostos de arsénico, tendo depois investigado o antimónio, o bismuto, o mercúrio e o zinco. O seu trabalho sobre métodos de produção de ácidos clorídrico, nítrico e sulfúrico foi publicado em 1741 e 1743. Brandt foi um dos primeiros químicos a forjar completamente a alquimia, e dedicou os seus últimos anos a expor processos alquímicos fraudulentos para a produção de ouro. Os antigos egípcios utilizavam pequenas quantidades de cobalto para tornar o seu vidro azul. O cobalto é adicionado ao aço para o tornar mais duro e ter um ponto de fusão mais elevado. Vestígios dele são encontrados na carne e produtos lácteos como a vitamina B-12.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1810, o químico e físico francês  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Victor_Regnault">Henri Victor Regnault</a>. Ele ficou conhecido pelo seu trabalho sobre as propriedades dos gases. O seu inestimável trabalho foi feito como hábil, minucioso e paciente experimentador na determinação do calor específico de sólidos, líquidos, gases, e as tensões de vapor de água e outros líquidos voláteis, bem como o seu calor latente a diferentes temperaturas. Corrigiu a lei de gases de Mariotte relativa à variação da densidade com a pressão, determinou os coeficientes de expansão do ar e outros gases, concebeu novos métodos de investigação e inventou instrumentos precisos. Duas leis que regem o calor específico dos gases têm o seu nome.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1882, o cientista e engenheiro norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_E._Ives">Herbert E. Ives</a>. Ele liderou o desenvolvimento dos sistemas de fac-símile e televisão na AT&amp;T na primeira metade do século XX. É mais conhecido pela experiência Ives-Stilwell de 1938, que confirmou directamente a dilatação temporal da relatividade especial, embora o próprio Ives não tenha aceite a relatividade especial, e tenha defendido uma interpretação alternativa dos resultados experimentais[3]. Ives tem sido descrito como "o oponente mais autoritário da relatividade nos Estados Unidos entre o final dos anos 30 e o início dos anos 50.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1923, o químico americano nascido no Canadá <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolph_A._Marcus">Rudolph A. Marcus</a>. Ele recebeu o Prémio Nobel da Química de 1992 pelo seu trabalho sobre a teoria das reacções de transferência de electrões em sistemas químicos. A teoria de Marcus descreve e faz previsões sobre fenómenos tão diversos como a fixação da energia da luz por plantas verdes (fotossíntese), metabolismo celular, produção fotoquímica de combustível, quimioluminescência ("luz fria"), a condutividade dos polímeros condutores eléctricos, corrosão, a metodologia da síntese e análise electroquímica, e muito mais.</p>

<p>Uma colaboração internacional de cientistas do Laboratório Nacional de Aceleradores Fermi do Departamento de Energia anunciou a 21 de Julho de 2000, a primeira prova directa da partícula subatómica chamada tau neutrino, o terceiro tipo de neutrino conhecido dos físicos de partículas. Eles relataram quatro casos de um neutrino interagindo com um núcleo atómico para produzir uma partícula carregada chamada tau lepton, a assinatura de um tau neutrino.</p>

<p>A 21 de Julho de 2011, o programa de vaivém espacial da NASA completa a sua missão final, e a 135ª, quando o vaivém Atlantis aterra no Kennedy Space Center na Florida. Durante os 30 anos de história do programa, os seus cinco vaivéns - Columbia, Challenger, Discovery, Atlantis e Endeavour - transportaram mais de 350 pessoas para o espaço e voaram mais de 500 milhões de milhas, e as tripulações do vaivém realizaram importantes pesquisas, prestaram assistência ao Telescópio Espacial Hubble e ajudaram na construção da Estação Espacial Internacional, entre outras actividades. A NASA retirou os vaivéns para se concentrar num programa de exploração do espaço profundo que poderia um dia enviar astronautas para os asteróides e Marte.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker e alguns vídeos interessantes.</p>

<p><em>"NASA will host a media teleconference at 11 a.m. EDT (8 a.m. PDT) on Wednesday, July 27, to discuss the architecture for its Mars Sample Return campaign. NASA and the ESA (European Space Agency) recently held a systems requirement review as part of the Mars Sample Return campaign’s conceptual design phase – a phase when the architecture is refined and solidified. The briefing will present the architecture proposal that is expected to be finalized in September 2022. The Mars Sample Return campaign may revolutionize humanity’s understanding of Mars by returning scientifically selected samples for study using the most sophisticated instruments around the world. This strategic partnership with ESA will be the first mission to return samples from another planet, including the first launch from the surface of another planet. The samples to be returned – currently being collected by Perseverance during its exploration of Jezero Crater, home to an ancient river delta – are thought to be the best opportunity to reveal the early evolution of Mars, including the potential for life."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasa-esa-to-discuss-mars-sample-return-mission">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Passive day cooling is a promising technology for the sustainable reduction of energy consumption. It avoids the heating up of buildings by solar radiation and dissipates accumulated heat without external energy consumption. Researchers at the University of Bayreuth have now created a test system with which the materials used for passive cooling can be reliably characterised and compared - regardless of weather conditions and environmental conditions. The measurement setup presented in "Cell Reports Physical Science" is the first step towards a standardised, globally applicable test system for comparing high-performance cooling materials. "Increasing fossil energy consumption worldwide is still contributing to global warming and is a major cause of the heating up of our cities. Cooling buildings during the day using passive cooling materials has great potential to establish itself as an effective tool for energy conservation."</em> <a href="https://www.uni-bayreuth.de/press-releases/cooling-materials">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In a new paper in PNAS, "Triplet-Pair Spin Signatures From Macroscopically Aligned Heteroacenes in an Oriented Single Crystal," National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) researchers Brandon Rugg, Brian Fluegel, Christopher Chang, and Justin Johnson tackle one of the fundamental problems in quantum information science: how to produce pure elements of quantum information—that is, those that start and remain in a well-defined "spin state"—at practical temperatures. Quantum information science has the potential to revolutionize computation, sensing, and communications. But many of these applications are still beyond reach because of the challenges of producing units of quantum information, or qubits, without relying on extremely low temperatures to maintain their purity. Current approaches to identifying suitable quantum materials tend to rely on trial and error. "The field of developing new molecules and materials [for quantum information science] sometimes progresses through ad hoc methods and serendipity. 'This material just so happens to work better than the other one'—we saw a lot of that happening, and decided ultimately that it was not going to suffice for a project where the goal was to limit the set of possible options," said Justin Johnson, a researcher in NREL's Chemistry and Nanoscience Center."</em> <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/news/program/2022/nrel-researchers-create-order-from-quantum-chaos.html">[...]</a>

Silicon is one of the most abundant elements on Earth, and in its pure form the material has become the foundation of much of modern technology, from solar cells to computer chips. But silicon’s properties as a semiconductor are far from ideal. For one thing, although silicon lets electrons whizz through its structure easily, it is much less accommodating to “holes” — electrons’ positively charged counterparts — and harnessing both is important for some kinds of chips. What’s more, silicon is not very good at conducting heat, which is why overheating issues and expensive cooling systems are common in computers."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/best-semiconductor-them-all-0721">[...]</a>

Now researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have devised a way to make unprecedented improvements in the technique. Flow cytometry typically entails marking cells with fluorescent material, shining laser light on them as they cross one particular point in a fluid channel about the size of a human hair — narrow enough that the cells generally move in single file — and recording the light emitted by the markers on the cell. Analyzing the emissions reveals various characteristics such as cell type, size, DNA content, and stage in the cell-division cycle. But the conventional single-measurement method lacks a means to quantify the variations in its readings. For example, a cytometer that measures cancer biomarkers may use a specific measurement value to decide between healthy or diseased cells."</em> <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/07/new-device-design-brings-unparalleled-confidence-cell-measurements">[...]</a>

If you’ve ever made an origami paper crane, using folds and creases to transform a square piece of craft paper into the delicate long-necked bird, it may seem odd that those same folding techniques are being used to develop structures used in one of the most advanced areas of modern technology: space missions. Yet aerospace engineers have turned to the millenary art of origami to solve a serious conundrum: How do you fit massive structures, like shields that can block starlight and sails that can help propel spacecraft, into the significantly smaller rockets that carry these structures into space? While the sizes of each of these structures vary, picture yourself trying to fit a beach umbrella with a 28-meter diameter (about the length of a basketball court) into a minivan. Figuring out the answer to this question is central to enabling future space missions that will one day search for Earth-like exoplanets and spacecraft that will better measure the Earth system using radar remote-sensing.
