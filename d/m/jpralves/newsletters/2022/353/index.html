<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1853, o inventor norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_Maxim">Hudson Maxim</a>.  No início da sua carreira, num negócio de impressão em Pittsfield, Mass. (1883), inventou um método de impressão a cores em jornais. Depois voltou-se para a melhoria dos explosivos e fez a primeira pólvora sem fumo nos Estados Unidos. Em 1901, inventou o maximite, um pó altamente explosivo 50% mais potente do que a dinamite. Quando usado em torpedos, maximite resistiu tanto ao choque de disparo como ao maior choque de perfuração da placa de blindagem sem explodir até ser então desencadeado por um fusível detonante de acção retardada, outra invenção de Maxim. Mais tarde, aperfeiçoou um nova pólvora sem fumo, chamado estabilite devido à sua alta estabilidade, e motorite, uma substância auto-combustiva para propulsar torpedos.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1859, o designer alemão de aviões <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Junkers">Hugo Junkers</a>. Ele foi o proponente inicial da construção monoplano e totalmente metálica de aviões. A sua empresa, Junkers Flugzeug- und Motorenwerke AG (Junkers Aircraft and Motor Works), foi um dos pilares da indústria aeronáutica alemã nos anos entre a Primeira Guerra Mundial e a Segunda Guerra Mundial. Os seus aviões multimotores, totalmente metálicos, de passageiros e de carga ajudaram a estabelecer companhias aéreas na Alemanha e em todo o mundo.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1890, o físico suíço <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Scherrer">Paul Scherrer</a>. Ele, em colaboração com Peter Debye produziu um método de análise de difracção de raios X. O método Debye-Scherrer tem a capacidade de identificar materiais que não estejam na forma de cristais grandes e perfeitos.</p>

<p>Em 1966, os EUA lançaram o seu primeiro satélite meteorológico operacional, o ESSA-1, para fornecer fotografia de cobertura de nuvens ao Centro Meteorológico Nacional dos EUA para a preparação de análises e previsões meteorológicas operacionais. A nave espacial era um polígono de 18 lados, 42 polegadas de diâmetro, 22 polegadas de altura e peso 305 lb. Era feita de liga de alumínio e aço inoxidável, depois coberta com 9100 células solares. As células solares serviram para carregar as 63 baterias. As suas duas câmaras foram montadas 180 graus uma contra a outra ao longo do lado cilíndrico da embarcação. Uma câmara podia ser apontada em algum ponto da Terra sempre que o satélite girasse ao longo do seu eixo. A ESSA-1 conseguia ver o tempo de cada área do globo, fotografando uma determinada área exactamente à mesma hora local todos os dias.</p>

<p>Também em 1966, e três dias após a sua descolagem, a nave espacial soviética Lunik 9 não tripulada aterrou em segurança na Lua, no Oceano das Tempestades. Foi a primeira aterragem suave de sempre noutro corpo celeste, e abriu o caminho para viagens tripuladas à Lua, eliminando dúvidas de que a superfície fosse uma areia movediça empoeirada e insegura. Ao atingir a superfície, a sonda soviética ejectou uma cápsula de 250 lb que depois rolou na vertical e desdobrou quatro pétalas accionadas por mola para se estabilizar. Uma câmara de televisão com um sistema de espelho rotativo permitiu à Lunik 9 tirar fotografias, incluindo vistas panorâmicas da paisagem lunar e vistas mais próximas das rochas próximas, que foram transmitidas de volta à terra até 6 de Fevereiro, quando as baterias se esgotaram e o contacto com a nave espacial se perdeu.</p>

<p>E nesta semana que passou foi lançado oficialmente a versão de 64-bits do Raspberry OS. A arquitectura ARMv8-A, que engloba a arquitectura AArch64 de 64 bits e o conjunto de instruções A64 associado, foi introduzida pela primeira vez na linha Raspberry Pi com Raspberry Pi 3 em 2016. A partir daí, foi possível executar um sistema operativo completo de 64-bit, e muitos sistemas operativos de terceiros estão disponíveis. Contudo, continuaram a construir os lançamentos Raspberry Pi OS na plataforma 32-bit Raspbian, com o objectivo de maximizar a compatibilidade entre dispositivos e de evitar a confusão dos clientes. Com este lançamento é possível tirar partido da arquitectura de 64-bits, que é mais util nos modelos com 4 ou 8GB de memória RAM.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker e alguns vídeos interessantes.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-os-64-bit/">Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)</a></h2>

<p><em>"Over the past year, we’ve been trialling a beta of Raspberry Pi OS in glorious 64-bit. Now it’s time to open it up to a wider audience. The ARMv8-A architecture, which encompasses the 64-bit AArch64 architecture and associated A64 instruction set, was first introduced into the Raspberry Pi line with Raspberry Pi 3 in 2016. From that point on, it has been possible to run a full 64-bit operating system on our flagship products, and many third-party operating systems are available. However, we have continued to build our Raspberry Pi OS releases on the 32-bit Raspbian platform, aiming to maximise compatibility between devices and to avoid customer confusion. As you can see from the table above, it is easy to be confused about which products will support which Debian/Raspbian ports."</em> <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-os-64-bit/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"An almost 500-mile long bolt of lightning that lit up the sky across three US states has set a new world record for longest flash, scientists have confirmed. The bolt in 2020, extended a total of 477.2 miles (768 km) and spread across Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas. The previous record was 440.6 miles (709 km) and recorded in Brazil in 2018. Lightning rarely extends over 10 miles and usually lasts under a second. Another lightning flash recorded in 2020 - in Uruguay and Argentina - has also set a new record for duration at 17.1 seconds. The previous record was 16.7 seconds."</em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60221521">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4417.html">Dual Gate Drivers from STMicroelectronics Optimize and Simplify SiC and IGBT Switching Circuits</a></h2>

<p><em>"Two new dual-channel galvanically-isolated gate drivers for IGBTs and silicon-carbide (SiC) MOSFETs from STMicroelectronics save space and ease circuit design in high-voltage power-conversion and industrial applications. The STGAP2HD for IGBTs and STGAP2SICD for SiC MOSFETs leverage ST’s latest galvanic-isolation technology to provide 6kV transient-voltage capability in a SO-36W wide-body package. In addition, ±100V/ns dv/dt transient immunity prevents spurious turn-on in electrically noisy operating conditions. The devices can deliver a powerful gate-control signal of up to 4A, with dual output pins for extra flexibility in gate driving, allowing independent adjustment of turn-on and turn-off times. The active Miller clamp prevents gate spikes during fast commutation in half-bridge topologies. Circuit protection features include thermal protection, a watchdog for safe operation, and Under-Voltage Lockout (UVLO) per channel to prevent starting-up in a dangerous low-efficiency mode."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4417.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://news.panasonic.com/global/press/data/2022/01/en220131-2/en220131-2.html">Panasonic Commercializes a Small Power Inductor of 4 mm by 4 mm Square for Automotive Use</a></h2>

<p><em>"Panasonic Corporation announced today that its Industry Company has commercialized a small power inductor[1] (4 mm by 4 mm square) for automotive use that enables higher performance and downsizing of electronic control units (ECU) for advanced drive assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving systems, with the ability to withstand harsh environment. Mass production of the power inductor will start in May 2022. As the computerization of cars advances, ECUs are now incorporated in many cars. ADAS and autonomous driving require a number of ECUs capable of highly efficient control over cars, with such ECUs requiring small and high-performance power inductors free from connection failures. The company has commercialized a small power inductor of 4 mm by 4 mm square for automotive use to address these needs. It is manufactured with a molding technology where the power inductor is completely filled with a melted metal composite material[2], and is highly resistant to vibrations, thereby preventing crack formation."</em> <a href="https://news.panasonic.com/global/press/data/2022/01/en220131-2/en220131-2.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Following Webb’s arrival at its orbital destination around Lagrange Point 2 (L2) on Jan. 24, the mission operations team began working its way through a critical series of steps: powering on all the science instruments, turning off heaters to begin a long cooldown process, and ultimately capturing the first photons on Webb’s primary camera to enable a months-long alignment of the telescope. While the MIRI instrument and some instrument components were powered on in the weeks after Webb’s Dec. 25 launch, the team didn’t finish turning on the remaining three instruments – NIRCam, NIRSpec, and FGS/NIRISS – until the past few days. The mission operations team’s next major step is to turn off instrument heaters. The heaters were necessary to keep critical optics warm to prevent the risk of water and ice condensation. As the instruments meet pre-defined criteria for overall temperatures, the team is shutting off these heaters to allow the instruments to restart the months-long process of cooling to final temperatures. When NIRCam reaches 120 kelvins (approximately -244 degrees Fahrenheit, or -153 degrees Celsius), Webb’s optics team will be ready to begin meticulously moving the 18 primary mirror segments to form a single mirror surface."</em> <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2022/01/31/following-webbs-arrival-at-l2-telescope-commissioning-set-to-begin/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A year ago today we launched our Raspberry Pi Pico board, the first product powered by the RP2040 microcontroller, a brand-new chip developed right here at Raspberry Pi. A year later we’ve sold nearly 1.5 million Picos, and thousands of you have used RP2040 in your own electronic projects and products. A lot has happened over the last year, and everyone here at Pi Towers has their own list of favourite projects and products they’ve seen or played with. With the launch of Raspberry Pi Direct on Monday we’re sure to see a lot more really soon. So if you’re interested in getting started with RP2040 in hardware you should go read the “Hardware design with RP2040” and take a look at the associated minimal viable design. While there is a growing hardware ecosystem around the RP2040, it’s been really interesting to see a software ecosystem grow alongside it."</em> <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/multilingual-blink-for-raspberry-pi-pico/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Well folks, in spite of the dire predictions of YouTube pundits, this morning the Slackhog emerged from its development den, did *not* see its shadow, and Slackware 15.0 has been officially released - another six weeks (or years) of the development treadmill averted. This has been an interesting development cycle (in the "may you live in interesting times" sense). Anyone who has followed Linux development over the years has seen the new technology and a slow but steady drift away from the more UNIX-like structure. The challenge this time around was to adopt as much of the good stuff out there as we could without changing the character of the operating system. Keep it familiar, but make it modern. And boy did we have our work cut out for us."</em> <a href="http://www.slackware.com/announce/15.0.php">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A new biologically inspired battery membrane has enabled a battery with five times the capacity of the industry-standard lithium ion design to run for the thousand-plus cycles needed to power an electric car. A network of aramid nanofibers, recycled from Kevlar, can enable lithium-sulfur batteries to overcome their Achilles heel of cycle life—the number of times it can be charged and discharged—a University of Michigan team has shown. “There are a number of reports claiming several hundred cycles for lithium-sulfur batteries, but it is achieved at the expense of other parameters—capacity, charging rate, resilience and safety. The challenge nowadays is to make a battery that increases the cycling rate from the former 10 cycles to hundreds of cycles and satisfies multiple other requirements including cost,” said Nicholas Kotov, the Irving Langmuir Distinguished University Professor of Chemical Sciences and Engineering, who led the research. “Biomimetic engineering of these batteries integrated two scales—molecular and nanoscale. For the first time, we integrated ionic selectivity of cell membranes and toughness of cartilage."</em> <a href="https://news.umich.edu/1000-cycle-lithium-sulfur-battery-could-quintuple-electric-vehicle-ranges/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The new substance is the result of a feat thought to be impossible: polymerizing a material in two dimensions. Using a novel polymerization process, MIT chemical engineers have created a new material that is stronger than steel and as light as plastic, and can be easily manufactured in large quantities. The new material is a two-dimensional polymer that self-assembles into sheets, unlike all other polymers, which form one-dimensional, spaghetti-like chains. Until now, scientists had believed it was impossible to induce polymers to form 2D sheets. Such a material could be used as a lightweight, durable coating for car parts or cell phones, or as a building material for bridges or other structures, says Michael Strano, the Carbon P. Dubbs Professor of Chemical Engineering at MIT and the senior author of the new study. “We don’t usually think of plastics as being something that you could use to support a building, but with this material, you can enable new things,” he says."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/polymer-lightweight-material-2d-0202">[...]</a>

A new computer file format which helps process DNA samples 30 times faster than existing systems has been developed by teams at UNSW and the Garvan Institute of Medical Research. The SLOW5 format has been specifically designed to more efficiently analyse nanopore sequences, which provide a more complete view of genetic variations. The improved efficiency not only helps medical experts analyse individual DNA samples much more quickly and provide faster and better healthcare to patients, but also allows more sampling in any given period. The research behind the development has been published in Nature Biotechnology, but the software has already been made available through open source and has been downloaded more than 1000 times in just a few weeks.
