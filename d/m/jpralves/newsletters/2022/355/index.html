<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1781, o médico francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Laennec">René Laennec</a>. Ele inventou o estetoscópio e é geralmente considerado o pai da medicina do tórax. Utilizando um cilindro de madeira com um pé longo que colocou no peito dos seus pacientes, conseguiu ouvir os vários sons feitos pelos pulmões e pelo coração. Durante três anos estudou os sons torácicos dos pacientes e correlacionou-os com as doenças encontradas na autópsia. Descreveu os seus métodos e descobertas no clássico De l'auscultation médiate (1819). Laënnec fez numerosas outras contribuições para a literatura das doenças respiratórias e cardíacas.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1838, o químico russo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Konrad_Beilstein">Friedrich Konrad Beilstein</a>. Ele dedicou-se à investigação em química orgânica que incluía o estudo de derivados isoméricos de benezeno. O seu legado duradouro, no entanto, foi iniciar a descrição sistemática das compoonias orgânicas, que ele concretizou na publicação do seu Handbuch der organischen Chemie, (1880-82; Handbook of Organic Chemistry). O seu objectivo era que este fosse um catálogo completo, e já na sua primeira edição, os dois volumes descreviam 15.000 compostos. Como a química orgânica continuava a crescer rapidamente, publicou a segunda e terceira edições expandidas. Após a morte de Beilstein, devido ao seu grande valor para os químicos orgânicos, o trabalho de actualização da publicação foi assumido pela Deutsche Chemische Gesellschanft, que continuou a publicá-la".</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1856, o fotógrafo e inventor norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederic_Eugene_Ives">Frederic Eugene Ives</a>. Ele foi o inventor do processo de meio-tom, um método de reprodução de fotografias numa prensa de impressão. Antes deste processo, as fotografias e ilustrações eram reproduzidas a partir de placas gravadas à mão. Desta forma, as impressoras podiam reproduzir desenhos de linha, mas não os tons de cinza numa fotografia, porque as prensas de impressão não podem imprimir a cinza - apenas a preto e branco. Ives inventou um ecrã que converteria uma fotografia num padrão de pequenos pontos. Grandes pontos formam onde a imagem é escura, e pequenos pontos onde a imagem é clara, dando assim a ilusão de tonalidades de cinzento. Em 1881, foi o primeiro a fazer uma impressão a três cores de blocos de meio-tom. Outras invenções em fotografia e impressão a cores renderam 70 patentes.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1888, o cientista germano-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Stern">Otto Stern</a>. Ele foi vencedor do Prémio Nobel da Física em 1943 pelo seu desenvolvimento do feixe molecular como ferramenta para estudar as características das moléculas e pela sua medição do momento magnético do protão.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1890, o estatístico, geneticista e biólogo evolucionista britânico <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher">Ronald Fisher</a>. Ele deu contribuições para a teoria estatística que se tornaram pilares da prática estatística moderna. Em genética, ele estabeleceu a genética biométrica e estudou o domínio através de experiências de reprodução com vários animais). Desenvolveu métodos de análise multi-variada para rastrear a ligação dos genes a diferentes características. Para evitar a introdução de preconceitos na concepção de experiências que pudessem produzir dados imprecisos ou enganosos, aplicou o seu princípio de aleatoriedade. Enquanto continuava o seu interesse em estatísticas durante os seus cursos universitários, começou a sua carreira como professor de matemática do ensino secundário (1914-19). Durante este tempo, publicou um trabalho (1918) aplicando estatísticas para produzir um teorema fundamental de selecção natural. Prosseguiu o seu estudo de genética na Estação Experimental de Rothamsted como estatístico em 1919.</p>

<p>E nesta semana que passou o Telescópio Espacial James Webb está quase a concluir a primeira fase do processo de alinhamento do espelho primário do observatório com o instrumento Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam), com a duração de meses. O desafio da equipa foi duplo: confirmar que a NIRCam estava pronto para recolher luz de objectos celestes, e depois identificar a luz estelar da mesma estrela em cada um dos 18 segmentos primários do espelho. O resultado é um mosaico de imagem de 18 pontos de luz estelar organizados aleatoriamente, o produto dos segmentos de espelho não alinhados da Webb, todos reflectindo a luz da mesma estrela no espelho secundário da Webb e nos detectores da NIRCam.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker e alguns vídeos interessantes. É apresentada a revista Hackspace Magazine Nº 52 de Março.</p>

<p><em>"The James Webb Space Telescope is nearing completion of the first phase of the months-long process of aligning the observatory’s primary mirror using the Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) instrument. The team’s challenge was twofold: confirm that NIRCam was ready to collect light from celestial objects, and then identify starlight from the same star in each of the 18 primary mirror segments. The result is an image mosaic of 18 randomly organized dots of starlight, the product of Webb’s unaligned mirror segments all reflecting light from the same star back at Webb’s secondary mirror and into NIRCam’s detectors. What looks like a simple image of blurry starlight now becomes the foundation to align and focus the telescope in order for Webb to deliver unprecedented views of the universe this summer. Over the next month or so, the team will gradually adjust the mirror segments until the 18 images become a single star. “The entire Webb team is ecstatic at how well the first steps of taking images and aligning the telescope are proceeding."</em> <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2022/02/11/photons-received-webb-sees-its-first-star-18-times/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2022/02/16/can-salton-sea-geothermal-field-prevent-coming-lithium-shortage">Can the Salton Sea geothermal field prevent the coming lithium shortage?</a></h2>

<p><em>"University of California, Riverside scientists will join a first-of-its-kind effort to map out California’s so-called “Lithium Valley,” and learn whether it can meet America’s urgent demand for lithium in a sustainable, environmentally friendly way. Lithium is required for making electric vehicle batteries and other devices that store and use electricity. As the world transitions away from fossil fuels and electric vehicles become increasingly popular, an acute deficit looms in lithium supply: its price increased by over 400% in 2021. The shortage could put the brakes on many automakers’ plans to create all-electric inventory by 2035. To help ensure America’s supply, the U.S. Department of Energy’s Geothermal Technologies Office is supporting this new lithium study with $1.14 million. It is being led by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, in partnership with UCR and Geologica Geothermal Group, Inc. “We hope that our collaborative research will provide independent, objective scientific data on the origin, extent and sustainability of the extractable lithium that is present in the Salton Sea geothermal brines,” said UCR geochemist Michael McKibben, who has been studying the Salton Sea geothermal field since the 1970s."</em> <a href="https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2022/02/16/can-salton-sea-geothermal-field-prevent-coming-lithium-shortage">[...]</a>

<p><em>"ETH physicists have modified one of the major schemes for quantum error correction and put it into practice, demonstrating that they can substantially prolong the lifetime of quantum states — a crucial ingredient for future large-​scale quantum computers. In modern computing devices, literally billions of transistors work restlessly in almost perfect harmony. The keys to producing near-​perfect computation from devices made from imperfect components are the use of digitisation and error correction, with the latter encompassing procedures to detect and rectify inaccuracies as they occur. The challenge of preventing errors from accumulating is one that future quantum computers have to face as well — in fact it forms the main barrier to realizing useful computations. Alas, the tools that have been perfected for classical computers cannot be applied directly to quantum computers, which play by another set of rules, those of quantum mechanics. Ingenious solutions for quantum error correction have been proposed over the past couple of decades, and recently there has been encouraging progress towards implementing such methods in state-​of-the-art quantum computers."</em> <a href="https://www.phys.ethz.ch/news-and-events/d-phys-news/2022/02/quantum-errors-made-more-tolerable.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"An international research team that includes Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) scientists has established a new upper limit of 0.8 electron volts (eV) for the mass of the neutrino, a milestone that will bear on future discoveries in nuclear and particle physics, and cosmology. Indeed, without a measurement of the mass scale of neutrinos – extremely light subatomic particles once thought to be beyond measurement – physicists say their understanding of the universe would remain incomplete. An electron volt is defined as the energy that an electron gains when it travels through a potential of one volt. The research team, known collectively as the Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino Experiment (KATRIN), located at Germany’s Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), published their findings Feb. 14 in the journal Nature Physics. Some of the statistical analysis used to determine the neutrino mass was performed using the Cori supercomputer at Berkeley Lab’s National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC). This push into the sub-eV mass scale of neutrinos by a model-independent laboratory method, the KATRIN team says, has allowed them to constrain the mass of these so-called lightweights of the universe with unprecedented precision."</em> <a href="https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2022/02/14/berkeley-lab-researchers-computational-facilities-play-key-role-in-barrier-breaking-neutrino-mass-measurement/">[...]</a>

In their research paper published in ACS Nano, the Sussex scientists have built on their previous work to wrap emulsion droplets with graphene and other 2D materials by reducing the coatings down to atomically-thin nanosheet layers. In doing so they were able to create electrically-conducting liquid emulsions that are the lowest-loading graphene networks ever reported – just 0.001 vol%. This means that the subsequent liquid electronic technology – whether that might be strain sensors to monitor physical performance and health, electronic devices printed from emulsion droplets, and even potentially more efficient and longer-lasting electric vehicle batteries, will be both cheaper and more sustainable because they will require less graphene or other 2D nanosheets coating the droplets. Another significant development was that the scientists can now make these electronic droplet networks using any liquids – whereas previous research focused on conventional oils and water – because they have discovered how to control which liquid droplets are wrapped in graphene, meaning that they can design the emulsions specifically to the desired application. Research Fellow in Material Physics in the University of Sussex School of Mathematical and Physical Science and lead author of the paper, Dr Sean Ogilvie explains the science behind the development: “The potential of 2D materials, such as graphene, is in their electronic properties and their processability; we developed a process to harness the surface area of our nanosheet dispersions to stabilise emulsion droplets with ultra-thin coatings."</em> <a href="https://www.sussex.ac.uk/news/article/57373-the-university-of-sussex-scientists-advancing-liquid-electronics">[...]</a>

<p><em>"University of Wisconsin–Madison physicists have made one of the highest performance atomic clocks ever, they announced Feb. 16 in the journal Nature. Their instrument, known as an optical lattice atomic clock, can measure differences in time to a precision equivalent to losing just one second every 300 billion years and is the first example of a “multiplexed” optical clock, where six separate clocks can exist in the same environment. Its design allows the team to test ways to search for gravitational waves, attempt to detect dark matter, and discover new physics with clocks. “Optical lattice clocks are already the best clocks in the world, and here we get this level of performance that no one has seen before,” says Shimon Kolkowitz, a UW–Madison physics professor and senior author of the study. “We’re working to both improve their performance and to develop emerging applications that are enabled by this improved performance.” Atomic clocks are so precise because they take advantage of a fundamental property of atoms: when an electron changes energy levels, it absorbs or emits light with a frequency that is identical for all atoms of a particular element. Optical atomic clocks keep time by using a laser that is tuned to precisely match this frequency, and they require some of the world’s most sophisticated lasers to keep accurate time."</em> <a href="https://news.wisc.edu/ultraprecise-atomic-clock-poised-for-new-physics-discoveries/">[...]</a>

We present an overview of challenges involved in such a system and show how these can be addressed using context-aware, dynamic printing. Continuous sensing ensures quality prints by adjusting the inking rate to hand movement and material properties."</em> <a href="https://hci.cs.uni-saarland.de/projects/print-a-sketch/">[...]</a>
