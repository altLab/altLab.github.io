<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1868, o engenheiro civil e geodésico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fillmore_Hayford">John Fillmore Hayford</a>. Ele estabeleceu a ciência moderna da geodésia, e fez uma determinação precisa da forma e tamanho elipsoidal da terra (1909). A União Internacional de Geodésia e Geofísica adoptou os cálculos de Hayford em 1924. Esta elipsóide internacional tem um achatamento de exactamente 1 parte em 297. O raio equatorial da Terra é de 6.378.388 m. O raio ao longo do eixo polar é então 1/297 inferior a isso ou 6.356.912 m. (Surpreendentemente, os EUA não adoptaram este dado.) A teoria de isostasia de Hayford deu que a pressão exercida pela crosta terrestre é aproximadamente a mesma em todo o globo, independentemente da natureza da superfície (por exemplo, terras baixas ou montanhas). Com modificações, esta teoria é agora utilizada para explicar fenómenos dentro da crosta. Na altura da sua morte, investigava os problemas ligados à evaporação e ao nível da água dos Grandes Lagos.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1914, o bioquímico austríaco-britânico <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Perutz">Max Perutz</a>. Ele partilhou o Prémio Nobel da Química de 1962 pela sua análise da difracção de raios X da estrutura da hemoglobina, a proteína que transporta o oxigénio dos pulmões para os tecidos através das células sanguíneas. Ele identificou que a hemoglobina é construída de quatro cadeias de proteínas enroladas juntas, e que a molécula muda de forma quando o oxigénio é adicionado. Perutz estava também interessado em estudar glaciares, fazendo medições que foram as primeiras a mostrar diferentes taxas de fluxo em diferentes partes do mesmo glaciar.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1918, o físico holandês-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Pais">Abraham Pais</a>. Ele foi responsável pela investigação que se tornou nos blocos de construção da teoria das partículas elementares. Ele escreveu Subtil É o Senhor: A Ciência e Vida de Albert Einstein, que é considerada a biografia definitiva de Einstein. Na Holanda, o seu doutoramento em física foi atribuído a 9 de Julho de 1941, cinco dias antes de um prazo nazi que proibia os judeus de receberem diplomas. Mais tarde, durante a II Guerra Mundial, enquanto se escondia para fugir à Gestapo, elaborou ideias em electrodinâmica quântica que mais tarde partilhou ao trabalhar com Niels Bohr (Jan - Ago 1946). Em Setembro de 1946, foi para os EUA para trabalhar com Robert Oppenheimer em Princeton, onde Pais contribuiu para os fundamentos da teoria moderna da física das partículas.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1955, o cientista da computação canadiano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gosling">James Gosling</a>. Ele ficou conhecido por ser o fundador e arquitecto principal por detrás da linguagem de programação Java. Ele teve a ideia da Java VM enquanto escrevia um programa para portar software de um PERQ, traduzindo o Perq Q-Code para VAX assembler e emulando o hardware. É geralmente creditado por ter inventado a linguagem de programação Java em 1994. Criou o desenho original do Java e implementou o compilador original e a máquina virtual da linguagem. Gosling traça as origens da abordagem aos seus primeiros tempos de estudante, quando criou uma máquina virtual de p-code para o computador DEC VAX do laboratório, para que o seu professor pudesse executar programas escritos em UCSD Pascal. No trabalho que conduziu ao Java na Sun, ele viu que a execução neutra em termos de arquitectura para programas amplamente distribuídos poderia ser alcançada através da implementação de uma filosofia semelhante: programar sempre para a mesma máquina virtual. Outra contribuição de Gosling's foi o programa "bundle", conhecido como "shar".</p>

<h2><a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4447.html">STMicroelectronics reveals low-noise, low-voltage regulator for energy-conscious applications</a></h2>

<p><em>"STMicroelectronics’ LD56020 200mA low-dropout voltage regulator operates with a supply from 1.1V to 5.5V and has low output noise for applications that demand excellent stability and long battery runtime. Ideal for mobiles, vision sensors, and wireless modules, the competitively priced LD56020 has extremely low dropout voltage of just 190mV (max. at full load) and maximum quiescent current of 25µA at light load. An external enable pin permits control logic to put the regulator into standby mode, which reduces current below 0.1µA. With supply-voltage rejection (SVRIN) of 90dB (1kHz, 20mA) and output noise of just 8.8µVRMS (10Hz to 100kHz), the LD56020 provides a clean power rail for low-voltage digital circuitry.

Since the days of NASA’s Apollo program, astronauts have documented (and contended with) how liquids behave differently in microgravity than they do on Earth – coalescing into floating spheres instead of bottom-heavy droplets. Now, researchers have demonstrated this effect with a much more exotic material: gas cooled to nearly absolute zero (minus 459 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 273 degrees Celsius), the lowest temperature matter can reach. Using NASA’s Cold Atom Lab, the first-ever quantum physics facility aboard the International Space Station, researchers took samples of atoms cooled to within a millionth of a degree above absolute zero and shaped them into extremely thin, hollow spheres."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/ultracold-bubbles-on-space-station-open-new-avenues-of-quantum-research">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The data center market is a thriving and innovative one, but to continue to scale the industry needs to tackle issues around fragmentation, finding the right balance between standardization where it makes sense, and differentiation where it matters. Arm introduced the SystemReady program in 2020 to address these challenges, supported by a broad set of partners from across the ecosystem. SystemReady provides a formal set of compute platform definitions to cover a range of systems from the cloud to IoT and edge, helping software 'just work' seamlessly across a vibrant, diverse ecosystem of Arm-based hardware. Today, we’re sharing some significant milestones for the SystemReady program, including some exciting “firsts” in the Arm-based server and virtual machine space: The Microsoft Azure Ampere Altra Arm-based server has achieved SystemReady SR certification, the first cloud solution provider (CSP) server to do so The Azure Virtual Machines series featuring Ampere Altra Arm-based processors are the first virtual systems to be certified under the new Arm SystemReady Virtual Environment (VE) certification The Arm SystemReady program has reached over 50 certifications since its launch only 18 months ago, demonstrating tremendous momentum Microsoft leads the way in driving critical standards Microsoft has been a strong supporter and collaborator on SystemReady since its inception, and these certifications not only illustrate the company’s leadership in driving standards, but also pave the way for more industry players to embrace the SystemReady approach and ultimately benefit from it. “At its core, the Arm SystemReady compliance certification program preserves the investments that we and customers make in our software stacks," said Arun Kishan, Technical Fellow and Corporate Vice President (CVP), Microsoft. “For Microsoft Azure, the SystemReady platform certification means we can easily move from one generation to another."</em> <a href="https://www.arm.com/company/news/2022/05/major-milestones-for-arm-systemready-in-driving-ecosystem-standards">[...]</a>

<p><em>"While the spacecraft continues to return science data and otherwise operate as normal, the mission team is searching for the source of a system data issue. The engineering team with NASA’s Voyager 1 spacecraft is trying to solve a mystery: The interstellar explorer is operating normally, receiving and executing commands from Earth, along with gathering and returning science data. But readouts from the probe’s attitude articulation and control system (AACS) don’t reflect what’s actually happening onboard. The AACS controls the 45-year-old spacecraft’s orientation. Among other tasks, it keeps Voyager 1’s high-gain antenna pointed precisely at Earth, enabling it to send data home. All signs suggest the AACS is still working, but the telemetry data it’s returning is invalid."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/engineers-investigating-nasas-voyager-1-telemetry-data">[...]</a>

This open source project enables community collaboration to advance adoption of the SYCL standard, a key step in freeing developers from a single-vendor proprietary ecosystem. “Migrating to C++ with SYCL gives code stronger ISO C++ alignment, multivendor support to relieve vendor lock-in and support for multiarchitecture to provide flexibility in harnessing the full power of new hardware innovations. SYCLomatic offers a valuable tool to automate much of the work, allowing developers to focus more on custom tuning than porting.” –James Reinders, Intel oneAPI evangelist While hardware innovation has led to a diverse heterogeneous architectural landscape for computing, software development has become increasingly complex, making it difficult to take full advantage of CPUs and accelerators. Today’s developers and their teams are strapped for time, money and resources to accommodate the rewriting and testing of code to boost application performance for these different architectures. Developers are looking for open alternatives that improve time-to-value, and Intel is providing an easier, shorter pathway to enabling hardware choice."</em> <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-releases-open-source-sycl-migration-tool.html">[...]</a>

These lasers are strong enough to cut steel, precise enough to perform surgery, and powerful enough to carry messages into deep space. They are so powerful, in fact, that it’s difficult to engineer resilient and long-lasting components that can control the powerful beams the lasers emit. Today, most mirrors used to direct the beam in high-power continuous wave (CW) lasers are made by layering thin coatings of materials with different optical properties. But if there is even one, tiny defect in any of the layers, the powerful laser beam will burn through, causing the whole device to fail. If you could make a mirror out of a single material, it would significantly reduce the likelihood of defects and increase the lifespan of the laser."</em> <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2022/05/diamond-mirrors-high-powered-lasers">[...]</a>

Removing CO2 from the oceans will enable them to continue to do their job of absorbing excess CO2 from the atmosphere.

We must also remove the carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that have already been emitted, to the tune of gigatons of CO2 removed each year by 2050 in order to achieve net zero emissions.

<p><em>"Optical fibers doped with perovskite nanocrystals bring new opportunities for photodetectors for high-speed, free-space and underwater data links. In free-space and underwater optical wireless communication systems, there is often a trade-off between the size of a photodetector and its bandwidth, with larger area devices capturing more light but at the expense of a slower maximum data speed. Now, researchers from KAUST have developed an elegant solution to the problem. Chun Hong Kang and Boon Ooi and their collaborators have designed and fabricated luminescent polymer optical fibers doped with nanocrystals of CsPbBr3 that act as a large-area scintillator. The idea is that the fibers absorb an optical data signal transmitted in the violet spectral region (around 400 nm) and then reemit it in the green region (around 510 nm) so that it can be detected by a fast avalanche photodetector. The result is a detector system that is omnidirectional and can be scaled to large areas and operate at a data transmission at hundreds of megabits per second, making it especially attractive for fast underwater optical communications."</em> <a href="https://discovery.kaust.edu.sa/en/article/1239/fiber-glow-brings-more-go-for-underwater-communications">[...]</a>

These DLAs served as galactic nurseries, as the gasses within slowly condensed to fuel the formation of stars and galaxies. They can still be observed today, but it isn’t easy. “DLAs are a key to understanding how galaxies form in the universe, but they are typically difficult to observe since the clouds are too diffuse and don’t emit any light themselves,” says Rongmon Bordoloi, assistant professor of physics at North Carolina State University and corresponding author of the research.

<p><em>"Researchers have developed a low-cost device that can selectively capture carbon dioxide gas while it charges. Then, when it discharges, the CO2 can be released in a controlled way and collected to be reused or disposed of responsibly. The supercapacitor device, which is similar to a rechargeable battery, is the size of a two-pence coin, and is made in part from sustainable materials including coconut shells and seawater. Designed by researchers from the University of Cambridge, the supercapacitor could help power carbon capture and storage technologies at much lower cost. Around 35 billion tonnes of CO2 are released into the atmosphere per year and solutions are urgently needed to eliminate these emissions and address the climate crisis. The most advanced carbon capture technologies currently require large amounts of energy and are expensive."</em> <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/low-cost-battery-like-device-absorbs-co2-emissions-while-it-charges">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Innovative research from a UNSW team shows Earth’s radiant infrared heat can be used to generate electricity, even after the sun has set. UNSW researchers have made a major breakthrough in renewable energy technology by producing electricity from so-called ‘night-time’ solar power. The team from the School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering generated electricity from heat radiated as infrared light, in the same way as the Earth cools by radiating into space at night. A semiconductor device called a thermoradiative diode, composed of materials found in night-vision goggles, was used to generate power from the emission of infrared light. The results of the research have now been published in ACS Photonics. Although the amount of power generated at this stage is very small – around 100,000 times less than that supplied by a solar panel – the researchers believe the result can be improved in the future."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/science-tech/night-time-solar-technology-can-now-deliver-power-dark">[...]</a>

The vast majority of superconducting materials operate at intensely cold temperatures, typically below -320 degrees Fahrenheit, making them impractical to use without a cooling system. Developing superconductors that operate at warmer temperatures could transform everything from laptop computers to regional power grids. “Knowing what makes these materials superconductors gets us closer to being able to control them.

<p><em>"Metasurface-based technology could be used to optically encrypt information Researchers have developed a new metasurface-based device that can produce multiple distinct holographic images depending on the surrounding medium and the wavelength of light used. The ability to store information that is only retrievable with the right set of keys — such as a certain light wavelength combined with wet conditions — could be further developed to design simple yet effective encryption devices. “Our new metasurfaces give an immediate and simple readout of the environment surrounding the surface of the device,” said research team leader Andrea Di Falco from the University of St. Andrews in the U.K. “In addition to encryption applications, this could be used as a humidity sensor or as part of more complex light-based biomedical systems.” In the Optica Publishing Group journal Optics Express, the researchers demonstrate a device that reveals a holographic butterfly with 705-nm light in dry conditions and a caterpillar when 750-nm light is combined with wet conditions. When 660-nm light is used in dry conditions, both images are visible. The selective response of the metasurfaces can be tailored to work with various pre-programmed conditions. “Our holographic devices contribute to the worldwide effort to develop the physics and applications of photonic metasurfaces, which are one of the most versatile photonic tools available to researchers to encode and manipulate information using light,” said Di Falco."</em> <a href="https://www.optica.org/en-us/about/newsroom/news_releases/2022/may/new_device_creates_different_images_depending_on_l/">[...]</a>

That can give rise to synchronized responses to inputs, a phenomenon that, if properly understood and controlled, may prove useful for developing light sources, building sensors that can take ultraprecise measurements, and understanding dissipation in quantum computers. But can you tell when atoms in a group are synced up? In new work in Nature Communications, Columbia physicist Ana Asenjo-Garcia and her postdoc Stuart Masson show how a phenomenon called a superradiant burst can indicate collective behavior among arrays of atoms, solving what’s been a decades-old problem for the field of quantum optics. Shining a laser on an atom adds energy, putting it into what’s known as an “excited” state."</em> <a href="https://quantum.columbia.edu/news/columbia-physicists-shine-new-light-old-quantum-optics-problem-about-collective-behavior">[...]</a>

In a new study, the physicists studied discrete aurora, a light-in-the-sky display that occurs mostly during the night in the red planet’s southern hemisphere. While scientists have known about discrete aurora on Mars–which also occur on Earth—they did not know how they formed. That’s because Mars does not have a global magnetic field like Earth, which is a main trigger for aurora, also called the northern and southern lights on our planet. Instead, the physicists report, discrete aurora on Mars are governed by the interaction between the solar wind—the constant jet of charged particles from the sun—and magnetic fields generated by the crust at southern latitudes on Mars. It’s the nature of this localized interaction between the solar wind and the crustal magnetic fields that lead to discrete aurora, the scientists find."</em> <a href="https://now.uiowa.edu/2022/05/physicists-explain-how-type-aurora-mars-formed">[...]</a>

Being this fast, protein folding events could often not be characterized by NMR spectroscopy; the standard method for studying molecular structures.

<p><em>"I present a method to continuously measure wind speed and wind direction as part of a custom weather station project. This article is part of a series discussing methods for adding sensing capabilities to a DIY telescoping pole project made from EMT conduit. Here I present a method for using simple off-the-shelf electronics to continuously measure (1) wind speed, and (2) wind direction as part of a custom weather station project. Weather stations, both commercially-available and do-it-yourself (DIY), feature one or more of the following sensing capabilities: - Wind speed (anemometer) - Wind direction (weather vane) - Air pressure (barometer) - Humidity (hygrometer) - Volume of rain (rain gauge) - Air temperature (thermometer) Commercial weather stations available for online purchase are convenient, but are also often: - Expensive - Non-customizable - Near-impossible to interface with hobbyist controllers such as Arduino or Raspberry Pi Regardless, these kinds of products are still sometimes the best option for home weather station projects - in those cases, a telescoping pole constructed from EMT conduit (readily available from hardware stores such as Home Depot or Lowes) made using a telescoping coupling can serve as a low-cost and study mount such all-in-one weather stations. For all other situations where a DIY solution is more appropriate for your project, in this article we present a method to measure and log wind speed and wind direction using low-cost, off-the-shelf electronics and hardware. More functionality can be added to this platform with the optional electronics modules listed below."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/ElationSportsTechnologies/emt-conduit-mounted-wind-sensors-with-arduino-83197d">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The project described here is a power-saving pulse-width modulator (PWM) controller for solenoids with an internal supply regulator. The board is based on the DRV110 IC which is a PWM current controller which is specifically designed for solenoid and relay applications. The project regulates the current with a well-controlled waveform to reduce power dissipation on the load. The solenoid current is ramped up fast to ensure the opening of the valve or relay. After initial ramping, the solenoid current is kept at a peak value to ensure correct operation, after which the current is reduced to a lower hold level to avoid thermal problems and reduce power dissipation.

<p><em>"Through a network of intelligent devices we want to monitor the fill level of trash bins to have a real time view of the situation. The main problem of waste management in a lot of big cities is overflowing bins. This brings to garbage left on the streets, bad smells, wild animals roaming and fed up citizens. It is the consequence of an inefficient usage of the resources by garbage pickup companies, both economical and logistical (employees time and garbage trucks). As an example it happens that the usual pickup route empties not yet full bins missing the full ones. IoT could help solve this problem without having to hire new workers nor buying new trucks, which would generate more long term expenses for the company."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/463097/checkbin-439d2e">[...]</a>
