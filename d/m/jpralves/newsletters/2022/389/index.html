<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1776, o matemático e engenheiro inglê <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Barlow_(mathematician)">Peter Barlow</a>. Ele inventou duas variedades de lentes telescópicas acromáticas (não-distorcedoras de cor). Em 1819, Barlow começou a trabalhar no problema do desvio das bússolas de navios causado pela presença de ferro no casco. Pelo seu método de correcção do desvio por justaposição da bússola com um pedaço de ferro com a forma adequada, foi-lhe atribuída a Medalha Copley. Em 1822, construiu um dispositivo que deve ser considerado um dos primeiros modelos de um motor eléctrico fornecido por corrente contínua. Trabalhou também no desenho de pontes, em particular trabalhando (1819-26) com Thomas Telford no desenho da ponte sobre o Estreito de Menai, a primeira grande ponte suspensa moderna. Barlow esteve activo durante o período da construção ferroviária na Grã-Bretanha.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1932, o matemático norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_G._Thompson">John G. Thompson</a>. Ele recebeu a Medalha Fields em 1970 pelo seu trabalho em teoria de grupo, resolvendo (com Walter Feit) um dos seus problemas mais espinhosos, o chamado problema da "ordem estranha". (A teoria de grupo é um ramo da matemática que se concentra no estudo das simetrias - tais como as simetrias de uma figura geométrica, ou simetrias que surgem em soluções para equações algébricas). A prova de Thompson, com 253 páginas de equações, preencheu um número inteiro do Pacific Journal of Mathematics. Destaca-se como uma das mais longas e complexas da matemática. Thompson também colaborou na classificação dos grupos finitos simples, os blocos de construção de grupos mais gerais. A teoria dos grupos tem aplicações importantes em física, química e outros campos.</p>

<p>Em 1884, Greenwich foi adoptado como o meridiano universal. A pedido do Presidente dos EUA, 41 delegados de 25 nações reuniram-se em Washington, DC, para a Conferência Internacional do Meridiano. Na Conferência foram estabelecidos vários princípios importantes: um único meridiano mundial passando pelo principal Instrumento de Trânsito no Observatório de Greenwich; que toda a longitude seria calculada tanto a leste como a oeste a partir deste meridiano até 180°; um dia universal; e estudos do sistema decimal para a divisão do tempo e do espaço. A Resolução 2, que fixa o Meridiano em Greenwich foi aprovada 22-1 (San Domingo votou contra, França e Brasil abstiveram-se). Greenwich situa-se no rio Tamisa, a poucos quilómetros do centro de Londres.</p>

<p><em>"A new image shows at least 17 dust rings created by a rare type of star and its companion locked in a celestial dance. A new image from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope reveals a remarkable cosmic sight: at least 17 concentric dust rings emanating from a pair of stars. Located just over 5,000 light-years from Earth, the duo is collectively known as Wolf-Rayet 140. Each ring was created when the two stars came close together and their stellar winds (streams of gas they blow into space) met, compressing the gas and forming dust. The stars’ orbits bring them together about once every eight years; like the growth of rings of a tree’s trunk, the dust loops mark the passage of time. “We’re looking at over a century of dust production from this system,” said Ryan Lau, an astronomer at NSF’s NOIRLab and lead author of a new study about the system, published today in the journal Nature Astronomy."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/star-duo-forms-fingerprint-in-space-nasas-webb-finds">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Marking a significant milestone in delivering an end-to-end programmable platform that leverages the combined benefits of Intel’s hardware and software offerings, Google Cloud has announced the successful deployment of its new C3 machine series. The C3 machine series features 4th Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors in private preview and debuts the Intel® infrastructure processing unit E2000, co-designed by Google and Intel. Through its unique architectural approach, C3 machine instances deliver strong performance gains of up to 20% over previous generation C2 instances, enabling high performance computing and data-intensive workloads. Google Cloud C3 machines also pave the way for a future where infrastructure processing units (IPUs) are integrated into data centers, accelerating cloud infrastructures and maximizing performance. “We are pleased to have codesigned the first ASIC infrastructure processing unit with Google Cloud, which has now launched in the new C3 machine series. A first of its kind in any public cloud, C3 VMs will run workloads on 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors while they free up programmable packetprocessing to the IPUs securely at line rates of 200 gigabits per second,” says Nick McKeown, Intel senior vice president, Intel Fellow and general manager of Network and Edge Group."</em> <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/boosting-performance-programmable-processing.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The gently rolling hills here in eastern Washington have long grown rich harvests of wheat, barley and lentils. Fifth-generation farmer Andrew Nelson is adding a new bumper crop to that bounty: Data. He gathers it from sensors in the soil, drones in the sky and satellites in space. They feed Nelson information about his farm at distinct points, every day, all year long — temperature variations, soil moisture and nutrient levels, plant health and more. Nelson in turn feeds that data into Project FarmVibes, a new suite of farm-focused technologies from Microsoft Research. Starting today, Microsoft will open source these tools so researchers and data scientists — and the rare farmer like Nelson, who is also a software engineer — can build upon them to turn agricultural data into action that can help boost yields and cut costs."</em> <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/ai/microsoft-open-sources-its-farm-of-the-future-toolkit/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Quantum calculations performed by researchers from the University of Surrey have allowed scientists to discover new ‘phases’ of two-dimensional (2D) material that could be used to develop the next generation of fuel-cells devices. The calculations aided Graz University of Technology's research into the growth of one of the most promising 2D materials, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) - which has a honeycomb crystal structure almost identical to that of the most famous 2D material, graphene. Dr Anton Tamtögl, the project lead from Graz University of Technology, said: "The nanoporous phases discovered during our research are not of purely academic interest - they offer the potential for applications such as sensor materials, nanoreactors, and membranes. This work illustrates that fundamental physics and chemistry offer routes to truly relevant nanotechnology applications." Ultra-thin 2D materials are frequently grown by exposing a hot metal surface to a specific gas, which results in the gas decomposing on the metal and forming the desired 2D material. Due to the hot temperatures involved, it is difficult to monitor the growth of 2D materials during the several intermediate steps involved before the 2D material is completed."</em> <a href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk/news/new-process-build-2d-materials-made-possible-quantum-calculations">[...]</a>

<p><em>"PhD student Alex Greene studies superconducting quantum computing systems while rounding out their busy schedule with water sanitation projects. In Building 13 on MIT’s campus, there sits a half-a-million-dollar piece of equipment that looks like a long stretched-out chandelier, with a series of gold discs connected by thin silver pipes. The equipment, known as a dilution refrigerator, is a key player in PhD student Alex Greene’s research, as it houses all their experiments. “My life gets shaped around its rhythms,” they say. The first time Greene helped put new samples in the fridge, they were working with a postdoc at midnight on a Friday, blasting Danish screamo music. Ever since, the fridge has led them on both exciting and frustrating adventures throughout their PhD research on reducing errors in quantum computing systems."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/alex-greene-quantum-computers-1013">[...]</a>

<p><em>"With a high energy density, Li-O2 batteries have become a state-of-the-art battery technology. Inside the Li-O2 battery, the generation and disintegration of the discharged product solid lithium peroxide (Li2O2) have a significant effect on the battery’s performance. Previous researches shed little light on Li2O2 ‘s form and distribution inside, leaving questions regarding the trend and contributing factor of internal Li2O2 ‘s change in form and size unanswered. Recently, a team led by Prof. TAN Peng from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences designed a carbon-coated anodic aluminum oxide (C-AAO) air electrode with a highly-ordered, array-like structure. The team gained new insights into the sudden death and reaction routes of Li-O2 batteries. The work was published in Nano Letters."</em> <a href="https://en.ustc.edu.cn/info/1007/4448.htm">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Simple microparticles can beat rhythmically together, generating an oscillating electrical current that could be used to power microrobotic devices. Taking advantage of a phenomenon known as emergent behavior in the microscale, MIT engineers have designed simple microparticles that can collectively generate complex behavior, much the same way that a colony of ants can dig tunnels or collect food. Working together, the microparticles can generate a beating clock that oscillates at a very low frequency. These oscillations can then be harnessed to power tiny robotic devices, the researchers showed. “In addition to being interesting from a physics point of view, this behavior can also be translated into an on-board oscillatory electrical signal, which can be very powerful in microrobotic autonomy. There are a lot of electrical components that require such an oscillatory input,” says Jingfan Yang, a recent MIT PhD recipient and one of the lead authors of the new study."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/microparticles-oscillating-current-1013">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Strong electron interactions allow topological state to be switched on and off For the first time, U.S. and European physicists have found a way to switch the topological state of a quantum material on and off. Because they are extremely stable and have immutable features that cannot be erased or lost to quantum decoherence, topological states play an important role in materials research and quantum computing. In a study published in Nature Communications, researchers from Rice University, Austria’s Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien), Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Netherlands’ Radboud University described their method of using a magnetic field to activate and deactivate a topological state in a strongly correlated metal. “Topological properties are usually found in insulating materials with weak electron correlations,” said Rice study co-author Qimiao Si, a member of the Rice Quantum Initiative and director of the Rice Center for Quantum Materials (RCQM). “The material we study is metallic and is strongly correlated.” Strongly correlated quantum materials are those where the interactions of billions upon billions of electrons give rise to collective behaviors like unconventional superconductivity or electrons that behave as if they have more than 1,000 times their normal mass. Though physicists have studied topological materials for decades, they have only recently begun investigating topological metals that host strongly correlated interactions."</em> <a href="https://news.rice.edu/news/2022/physicists-use-electron-correlations-control-topological-materials">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Imagine being able to morph your legs into flippers before you jump in the water. Yale researchers have created a robot that accomplishes this feat through a process they dubbed “adaptive morphogenesis.” The project is described in the Oct. 12 edition of Nature and is featured on the issue’s cover. The robot, ART (Amphibious Robotic Turtle), takes inspiration from water and land turtles, a group whose fossil record spans over 110 million years. “Terrestrial and aquatic turtles share similar bodies, with four limbs and a shell, but have distinctive limb shapes and gaits adapted for their specific environment,” said Rebecca Kramer-Bottiglio, the John J. Lee Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering &amp; Materials Science and principal investigator of the study. “Sea turtles have elongated flippers for swimming, whereas land turtles and tortoises have rounded legs for load bearing while walking.” The robot features morphing limbs that can adapt their shape, stiffness, and behavior to the environment. The limbs use variable stiffness materials and artificial muscles to transform their shape when transitioning from one environment to another."</em> <a href="https://news.yale.edu/2022/10/12/morphing-limbs-robot-travels-land-and-water">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.optica.org/en-us/about/newsroom/news_releases/2022/october/researchers_develop_automatic_drawing_machine_for/">Researchers develop automatic drawing machine for making paper-based metamaterials</a></h2>

<p><em>"New approach creates metamaterials that are light, thin and flexible Researchers have developed an automatic drawing machine that uses pens and pencils to draw metamaterials onto paper. They demonstrated the new approach by using it to make three metamaterials that can be used to manipulate the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Metamaterials are artificially engineered composite materials that derive their properties from patterned microstructures, rather than the chemical composition of the materials themselves. The exact shape, geometry, size, orientation and arrangement of the structures can be used to manipulate electromagnetic waves in ways that aren’t possible with conventional materials. “Metamaterials, especially those used as absorbers, generally need to be thin, lightweight, wide and strong, but it isn’t easy to create thin and lightweight devices using traditional substrates,” said research team leader Junming Zhao from Nanjing University in China. “Using paper as the substrate can help meet these requirements while also lending itself to metasurfaces that conform to a surface or that are mechanically reconfigurable.” In the journal Optical Materials Express, the researchers describe their new technique, which uses a ballpoint pen with conductive ink to draw conductors and mechanical pencils to draw resistors and resistive films."</em> <a href="https://www.optica.org/en-us/about/newsroom/news_releases/2022/october/researchers_develop_automatic_drawing_machine_for/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The technique could be used to fabricate computer chips that won’t get too hot while operating, or materials that can convert waste heat to energy. Computer chips are packed with billions of microscopic transistors that enable powerful computation, but also generate a great deal of heat. A buildup of heat can slow a computer processor and make it less efficient and reliable. Engineers employ heat sinks to keep chips cool, sometimes along with fans or liquid cooling systems; however, these methods often require a lot of energy to operate. Researchers at MIT have taken a different approach. They developed an algorithm and software system that can automatically design a nanoscale material that can conduct heat in a specific manner, such as channeling heat in only one direction."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/nanomaterials-conduct-heat-chips-1007">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Despite being considered well established, the physics of optical waves have some fundamental aspects, which are still under debate. One of these effects, the anomalous behaviour of focused light fields, has now been investigated in a new light, a quantum light. Researchers from Tampere University, Finland, have shown that quantum light with a well-defined photon number behaves differently to standard focused laser beams. This finding both deepens understanding of the phenomena and enables super-sensitive distance measurements. Optics, the study of light, is one of the oldest fields in physics and has never ceased to surprise researchers. Although the classical description of light as a wave phenomenon is rarely questioned, the physical origins of some optical effects are."</em> <a href="https://www.tuni.fi/en/news/optical-foundations-illuminated-quantum-light">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Using existing experimental and computational resources, a multi-institutional team has developed an effective method for measuring high-dimensional qudits encoded in quantum frequency combs, which are a type of photon source, on a single optical chip. Although the word “qudit” might look like a typo, this lesser-known cousin of the qubit, or quantum bit, can carry more information and is more resistant to noise — both of which are key qualities needed to improve the performance of quantum networks, quantum key distribution systems and, eventually, the quantum internet. Classical computer bits categorize data as ones or zeroes, whereas qubits can hold values of one, zero or both — simultaneously — owing to superposition, which is a phenomenon that allows multiple quantum states to exist at the same time. The “d” in qudit stands for the number of different levels or values that can be encoded on a photon. Traditional qubits have two levels, but adding more levels transforms them into qudits. Recently, researchers from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Purdue University and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne, or EPFL, fully characterized an entangled pair of eight-level qudits, which formed a 64-dimensional quantum space — quadrupling the previous record for discrete frequency modes."</em> <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/news/new-measurements-quantifying-qudits-provide-glimpse-quantum-future">[...]</a>

Now, these researchers will turn heads out in the “wild” with their first untethered exoskeleton, featured in a paper published Oct. 12 in Nature. “This exoskeleton personalizes assistance as people walk normally through the real world,” said Steve Collins, associate professor of mechanical engineering who leads the Stanford Biomechatronics Laboratory. “And it resulted in exceptional improvements in walking speed and energy economy.” This “robotic boot” has a motor that works with calf muscles to give the wearer an extra push with every step. But, unlike other exoskeletons out there, this push is personalized thanks to a machine-learning-based model that was trained through years of work using emulators."</em> <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2022/10/12/exoskeleton-makes-walking-faster-less-tiring/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"New technique could enable processing speeds a million to a billion times faster than today's computers and spur progress in many-body physics The key to maximizing traditional or quantum computing speeds lies in our ability to understand how electrons behave in solids, and a collaboration between the University of Michigan and the University of Regensburg captured electron movement in attoseconds—the fastest speed yet. Seeing electrons move in increments of one quintillionth of a second could help push processing speeds up to a billion times faster than what is currently possible. In addition, the research offers a “game-changing” tool for the study of many-body physics. “Your current computer’s processor operates in gigahertz, that’s one billionth of a second per operation,” said Mackillo Kira, U-M professor of electrical engineering and computer science, who led the theoretical aspects of the study published in Nature. “In quantum computing, that’s extremely slow because electrons within a computer chip collide trillions of times a second and each collision terminates the quantum computing cycle. “What we’ve needed, in order to push performance forward, are snapshots of that electron movement that are a billion times faster."</em> <a href="https://news.umich.edu/seeing-electron-movement-at-fastest-speed-ever-could-help-unlock-next-level-quantum-computing/">[...]</a>

In a study published today in Frontiers in Robotics &amp; AI, Hannah Stuart, assistant professor of mechanical engineering, and her team demonstrated one of the first legged robots that can self-burrow vertically. This digging robot, called EMBUR (EMerita BUrrowing Robot), uses a novel leg design to achieve downward motion that emulates the way Pacific mole crabs bury themselves in beach sand. Mole crabs make burrowing look easy, but, according to Laura Treers, the study’s lead author and a Ph.D. student in mechanical engineering in Stuart’s Embodied Dexterity research group, it is difficult to move downward through granular media, like sand and soil.

<p><em>"Part of the process of making the Analumi-Clock was experimenting with different display mediums. In this version the display medium was a 3D printed photo luminescent transluscent disc. The intention was this would to be lit from the back using the same UV LED's In order to retain compatibility with the previous version the display disc would be the same size as a CD and be a push fit on to the motor spindle. This meant that the disc and the axle could be printed as one complete unit. Only one photo luminescent filament was evaluated and this was compared to the photo luminescent paper, regarding initial intensity, clarity and light decay. This version used the same hardware and software from the previous Analumi-Clock with very minor changes."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/AnalumiClock-V3/">[...]</a>

Coming from the experience of the first version here it is the second one. The circuit is much more robust and solid (the Uno wafer style was a nightmare...), I added an ADC controller for current absorption calculation, there are two separated voltage regulators for 5V: one for the circuit and a bigger one for the stepper motor. I introduced PID algorithm (Progressive, Integrative, Derivative) so we can modify the behaviour, the responsiveness, of the autopilot, smooth or aggressive."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/marcozonca/autopilot-for-sailing-boats-new-version-2-251a60">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The ROTAforMI is a versatile robotic device for controlling the position and orientation of a microscope slide using four degrees of freedom. This prototype is a complementary development of the idea behind the Roto-microscope project. It was inspired by related projects of servo motors-controlled micromanipulators and 3D micro scanners. The device is entirely 3D printed and is actioned by four small servos controlled by one Arduino Nano microcontroller. The device can be controlled manually using two micro joysticks (and possibly also automatically via a programmed sequence of movements). In addition, a Bluetooth remote can take snapshots with a smartphone's camera."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/The-ROTAforMI-a-RObotic-TAble-for-Microscopy/">[...]</a>

It’s all wrapped up in a 3D-printed skull-like housing. When the skeleton detects someone or something close in front, the Pi triggers a small servo hooked up to a 3D-printed gear. This interfaces with a pair of racks which drive the skull’s eyebrows up and down, and opens and shuts its jaw. Of course, there are some major anatomical problems here. Skulls don’t have eyebrows; that’s just not possible."</em> <a href="https://www.kevsrobots.com/blog/spooky-scary-skeleton.html">[...]</a>
