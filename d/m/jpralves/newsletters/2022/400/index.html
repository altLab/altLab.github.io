<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1800, o inventor norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Goodyear">Charles Goodyear</a>. Ele cozeu borracha misturada com enxofre e descobriu o processo de vulcanização que tornou a borracha prática como um produto comercial. Anteriormente, a borracha tinha uma utilização limitada, uma vez que congelava com força no Inverno e grudava no Verão. Após anos de experimentação persistente, Goodyear tinha criado um composto duro, curado, capaz de resistir ao calor e ao stress. Infelizmente, era um pobre homem de negócios, incapaz de lucrar com a sua invenção ou de a patentear efectivamente no estrangeiro. O nome "vulcanizado" foi aplicado pelo pioneiro inglês da borracha Thomas Hancock, usando a sugestão de um amigo para dar ao processo o nome de Vulcan, o deus romano do fogo. A Goodyear também nunca foi ligada à Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. que foi nomeada em sua honra.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1813, o químico industrial britânico <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Parkes">Alexander Parkes</a>. Ele era um perito em galvanoplastia, capaz de plastificar objectos tão diversos como uma teia de aranha e flores. Patenteou um método de revestimento de tecidos de borracha para os impermeabilizar (1841), um processo de galvanoplastia (1843), e um método de extracção de prata do minério de chumbo por adição de zinco (1850). Produziu o primeiro plástico (1855), a que chamou Parkesine, dissolvendo o nitrato de celulose em álcool e cânfora contendo éter. O resultado sólido duro podia ser moldado quando aquecido, mas ele não encontrou mercado para o material. (Isto foi redescoberto na década de 1860 por John Wesley Hyatt, um químico americano, que lhe deu o nome de celulóide e o comercializou com sucesso como um substituto do marfim).</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1856, o matemático holandês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Joannes_Stieltjes">Thomas Joannes Stieltjes</a>. Ele foi um pioneiro no campo dos problemas do momento e contribuiu para o estudo das fracções contínuas. O Instituto Thomas Stieltjes de Matemática da Universidade de Leiden, dissolvido em 2011, recebeu o seu nome, assim como a integral Riemann-Stieltjes.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1905, o engenheiro electrotécnico franco-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_G._Busignies">Henri-Gaston Busignies</a>. Ele é responsável pela invenção de localizadores de direcção de alta frequência (HF/DF, ou "Huff Duff") que permitiram à Marinha dos EUA durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial detectar transmissões inimigas e localizar rapidamente a direcção de onde vinha uma transmissão rádio. Busignies inventaram a bússola radio-eléctrica (1926) quando ainda era estudante no Colégio Jules Ferry, em Versalhes, França. Em 1934, começou a desenvolver o localizador de direcção com base na sua anterior bússola radio. Busignies desenvolveu o indicador de alvo móvel para radar em tempo de guerra. Ele apagou do ecrã do radar todos os ecos de objectos estacionários e deixou apenas ecos de objectos em movimento, tais como aviões.</p>

<p>Em 1987, o cosmonauta Yuri Romanenko regressa à Terra, terminando o seu recorde de 326 dias de voo espacial em órbita da Terra na estação espacial de Mir. A nave espacial Soyuz aterrou num local coberto de neve no Cazaquistão. A sua estadia no espaço bateu o anterior recorde soviético de 237 dias. Romanenko entrou em órbita em 6 de Fevereiro de 1987 com o engenheiro de voo Alexander Laveikin que sofreu problemas cardíacos cinco meses mais tarde e foi substituído por Alexander Alexandrov. Eles conduziram 1.000 experiências em biologia, medicina, processamento de materiais e geologia. Romanenko e Alexandrov utilizaram o laboratório gigante de astrofísica Kvant (Quantum) ligado à Mir para recolher dados de partes remotas do sistema solar. Num total de 3 missões espaciais, acumulou 430,76 dias no espaço.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker assim como alguns videos interessantes. São apresentados os livros "The Linux Command Line" e "Adventures with the Linux Command Line". Esta é a newsletter Nº400. Durante 400 semanas preparei esta newsletter com os artigos que fui recolhendo que seriam úteis. Este projeto, se é que assim se pode chamar, foi lançado a 5 de Maio de 2015 e ao longo destes quase sete anos foram indexados aqui na newsletter mais de vinte e dois mil artigos das mais diversas origens e assuntos. Sendo esta a ultima newsletter do ano, resta-me desejar um excelente ano de 2023 a todos e esperar que este novo ano seja melhor que o atual.</p>

<p><em>"The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite launched into Earth orbit on Friday, Dec. 16, from Vandenberg Space Force Base in central California, and engineers are working to prepare the mission to begin measuring the height of water on over 90% of Earth’s surface, providing a high-definition survey of our planet’s water for the first time. But before it can do that, the satellite would need to unfold its large mast and antenna panels (see above) after successfully deploying the solar panel arrays that power the spacecraft. The mission monitors and controls the satellite using telemetry data, but it also equipped spacecraft with four customized commercial cameras to record the action. The solar arrays fully deployed shortly after launch, taking about 10 minutes. The antennas successfully deployed over four days, a process that was completed on Dec. 22. The two cameras focused on the KaRIn antennas captured the mast extending out from the spacecraft and locking in place but stopped short of capturing the antennas being fully deployed (a milestone the team confirmed with telemetry data.)"</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/watch-the-latest-water-satellite-unfold-itself-in-space">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Earlier this year Fab 34 in Ireland took delivery of its first EUV lithography system, a key enabler of Intel 4 process technology. The system, made by Dutch manufacturer ASML, is arguably the most complicated piece of machinery humans have ever built. Since its arrival, local teams have been working through the installation phase and this week reached an important moment as the EUV scanner generated its 13.5 nanometre wavelength light for the first time in Ireland. This is a key milestone on the path towards high volume production of Intel 4 technology and is the first time a high volume EUV scanner will be used in Europe. Preparing for a critical milestone The EUV system consists of 100,000 parts, 3,000 cables, 40,000 bolts and more than a mile of hosing. It took 18 months of design and construction activity to prepare the Fab 34 building to receive the machine."</em> <a href="https://www.intel.ie/content/www/ie/en/newsroom/news/first-euv-light-marks-key-milestone-intel-4-europe.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"NEO Surveyor is the first purpose-built space telescope that will advance NASA’s planetary defense efforts by finding and tracking hazardous near-Earth objects. A space telescope designed to search for the hardest-to-find asteroids and comets that stray into Earth’s orbital neighborhood, NASA’s Near-Earth Object Surveyor (NEO Surveyor) recently passed a rigorous technical and programmatic review. Now the mission is transitioning into the final design-and-fabrication phase and establishing its technical, cost, and schedule baseline. The mission supports the objectives of NASA’s Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO) at NASA Headquarters in Washington. The NASA Authorization Act of 2005 directed NASA to discover and characterize at least 90% of the near-Earth objects more than 140 meters (460 feet) across that come within 30 million miles (48 million kilometers) of our planet’s orbit. Objects of this size are capable of causing significant regional damage, or worse, should they impact the Earth."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/construction-begins-on-nasas-next-generation-asteroid-hunter">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Rolls-Royce today announced it has completed building and is preparing to test its UltraFan®, technology demonstrator. In a major milestone for the programme, the demonstrator engine was transported from the build workshop and into Testbed 80 in Derby, UK where it was mounted in preparation for testing. The first test of the demonstrator is expected to take place early next year and will be operated using 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel. Chris Cholerton, President of Rolls-Royce Civil Aerospace, said: “Seeing the UltraFan demonstrator come together and getting ready for test in Testbed 80 is a great way to end the year. We have all been waiting for this moment, which is such an important milestone for the programme and for the team who have worked on it. The next stage will be to see UltraFan run for the first time on 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel in 2023, proving the technology is ready to support more sustainable flight in the future.” Combining a brand new engine design with a suite of technologies to support sustainable air travel for decades to come, the UltraFan demonstrator has a fan diameter of 140 inches and offers a 25% fuel efficiency improvement compared with the first generation of Trent engine."</em> <a href="https://www.rolls-royce.com/media/press-releases/2022/19-12-2022-rr-ultrafan-technology-demonstrator-build-complete-and-getting-ready-to-test.aspx">[...]</a>

<p><em>"SpaceX launched the first batch of a new generation of Starlink satellites into orbit early Wednesday (Dec. 28) and nailed a rocket landing at sea to mark a record 60th flight of the year. A Falcon 9 rocket topped with 54 upgraded Starlink internet satellites — the first generation 2 (Gen2) versions of the SpaceX fleet — lit up the predawn sky with a smooth launch at 4:34 a.m. EST (0934 GMT) from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. "Under our new license, we are now able to deploy satellites to new orbits that will add even more capacity to the network," Jesse Anderson, a SpaceX production and engineering manager, said during live launch commentary. "Ultimately, this enables us to add more customers and provide faster service, particularly in areas that are currently oversubscribed." About eight minutes after liftoff, the Falcon 9 first stage returned to Earth with a landing on the SpaceX drone ship A Shortfall of Gravitas in the Atlantic Ocean, where rough recovery weather threatened to delay the launch. The touchdown marked a successful end to SpaceX's 60th launch of SpaceX in 2022, nearly doubling the 31 launches set as a SpaceX record in 2021."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-starlink-satellites-5-1-group-launch">[...]</a>

Snow, ice, and frost accompany the season’s sub-zero temperatures. Some of the coldest of these occur at the planet’s poles, where it gets as low as minus 190 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 123 degrees Celsius). Cold as it is, don’t expect snow drifts worthy of the Rocky Mountains.

<h2><a href="https://www.aalto.fi/en/news/a-peculiar-protected-structure-links-viking-knots-with-quantum-vortices">A peculiar protected structure links Viking knots with quantum vortices</a></h2>

<p><em>"Mathematical analysis identifies a vortex structure that is impervious to decay Scientists have shown how three vortices can be linked in a way that prevents them from being dismantled. The structure of the links resembles a pattern used by Vikings and other ancient cultures, although this study focused on vortices in a special form of matter known as a Bose-Einstein condensate. The findings have implications for quantum computing, particle physics and other fields. Postdoctoral researcher Toni Annala uses strings and water vortices to explain the phenomenon: ‘If you make a link structure out of, say, three unbroken strings in a circle, you can’t unravel it because the string can’t go through another string. If, on the other hand, the same circular structure is made in water, the water vortices can collide and merge if they are not protected.’ ‘In a Bose-Einstein condensate, the link structure is somewhere between the two,’ says Annala, who began working on this in Professor Mikko Möttönen’s research group at Aalto University before moving back to the University of British Columbia and then to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. Roberto Zamora-Zamora, a postdoctoral researcher in Möttönen’s group, was also involved in the study."</em> <a href="https://www.aalto.fi/en/news/a-peculiar-protected-structure-links-viking-knots-with-quantum-vortices">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Wirelessly powered large-area electronics could enable a cheaper and greener internet of things. Emerging forms of thin-film device technologies that rely on alternative semiconductor materials, such as printable organics, nanocarbon allotropes and metal oxides, could contribute to a more economically and environmentally sustainable internet of things (IoT), a KAUST-led international team suggests. The IoT is set to have a major impact on daily life and many industries. It connects and facilitates data exchange between a multitude of smart objects of various shape and size — such as remote-controlled home security systems, self-driving cars equipped with sensors that detect obstacles on the road, and temperature-controlled factory equipment — over the internet and other sensing and communications networks. This burgeoning hypernetwork is projected to reach trillions of devices by next decade, boosting the number of sensor nodes deployed in its platforms. Current approaches used to power sensor nodes rely on battery technology, but batteries need regular replacement, which is costly and environmentally harmful over time."</em> <a href="https://discovery.kaust.edu.sa/en/article/1306/a-greener-internet-of-things-with-no-wires-attached">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The auto-encoder technique uses a neural network to facilitate the discovery of hidden features of materials that cannot be easily recognized by humans X-ray diffraction (XRD) is an essential technique to identify the structures and compositions of newly developed materials. However, XRD patterns consist of multiple peaks, and it is not always possible to judge which ones are relevant to describe the features of the material. Researchers from Japan have recently proposed a neural network that uses the auto-encoder technique to permit the in-depth analysis of XRD patterns to reveal features that might not be identified by humans. X-ray diffraction (XRD) is an experimental technique to discern the atomic structure of a material by irradiating it with x-rays at different angles. Essentially, the intensity of the reflected x-rays becomes high at specific irradiation angles, producing a pattern of diffraction peaks. An XRD serves as a fingerprint for a material since each substance produces a unique pattern."</em> <a href="https://www.jaist.ac.jp/english/whatsnew/press/2022/12/23-1.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Texas A&amp;M Researchers are applying metal additive manufacturing techniques to embed a hidden cache of information within products to help combat counterfeited goods. Ensuring manufactured goods and components have not been copied and replaced illegally by counterfeited goods is a high-priority concern of the manufacturing and defense industries in the U.S. and around the world. A potential solution would hold wide-reaching impacts and implications in various areas ranging from enhancing biomedical implants to protecting national defense assets. Texas A&amp;M University researchers have developed a method of imprinting a hidden magnetic tag, encoded with authentication information, within manufactured hardware during the part fabrication process. The revolutionary process holds the potential to expose counterfeit goods more easily by replacing physical tags — such as barcodes or quick response (QR) codes — with these hidden magnetic tags, which serve as permanent and unique identifiers. The project, titled “Embedded Information in Additively Manufactured Metals via Composition Gradients for Anti-Counterfeiting and Supply Chain Traceability,” is a faculty partner project supported by the SecureAmerica Institute."</em> <a href="https://today.tamu.edu/2022/12/20/using-additive-manufacturing-to-detect-counterfeit-parts/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers from Pittsburgh and Hong Kong print intricate, 2D and 3D patterns Carnegie Mellon University's Yongxin (Leon) Zhao and the Chinese University of Hong Kong's Shih-Chi Chen have a big idea for manufacturing nanodevices. Zhao's Biophotonics Lab develops novel techniques to study biological and pathological processes in cells and tissues. Through a process called expansion microscopy, the lab works to advance techniques to proportionally enlarge microscopic samples embedded in a hydrogel, allowing researchers to be able to view fine details without upgrading their microscopes. In 2019, an inspiring conversation with Shih-Chi Chen, who was visiting Carnegie Mellon as an invited speaker and is a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong's Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, sparked a collaboration between the two researchers. They thought they could use their combined expertise to find novel solutions for the long-standing challenge in microfabrication: developing ways to reduce the size of printable nanodevices to as small as 10s of nanometers or several atoms thick. Their solution is the opposite of expansion microscopy: create the 3D pattern of a material in hydrogel and shrink it for nanoscale resolution."</em> <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/mcs/news-events/2022/1223_zhao-nanofabrication.html">[...]</a>

To solve this, we are implementing Touchless Door Bells, which will lessen physical contact and sense the stranger’s distance and temperature so that the owner can be alerted that someone has arrived. Objective The ultrasonic sensor recognize the gesture of person and then employs an LM35 sensor to assess the temperature if the distance satisfies the specifications. The system buzzes, displays the relevant message, and notifies the owner whether or not to let the individual inside the house based on the temperature. The data is subsequently uploaded to Thingspeak, from which it is tweeted to the account of the owner on Twitter. Algorithum Step 1 : Power the nodemcu and connect the sensors Step 2: check the working of all the sensors like ultrasonic sensor, Lm35, buzzer, lcd Step 3:- The ultrasonic Sensor and the Lm35 Should be mounted properly Step 4 :- Dump the code to nodemcu Step 5:- As the gesture is detected by the ultrasonic Sensor the buzzer beeps once."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/01fe20bei007/touchless-doorbell-150975">[...]</a>

Nowadays, this amplifiers are again popular among audiophiles, and their price is usually very high. Valve amplifiers produce greater amounts of total harmonic distortion, but this type of distortion (2nd harmonic) is not as disturbing to the ear, and is perceived as a "warm" pleasant sound, especially when playing instruments where this amplifiers are still indispensable.

<p><em>"It’s now possible to build remote, low-power microcontroller projects that can operate indefinitely without batteries and still not crash, even if power is interrupted. Let that sink in. As an example, we’ll show you how to build a LoRa-based weather station that’s powered solely by solar panels. Its code is written in CircuitPython, running on a popular hobby-grade microcontroller board: the Adafruit Metro M0 Express. The novelty is that it can keep the state of the weather measurement program, even during periods of complete darkness when it runs out of power. This is called intermittent computing or perpetual computing, and it opens up a new world of sustainable electronics, where many applications will work well, and practically forever, without reliance on a battery."</em> <a href="https://makezine.com/projects/perpetual-battery-free-weather-station/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"I always spend a lot of time to decide what to eat since I have so many options and it's hard to choose one from them. Because of this, I want to design a product to decide it for me. Speaking of randomness, the slot machine is the first thing that comes to my mind. Therefore, I designed Spicy Roller, a cardboard slot machine with light and sound to help you choose your meals. Supplies - Cardboard from package box - 3 wooden sticks - 6 Bearings - Utility knife - 4 Pingpong balls - LED beads - Arduino Uno - wires - Adafruit Audio FX Sound Board + 2x2W Amp – WAV/OGG Trigger -16MB - Glue gun - Wire cutter - Scissor - Drill - Soldering kit - Printer - Sharpie marker - Scotch tape - Sharpie"</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Spicy-Roller-Meal-Desicion-Machine/">[...]</a>
