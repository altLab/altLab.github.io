<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1912, o físico nuclear norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyle_Benjamin_Borst">Lyle B. Borst</a>. Ele liderou a construção do Reactor de Investigação de Grafite (BGRR), no Laboratório Nacional de Brookhaven. Após o trabalho no Projecto Manhattan na II Guerra Mundial, organizou cerca de 1.300 cientistas, e falou perante o Congresso para manter a investigação atómica sob controlo civil, a fim de evitar uma corrida mundial ao armamento nuclear. Em 1946, com Karl Morgan, desenvolveu um crachá de filme para medir a exposição dos trabalhadores aos neutrões rápidos. O BGRR, concluído em 1949, foi o primeiro reactor construído exclusivamente para investigar a utilização da energia atómica em tempo de paz. No seu primeiro ano de funcionamento, Borst anunciou a produção de iodo radioactivo adequado para o tratamento do cancro da tiróide. Em 1952, ele explicou como o berílio-7 da fusão do hélio desencadeia super-novas.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1921, o químico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Banks_(chemist)">Robert L. Banks</a>. Ele co-descobriu o polímero cristalino de polipropileno, com J. Paul Hogan. Foram designados pela Phillips Petroleum, em 1946, para investigar formas de tomar os produtos de gás natural propileno e etileno e transformá-los em componentes úteis da gasolina. Em 5 de Junho de 1951, as suas experiências utilizando catalisadores produziram polipropileno - agora utilizado em fibras para cordas, carpetes interiores e exteriores e plásticos. Bancos e Hogan descobriram também como fazer um novo polietileno de alta densidade, mais resistente ao calor do que o polietileno anteriormente existente. Além disso, os seus catalisadores produziram o novo polietileno a apenas algumas centenas de psi de pressão em vez do processo radical livre existente, que exigia pressões de até 30.000 psi.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1921, o físico nuclear americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_York">Herbert F. York</a>. Ele iniciou a investigação científica em apoio à defesa nacional em 1943, quando começou a trabalhar em Oak Ridge, Tennessee, na separação electromagnética do urânio 235, como parte do Projecto Manhattan durante a II Guerra Mundial. Em 1952, tornou-se o primeiro director do Laboratório Lawrence Livermore. Saiu em Mar 1958 para se juntar ao Departamento de Defesa como cientista chefe da Agência de Projectos de Investigação Avançada, e rapidamente se tornou o director de investigação e engenharia do Departamento de Defesa (Dez. 1958). Regressou à Universidade da Califórnia em 1961, como chanceler e professor de Física. Foi negociador principal para a proibição total de testes durante a administração Carter.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1925, o engenheiro e físico holandês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_van_der_Meer">Simon van der Meer</a>. Ele, em conjunto com o físico italiano Carlo Rubbia, descobriu a partícula W e a partícula Z ao colidir protões e antiprotões, para os quais ambos os homens partilharam o Prémio Nobel da Física. Estas partículas subatómicas (unidades de matéria menores que um átomo) transmitem a fraca força nuclear, uma das quatro forças fundamentais na natureza. A descoberta apoiou a teoria unificada do electroweak apresentada nos anos 70. Trabalhando no CERN na Suíça, Van der Meer melhorou a concepção dos aceleradores de partículas utilizados, produzindo colisões entre feixes de partículas subatómicas. Inventou um dispositivo que monitorizaria e ajustaria o feixe de partículas com campos magnéticos correctores, através de um sistema de "kickers" colocados em torno do anel do acelerador.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1926, o físico norte-americano nascido na China <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsung-Dao_Lee">Tsung-Dao Lee</a>. Ele recebeu (com Chen Ning Yang) o Prémio Nobel da Física de 1957 pela sua "investigação penetrante" das violações do princípio da conservação da paridade (a qualidade da simetria de reflexão espacial das interacções das partículas subatómicas), o que levou a importantes descobertas sobre as partículas elementares. A conservação da paridade tinha sido anteriormente considerada como uma "lei" da natureza. (A paridade sustenta que as leis da física são as mesmas num sistema de coordenadas à direita do que num sistema à esquerda). A teoria foi posteriormente confirmada experimentalmente por Chien-Shiung Wu em observações de decadência beta.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1944, o cientista atmosférico indiano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veerabhadran_Ramanathan">Veerabhadran Ramanathan</a>. Ele descobriu a "Nuvem Castanha Asiática" - camadas errantes de poluição atmosférica tão largas como um continente e mais profundas do que o Grand Canyon. As partículas escuras nestas nuvens castanhas podem reduzir a precipitação, secar a superfície do planeta, arrefecer os trópicos e reduzir a luz solar - Global Dimming. Em 1975, o Ramanathan foi o primeiro a demonstrar que os CFC são gases com efeito de estufa importantes. Os seus cálculos mostraram que cada molécula de CFC na atmosfera contribui mais para o efeito de estufa que mais de 10.000 moléculas de dióxido de carbono. Nos anos 80, liderou um estudo que descobriu numerosos gases vestigiais que contribuem para o aquecimento global, e um estudo da NASA que demonstrou que as nuvens tinham um efeito líquido de arrefecimento global no planeta".</p>

<p>Em 1639, Jeremiah Horrocks, astrónomo e sacerdote inglês, mediu um trânsito de Vénus, o primeiro de sempre a ser observado. Aplicando a previsão de Kepler de que em 1631, Vénus transitaria pelo Sol, Horrocks calculou que estes trânsitos não ocorreram isoladamente, mas em pares, com oito anos de diferença. Assim, Horrocks preparou o seu equipamento para o trânsito seguinte que tinha assim previsto para este dia. O seu simples telescópio foi montado numa trave de madeira, para que pudesse projectar uma imagem solar sobre um pedaço de papel marcado com um círculo graduado de seis polegadas. A partir disto, ele fez medições e calculou que o valor para o paralaxe solar era menor do que anteriormente registado, e assim concluiu que o Sol estava mais longe da Terra do que anteriormente se pensava.</p>

<p>Em 1859, The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, o livro pioneiro de Darwin, foi publicado em Inglaterra para grande aclamação. O naturalista britânico Charles Darwin detalhou as provas científicas que tinha recolhido desde a sua viagem no Beagle, nos anos 1830. Ele apresentou a sua ideia de que as espécies são o resultado de uma evolução biológica gradual na qual a natureza encoraja, através da selecção natural, a propagação das espécies mais adequadas aos seus ambientes. Tinha sido levado a publicar nesta altura por Charles Lyell, que o aconselhou que Alfred Russel Wallace, um naturalista que trabalha no Bornéu, se aproximava das mesmas conclusões. Lyell acreditava que Darwin deveria publicar sem mais demora para estabelecer a prioridade.</p>

<p><em>"In a tale of cosmic proportions, the region is being transformed by the massive stars that live and die within it. A new image combining previously released data from three telescopes shows a region that includes the Orion Nebula, named after the mighty hunter from Greek mythology who was felled by a scorpion’s sting. But the story of how this dusty region came to be is just as dramatic. The Orion Nebula is located in the constellation Orion, which takes the appearance of a hunter raising a club and shield at an unseen target. Three stars in a line are together known as Orion’s belt; the region shown in the image aligns with another series of stars perpendicular to the belt, known as Orion’s sword. If you could see it in the sky, the region would appear about the size of the full moon."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasa-esa-reveal-tale-of-death-dust-in-orion-constellation">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Nexperia, the expert in essential semiconductors, today announced the expansion of its portfolio of Clip-bonded FlatPower (CFP) packaged diodes for industrial and automotive applications. The latest additions include four 650 V, 1 A parts available in CFP3 and CFP5 packages intended for use in onboard chargers (OBC) and inverters for electric vehicles, power converters, PV inverters, and power supplies in industrial applications. Standard products include the PNU65010ER (CFP3) and PNU65010EP (CFP5) while AEC-Q101 qualified products include the PNU65010ER-Q (CFP3) and PNU65010EP-Q (CFP5). These automotive and industrial-grade rectifiers provide the optimal tradeoff between ultrafast soft switching behavior and low forward voltage drop to help minimize power losses in high-frequency applications. Their small CFP footprint saves board space (compared to SMA/B packaged devices), enabling reliable, high-density designs without compromising on electrical performance. These 650 V diodes are already being used in several designs of Tier 1 automotive and industrial suppliers."</em> <a href="https://www.nexperia.com/about/news-events/press-releases/Nexperia-releases-ultrafast-650-V-Recovery-Rectifiers-for-automotive-and-industrial-applications.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The past several years have been an exciting time in quantum computing. Billions of dollars have been invested, and there's no shortage of advocates and detractors. Activity and momentum across the quantum community continue to grow. For proof, there have been a lot of recent headlines about increased qubit counts, commercially viable systems, roadmaps and startups. Some claim true commercialization is just around the corner. Despite very exciting developments in the field, a fault-tolerant 1 million-plus qubit machine and true commercial uses for quantum computing are 10 to 15 years from reality."</em> <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/opinion/journey-building-true-quantum-computer.html#gs.j3ckre#gs.j3ckre">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4497.html">STMicroelectronics launches a new advanced 6-axis IMU with embedded sensor fusion and AI</a></h2>

<p><em>"ST has introduced LSM6DSV16X, the flagship 6-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU) embedding ST’s Sensor Fusion Low Power (SFLP) technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and adaptive-self-configuration (ASC) for superior power optimization. The advanced architecture of the LSM6DSV16X enables sophisticated processing in the edge, making the device ideal for advanced 3D phone mapping, context awareness in laptops and tablets, reliable and precise gesture recognition for XR headsets, as well as always-on activity tracking. All the processing is done in the MEMS sensor itself, which also contains a triple sensing core to meet the differing needs of user-interface controls and optical/electronic image stabilization (OIS/EIS). The IC integrates an enhanced finite state machine (FSM), to detect fast events and custom gestures. In addition, the latest updates to ST’s innovative machine-learning core (MLC) raise the performance of inference algorithms such as human activity recognition. ST has published ready-to-use MLC and FSM algorithms on GitHub to help product designers cut time to market when implementing these advanced capabilities in new products."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4497.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-europa-clipper-gets-its-wheels-for-traveling-in-deep-space">NASA’s Europa Clipper Gets Its Wheels for Traveling in Deep Space</a></h2>

<p><em>"The enormous spacecraft that will head to Jupiter’s moon Europa uses four large reaction wheels to help keep it oriented. Just as NASA’s Mars rovers rely on robust wheels to roam the Red Planet and conduct science, some orbiters rely on wheels, too – in this case, reaction wheels – to stay pointed in the right direction. Engineers and technicians at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California recently installed four reaction wheels on Europa Clipper, which will rely on them during its journey at Jupiter’s icy moon Europa. When NASA’s spacecraft heads through deep space, slips into orbit around Jupiter, and collects science observations while flying dozens of times by Europa, the wheels rotate the orbiter so that its antennas can communicate with Earth and its science instruments, including cameras, can stay oriented. Two feet wide and made of steel, aluminum, and titanium, the wheels spin rapidly to create torque that causes the orbiter to rotate in the opposite direction. Isaac Newton’s third law of motion also applies in deep space and explains the underlying phenomenon: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-europa-clipper-gets-its-wheels-for-traveling-in-deep-space">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Amid fierce industry competition, Samsung aims to overtake TSMC in 3-nanometer technology. Samsung Electronics Co., the world’s largest memory chipmaker, will make semiconductors with the industry’s most advanced 3-nanometer process node for its clients, including Nvidia, Qualcomm Technologies, IBM and China’s Baidu. The South Korean tech giant is jointly developing advanced chips with five to six fabless clients for supply in large quantities from as early as 2024, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Samsung will use its 3 nm technology to manufacture graphics processing units (GPUs) for Nvidia, central processing units (CPUs) for IBM, smartphone application processors for Qualcomm and artificial intelligence chips used in cloud data centers for Baidu, sources said. These customers are known to have selected Samsung as a consignment producer in consideration of the Korean chipmaker’s 3 nm process technology as well as their need to secure multiple suppliers, the sources said. Market watchers said Samsung hopes to leverage its 3 nm technology to overtake its bigger foundry rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

<h2><a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/2022/11/23/artemis-i-flight-day-eight-orion-exits-the-lunar-sphere-of-influence/">Artemis I – Flight Day Eight: Orion Exits the Lunar Sphere Of Influence</a></h2>

<p><em>"On the eighth day of its mission, Orion continues to travel farther away from the Moon as it prepares to enter a distant retrograde orbit. The orbit is “distant” in the sense that it’s at a high altitude from the surface of the Moon, and it’s “retrograde” because Orion will travel around the Moon opposite the direction the Moon travels around Earth. Orion exited the gravitational sphere of influence of the Moon Tuesday, Nov. 22, at 9:49 p.m. CST at a lunar altitude of 39,993 miles.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and its unparalleled images of our Universe offer us a new first: by combining several instruments, it draws a molecular and chemical portrait of the atmosphere of the exoplanet WASP-39b. It highlights the presence of water, carbon dioxide and especially, for the first time, sulfur dioxide created through reactions triggered by the light of its host star. These results can be found in five scientific articles. Researchers from UNIGE and the PlanetS National Centre of Competence in Research have contributed to these studies.

The study by researchers at The University of Texas at Austin and published today in the journal iScience is an important step forward for brain-machine interfaces — computer systems that turn mind activity into action. The concept of a thought-powered wheelchair has been studied for years, but most projects have used non-disabled subjects or stimuli that leads the device to more or less control the person rather than the other way around. In this case, three individuals with tetraplegia, the inability to move their arms and legs due to spinal injuries, operated the wheelchair in a cluttered, natural environment to varying degrees of success. The interface recorded their brain activity, and a machine-learning algorithim translated it into commands that drove the wheelchair. The researchers said this is a sign of future commercial viability for mind-powered wheelchairs that can assist people with limited motor function."</em> <a href="https://news.utexas.edu/2022/11/18/brain-powered-wheelchair-shows-real-world-promise/">[...]</a>

As described in a paper recently published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, this work, done in collaboration with Princeton University, shows how molecules containing these so-called free radicals could be used in a whole new class of reactions. “Most reactions involving free radicals take place at the site of the unpaired electron,” explained Brookhaven Lab chemist Matthew Bird, one of the co-corresponding authors on the paper. The Princeton team had become experts in using free radicals for a range of synthetic applications, such as polymer upcycling. But they’ve wondered whether free radicals might influence reactivity on other parts of the molecule as well, by pulling electrons away from those more distant locations. “Our measurements show that these radicals can exert powerful ‘electron-withdrawing’ effects that make other parts of the molecule more reactive,” Bird said."</em> <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=120958">[...]</a>

The data provide a unique view of a key region in the solar corona to which researchers have had little access so far. There, the team has for the first time captured a dynamic web-like network of elongated, interwoven plasma structures. Together with data from other space probes and extensive computer simulations, a clear picture emerges: where the elongated coronal web structures interact, magnetic energy is discharged - and particles escape into space.

<p><em>"Researchers make progress toward groups of robots that could build almost anything, including buildings, vehicles, and even bigger robots. Researchers at MIT have made significant steps toward creating robots that could practically and economically assemble nearly anything, including things much larger than themselves, from vehicles to buildings to larger robots. The new work, from MIT’s Center for Bits and Atoms (CBA), builds on years of research, including recent studies demonstrating that objects such as a deformable airplane wing and a functional racing car could be assembled from tiny identical lightweight pieces — and that robotic devices could be built to carry out some of this assembly work. Now, the team has shown that both the assembler bots and the components of the structure being built can all be made of the same subunits, and the robots can move independently in large numbers to accomplish large-scale assemblies quickly. The new work is reported in the journal Nature Communications Engineering, in a paper by CBA doctoral student Amira Abdel-Rahman, Professor and CBA Director Neil Gershenfeld, and three others. A fully autonomous self-replicating robot assembly system capable of both assembling larger structures, including larger robots, and planning the best construction sequence is still years away, Gershenfeld says."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/assembler-robots-structures-voxels-1122">[...]</a>

<p><em>"For the first time in experimental history, researchers at the Institute for Quantum Computing (IQC) have created a device that generates twisted neutrons with well-defined orbital angular momentum. Previously considered an impossibility, this groundbreaking scientific accomplishment provides a brand new avenue for researchers to study the development of next-generation quantum materials with applications ranging from quantum computing to identifying and solving new problems in fundamental physics. “Neutrons are a powerful probe for the characterization of emerging quantum materials because they have several unique features,” said Dr. Dusan Sarenac, research associate with IQC and technical lead, Transformative Quantum Technologies at the University of Waterloo. “They have nanometer-sized wavelengths, electrical neutrality, and a relatively large mass. These features mean neutrons can pass through materials that X-rays and light cannot.” While methods for the experimental production and analysis of orbital angular momentum in photons and electrons are well-studied, a device design using neutrons has never been demonstrated until now. Because of their distinct characteristics, the researchers had to construct new devices and create novel methods for working with neutrons."</em> <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/news/media/new-quantum-tool-developed-groundbreaking-experimental">[...]</a>

A discovery by MIT researchers could finally unlock the door to the design of a new kind of rechargeable lithium battery that is more lightweight, compact, and safe than current versions, and that has been pursued by labs around the world for years. The key to this potential leap in battery technology is replacing the liquid electrolyte that sits between the positive and negative electrodes with a much thinner, lighter layer of solid ceramic material, and replacing one of the electrodes with solid lithium metal. This would greatly reduce the overall size and weight of the battery and remove the safety risk associated with liquid electrolytes, which are flammable.

<p><em>"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and UC Santa Cruz scientists have detected a previously hypothesized class of nitrogen fixation in the surface ocean. Nitrogen scarcity limits the growth of ocean phytoplankton, a globally important carbon sink and the base of the marine food web. Nitrogen that can be used by phytoplankton generally has a very low concentration in the sunlit layer of the open ocean, but the two primary sources of new nitrogen in the surface oceans are nitrate coming up from the deep, and biological nitrogen “fixation” of N2 gas from the atmosphere by some cyanobacteria. In new research published in Nature Communications, the team found that an alternative class of nitrogen fixers, which are not photosynthetic, are associated with marine particles and fix nitrogen in some parts of the ocean. “For over three decades, scientists have known this alternative class of nitrogen-fixing organism is widespread in the surface oceans, but we lacked direct evidence that they can actually fix nitrogen until now,” said lead author and former LLNL graduate scholar Katie Harding. Harding was a graduate student at UC Santa Cruz in the laboratory of Jonathan Zehr, who has spent decades studying marine nitrogen fixation."</em> <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/news/scientists-use-carbon-detect-new-nitrogen-source-open-ocean">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Through extensive model calculations, physicists at Goethe University Frankfurt have reached general conclusions about the internal structure of neutron stars, where matter reaches enormous densities: depending on their mass, the stars can have a core that is either very stiff or very soft. The findings were published simultaneously in two articles today. So far, little is known about the interior of neutron stars, those extremely compact objects that can form after the death of a star: the mass of our sun or even more is compressed into a sphere with the diameter of a large city. Since their discovery more than 60 years ago, scientists have been trying to decipher their structure. The greatest challenge is to simulate the extreme conditions inside neutron stars, as they can hardly be recreated on Earth in the laboratory. There are therefore many models in which various properties – from density and temperature – are described with the help of so-called equations of state."</em> <a href="https://aktuelles.uni-frankfurt.de/englisch/cosmic-chocolate-pralines-general-neutron-star-structure-revealed/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This Instructable describes how to build an android head. It uses an Arduino Nano as a servo controller. When I visited an exhibition of robots at our local museum, one of the most popular exhibits was a robot head that tracked people's faces and tried to copy their expressions (maybe this one). I wondered how it worked and whether I could do something similar. When you build a humanoid robot head, it's hard to know where to start. I looked at other examples and couldn't work out how their chassis was built or how the actuators were attached."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Android-Robot-Head-Hardware/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"If you've ever looked at prices for prosthetic arms, you may have noticed that they can cost upwards of $5000, with more advanced myoelectric controlled arms priced at over $20,000. Such prices are not ideal considering that over 80 percent of amputees are from developing countries where access to prosthetic limbs is limited by lack of health care and financial resources. With 3D printing, however, we can create more cost-effective prosthetics that can better address the need of amputees. Some of the major advantages of 3D printing are rapid prototyping, customization of size, and the flexibility to replace parts by printing new ones. This project combines a 3D printed robotic arm from an open source project called InMoov with an Arduino compatible muscle sensor from Advancer Technologies. While this arm may not be as advanced as a $20,000 prosthetic limb, it is still a proof of concept that demonstrates the possibility of creating cost effective limbs that can provide comparable functionality at a fraction of the price."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/3D-Printed-EMG-Prosthetic-Hand/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"I am very found of making robots and wanted to gift one to my cousin who is just 7 years old. There are many robots on the Internet, I wanted to make a robot which would easily fit in my hand, and the design should be appealing to the child. I wanted to keep everything simple, so I went with a circular shape design like to 3PI Robot. I really liked to 3PI Bot design and wanted to make something similar. So, without further adieu let's get started. Supplies The Main Items necessary for the BOT are: - 3D Printer (optional) - 9V/1 Adapter x1 for charging the robot - 18650 Batteries x2 - 18650 for 2 Battery Holder x1 - N20 Gear Motor with Bracket Holders x2 - N20 Gear Motor Wheels x2 - Arduino Pro Mini x1 - FTDI Module (This is for Programming the Arduino Pro Mini) - DRV8833 Adafruit Module x1 - 5V Buzzer x1 - RN42 Bluetooth Module (you can also use HC05/HC06) - BQ24005 IC x1 - Multi-color Flashing LEDs x6 - etc."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Handheld-BOT/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In a previous instructable, I have presented a concept for making a “linear” binary clock from a standard WS2812 LED strip and an ATtiny microprocessor. The design of that clock was not that great… …which is why I made a new version using an LED ring. This clock will show the hours, minutes, and seconds of the current time in a binary style on the 16 LEDs of the ring - 4 representing the hours (blue), 6 representing the minutes (pink) and 6 representing the seconds (green). You will get the correct time, if you just add the single 2x values of each LED. As an example, it is 11:36:49 a.m. in the picture above. Hence, the clock lights the blue LEDs “0”, “1”, and “3” for the hours (= 20 + 21 + 23 = 1 + 2 + 8 = 11)."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/A-Circular-Binary-Clock/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Hey everyone, what's up? So here's something super interesting and cool: SANDWICH DOT IO. It's a Raspberry Pi system with onboard power, a dedicated cooling layer, and even RGB LEDs for aesthetics. This setup was created to address a problem I encountered while working on a Raspberry Pi-based project: I wanted to create a small game emulator using the RPI 3B+, but the problem was the power supply. A 5V adaptor was used for powering the Raspberry Pi. A fan was also required to keep the Pi cool, but I had to add another 5V supply for it as we cannot plug it directly into the 5V of the Raspberry Pi."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Sandwich-Dot-IO/">[...]</a>
