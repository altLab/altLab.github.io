<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1719, o inventor escocês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Meikle">Andrew Meikle</a>. Ele é responsável pela invenção da debulhadora de tambor. As suas tentativas de 1778 de construir uma debulhadora foram infrutíferas, com base em desenhos anteriores de outros que esfregavam o grão. A partir de cerca de 1784, Meikle desenvolveu em vez disso uma máquina usando a ideia de um forte tambor giratório e barras de batedeira fixas para esculpir o grão como uma máquina de espadelar do seu tempo usada para bater as fibras das plantas de linho. Poupando muito trabalho manual, a máquina separou o grão, das espigas, caules ou cascas e limpou-o. Patenteou-a 9 de Abril de 1788.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1811, o químico inglês-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_William_Draper">John William Draper</a>. Ele foi pioneiro na fotoquímica. Ele reconheceu que a luz iniciou reacções químicas como moléculas absorvendo a energia da luz. O Draper Point é o nome dado ao ponto em que todas as substâncias brilham um vermelho baço (cerca de 525 graus C.). Ele descreveu o efeito do aumento da temperatura como a adição de cada vez mais da região da luz visível produziu um brilho branco (1847). O seu interesse em espectroscopia e fotografia foi aplicado para dar a primeira fotografia astronómica. O seu tema era a lua (1840). Também estudou fotografias do espectro solar para mostrar que continha tanto luz infravermelha como ultravioleta. As suas fotografias de pessoas incluem o retrato fotográfico sobrevivente mais antigo (1840), e ele foi um dos primeiros a produzir microfotografias.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1861, o engenheiro electrotécnico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Cooper_Hewitt">Peter Cooper Hewitt</a>. Ele inventou a lâmpada de vapor de mercúrio, um importante precursor das lâmpadas fluorescentes. Ele estudou a produção de luz utilizando descargas eléctricas (enquanto Thomas Edison ainda estava a desenvolver filamentos incandescentes). Os tubos cheios de mercúrio que desenvolveu a partir de finais da década de 1890, emitiam uma luz azul-verde pouco atractiva. Embora inadequado em casas, o seu brilho ganhou ampla adopção pelos estúdios fotográficos porque o filme a preto e branco do tempo necessitava apenas de luz brilhante, apesar da sua cor. Havia muitas outras utilizações industriais para a lâmpada. A sua empresa de fabrico (est. 1902) foi comprada pela General Electric em 1919, que produziu um novo desenho em 1933. Em 17 de Setembro de 1901, ele tirou as suas primeiras oito patentes de lâmpada de vapor de mercúrio.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1961, o físico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Leonard_Schawlow">Arthur Leonard Schawlow</a>. Ele partilhou (com os investigadores independentes Nicolaas Bloembergen e Kai Siegbahn) o Prémio Nobel da Física de 1981 pelo seu trabalho no desenvolvimento do laser e na espectroscopia laser. Com Theodor Hänsch, Schawlow utilizou lasers de corantes sintonizáveis para espectroscopia de alta resolução. No início da sua carreira, Schawlow colaborou com Charles Townes na investigação dos princípios de maser. Embora não tenha participado no Prémio Nobel da Física de 1964, que foi atribuído a Townes e a dois cientistas russos pela sua investigação sobre maser e laser, Schawlow ainda é considerado como um co-inventor do laser".</p>

<p>Faz hoje trinta anos que era lançado, pela id Software, o <a href="https://beta.wolf3d.net/">Wolfenstein 3D</a>, um emocionante jogo FPS, ambientado durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial. Abriu novo terreno para jogos de PC baseados na acção e continuou uma série de sucessos crescentes para a id Software. Os seus criadores mais conhecidos são <a href="https://wl6.fandom.com/wiki/John_Carmack">John Carmack</a>, <a href="https://wl6.fandom.com/wiki/John_Romero">John Romero</a>, e <a href="https://wl6.fandom.com/wiki/Tom_Hall">Tom Hall</a>. Disponibilizado a 5 de maio de 1992 este seria o início de uma série de jogos deste tipo que ainda hoje têm uma legião de fãs.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou a Rocket Lab lançou em órbita 34 satélites e apanha o foguetão de volta do espaço com a ajuda de um helicóptero. O primeiro estágio do foguetão Electron foi recuperado usando um helicóptero que o aguardava depois de ter aberto um paraquedas para estabilizar a sua velocidade.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou, o telescópio espacial James Webb concluiu a sua fase de alinhamento dos espelhos com sucesso. Para este teste, o telescópio apontou para parte da Grande Nuvem de Magalhães, uma pequena galáxia satélite da Via Láctea, fornecendo um campo denso de centenas de milhares de estrelas através de todos os sensores do observatório. Estes dados de imagem são utilizados não só para avaliar a nitidez da imagem, mas também para medir e calibrar com precisão distorções e alinhamentos subtis da imagem entre os sensores do instrumento como parte do processo global de calibração de instrumentos do telescópio.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/new-blog-post-8/">Rocket Lab Successfully Deploys 34 Satellites and Catches Rocket Booster Returning from Space with Helicopter</a></h2>

<p><em>"Rocket Lab (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a leading launch and space systems company, has successfully launched its 26th Electron mission, deploying 34 satellites to orbit. Rocket Lab has now deployed a total of 146 satellites to orbit with the Electron launch vehicle. The “There And Back Again” mission also saw Rocket Lab complete a mid-air capture of the Electron booster with a helicopter for the first time. After launching to space, Electron’s first stage returned to Earth under a parachute. At 6,500 ft, Rocket Lab’s Sikorsky S-92 helicopter rendezvoused with the returning stage and used a hook on a long line to capture the parachute line. The mid-air capture is a major milestone in Rocket Lab’s pursuit to make Electron a reusable rocket to increase launch frequency and reduce launch costs for small satellites."</em> <a href="https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/new-blog-post-8/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"It is official, alignment of NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope is now complete. The alignment of the telescope across all of Webb’s instruments can be seen in a series of images that captures the observatory’s full field of view. Featured in this video are engineering images demonstrating the sharp focus of each instrument. For this test, Webb pointed at part of the Large Magellanic Cloud, a small satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, providing a dense field of hundreds of thousands of stars across all the observatory’s sensors. The sizes and positions of the images shown depict the relative arrangement of each of Webb’s instruments in the telescope’s focal plane, each pointing at a slightly offset part of the sky relative to one another. Webb’s three imaging instruments are NIRCam (images shown here at a wavelength of 2 microns), NIRISS (image shown here at 1.5 microns), and MIRI (shown at 7.7 microns, a longer wavelength revealing emission from interstellar clouds as well as starlight)."</em> <a href="https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/14150">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Computer scientists at UC Riverside can detect manipulated facial expressions in deepfake videos with higher accuracy than current state-of-the-art methods. The method also works as well as current methods in cases where the facial identity, but not the expression, has been swapped, leading to a generalized approach to detect any kind of facial manipulation. The achievement brings researchers a step closer to developing automated tools for detecting manipulated videos that contain propaganda or misinformation. Developments in video editing software have made it easy to exchange the face of one person for another and alter the expressions on original faces. As unscrupulous leaders and individuals deploy manipulated videos to sway political or social opinions, the ability to identify these videos is considered by many essential to protecting free democracies. Methods exist that can detect with reasonable accuracy when faces have been swapped."</em> <a href="https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2022/05/03/new-method-detects-deepfake-videos-99-accuracy">[...]</a>

Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) have developed a single-material, single-stimuli microstructure that can outmaneuver even living cilia. These programmable, micron-scale structures could be used for a range of applications, including soft robotics, biocompatible medical devices, and even dynamic information encryption. The research is published in Nature. “Innovations in adaptive self-regulated materials that are capable of a diverse set of programmed motions represent a very active field, which is being tackled by interdisciplinary teams of scientists and engineers,” said Joanna Aizenberg, the Amy Smith Berylson Professor of Materials Science and Professor of Chemistry &amp; Chemical Biology at SEAS and senior author of the paper."</em> <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2022/05/self-propelled-endlessly-programmable-artificial-cilia">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The molecules of life, DNA, replicate with astounding precision, yet this process is not immune to mistakes and can lead to mutations. Using sophisticated computer modelling, a team of physicists and chemists at the University of Surrey have shown that such errors in copying can arise due to the strange rules of the quantum world. The two strands of the famous DNA double helix are linked together by subatomic particles called protons – the nuclei of atoms of hydrogen – which provide the glue that bonds molecules called bases together. These so-called hydrogen bonds are like the rungs of a twisted ladder that makes up the double helix structure discovered in 1952 by James Watson and Francis Crick based on the work of Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins. Normally, these DNA bases (called A, C, T and G) follow strict rules on how they bond together: A always bonds to T and C always to G. This strict pairing is determined by the molecules' shape, fitting them together like pieces in a jigsaw, but if the nature of the hydrogen bonds changes slightly, this can cause the pairing rule to break down, leading to the wrong bases being linked and hence a mutation. Although predicted by Crick and Watson, it is only now that sophisticated computational modelling has been able to quantify the process accurately."</em> <a href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk/news/quantum-mechanics-could-explain-why-dna-can-spontaneously-mutate">[...]</a>

Victor Klimov, lead Los Alamos National Laboratory researcher on this project, said, “What we have done is to use a process of so-called ‘spin-exchange,’ enabled by adding manganese to specially sized quantum dots, to rapidly push energy from the manganese ions to the quantum dot electron. This eventually allows the electron to reach a ‘free’ unbound state and break loose.” The new process employs a combined energy of multiple manganese ions.

<p><em>"Inspired by an ancient light trick, technology could enable a new type of 3D display For the first time, researchers have used liquid crystals to create a flat magic window — a transparent device that produces a hidden image when light shines on it. The technology represents a new twist on a very old light trick. Thousands of years ago, artisans in China and Japan made bronze mirrors that looked like a normal flat mirror while viewing one’s reflection but formed another image when hit by direct sunlight. It took until the early 20th century for scientists to understand that these devices work because an image cast into the back of the mirror creates small surface variations that cause the image to form – and it took until now for engineers to apply the same principle to liquid crystals for high-tech displays. “The magic window we created appears perfectly flat to the naked eye but, in fact, has slight variations that create an image in response to light,” said research team leader Felix Hufnagel from the University of Ottawa. “By designing the window to be relatively smooth, the image that is created can be seen over a large range of distances from the window.” In Optica, Optica Publishing Group’s journal for high-impact research, Hufnagel and colleagues describe the process they developed for creating transparent liquid crystal magic windows that can produce any desired image."</em> <a href="https://www.optica.org/en-us/about/newsroom/news_releases/2022/may/researchers_create_flat_magic_window_with_liquid_c/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"With the recent launch of Windows 11 Microsoft also made having a hardware TPM module mandatory. Although this technology is not new (it was introduced in Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016), now, that most people can’t upgrade to Windows 11, it will (slowly) become mainstream. (My personal opinion on it is that is probably a step in the right direction, but Microsoft could have handled mandating it better..) Several months ago, when I heard about this new requirement, I checked how much this upgrade for me would cost. At the time prices for a TPM2.0 module for my motherboard (Gigabyte AORUS GAMING 3) started at around €150, which is not much less then, but definitely comparable with, the price of the motherboard itself. Not prepared to pay that much for a “free” Windows 11 upgrade, I started to look into if and how I could create the same thing on my own. Research, things I learnt During the research for this module I learnt that these modules are not identical for each motherboard brand and model, which makes it somewhat difficult for the average user to buy the correct one."</em> <a href="https://diy.viktak.com/2022/04/home-made-tpm2-0-module.html">[...]</a>

The panel meter shows the time, here from 0 to 12, and a yellow LED on the breadboard tells us whether it is PM or not. The three pushbuttons on the breadboard are used like this: ON/OFF: The leftmost button turns the clock off or on. When it is off it still keeps the time, though, because the microcontroller goes into an ultra-low power mode that is also called sleep mode, and we will talk much more about it later.

<p><em>"Hello builders, that is my redesign of the British army's original Mark IV tank from WWI. I hope you enjoy it. I designed this robot for half a year. It was my first thing I ever designed. I had a lot of setbacks, but I finally made it. I build it for a science competition, but I didn't nail it in time."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/WiFi-Controlled-Mark-IV-Tank-3D-Printed/">[...]</a>
