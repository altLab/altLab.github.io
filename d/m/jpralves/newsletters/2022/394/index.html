<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1597, o astrónomo e matemático inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Gellibrand">Henry Gellibrand</a>. Ele co-descobriu (com John Marr) a variação secular geomagnética. Isto refere-se à declinação magnética do campo magnético da Terra, o ângulo entre o norte magnético e o norte verdadeiro, mudando numa escala temporal a longo prazo ao longo dos anos. Ele detectou que a direcção de uma agulha de bússola em Londres tinha mudado em sete graus ao longo de um período de meio século. Tornou-se professor de astronomia no Gresham College, Londres, a 2 de Janeiro de 1627. Os seus manuais de navegação ajudaram a melhorar a navegação inglesa na altura. Usando manuscritos deixados inacabados quando o seu amigo Henry Briggs morreu (1630), completou o volume dois da Trigonometrica Britannica de Briggs, em 1633. Gellibrand publicou A Discourse Mathematicall on the Variation of the Magneticall Needle, em 1635.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1790, o astrónomo o matemático alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Ferdinand_M%C3%B6bius">August Ferdinand Möbius</a>. Ele ficou conhecido pelo seu trabalho em geometria analítica e topologia, especialmente recordado como um dos descobridores da faixa de Möbius, que tinha descoberto em 1858. Uma faixa de Möbius é uma superfície bidimensional com apenas um lado. Pode ser construída em três dimensões, como se segue. Pegar numa tira rectangular de papel e unir as duas extremidades da tira de modo a que esta tenha uma torção de 180 graus. É agora possível começar num ponto A da superfície e traçar um caminho que passa pelo ponto que aparentemente se encontra do outro lado da superfície de A. Embora a sua obra mais famosa seja em matemática, Möbius publicou um trabalho importante em astronomia.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1835, o físico e engenheiro electrotécnico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Arnold_Anthony">William Arnold Anthony</a>. Ele iniciou e desenvolveu um dos primeiros cursos de engenharia electrotécnica nos EUA (1883), enquanto ensinava no Departamento de Física da Universidade de Cornell, Ithaca, N.Y. Durante 1872-75, Anthony, com a ajuda do estudante George Moler, construiu o primeiro dínamo americano Gramme para corrente contínua, utilizado para alimentar lâmpadas de arco que iluminavam o campus de Cornell, o primeiro sistema americano de iluminação eléctrica ao ar livre. Anthony também construiu um galvanómetro tangente mamute, um dispositivo que utilizava o campo magnético terrestre para a medição de corrente. Ele concebeu o dínamo para o primeiro sistema de distribuição de electricidade subterrânea. Anthony contribuiu para o desenvolvimento de lâmpadas eléctricas cheias de gás.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1850, o químico industrial escocês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Beilby">George Beilby</a>. Ele desenvolveu (1890) o processo de fabrico de cianeto de potássio (amplamente utilizado para extrair ouro de minério de baixa qualidade) passando amoníaco sobre uma mistura aquecida de carvão vegetal e carbonato de potássio. Beilby entrou na indústria do xisto betuminoso em 1869 e aumentou consideravelmente o rendimento da parafina e do amoníaco ao introduzir a retorta contínua. Notando a destruição de metais pelo amoníaco a altas temperaturas, Beilby pesquisou o fluxo de sólidos. Ele inferiu que quando um sólido é causado a fluir, como no polimento, a superfície cristalina é decomposta numa camada mais dura e mais densa. Embora muito criticada, esta teoria explicou o endurecimento dos metais sob trabalho a frio e deu um estímulo valioso para a continuação da investigação.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1855, o médico e inventor alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Gassner">Carl Gassner</a>. Ele foi especialista em olhos e ouvidos, mas é mais conhecido por inventar a primeira bateria de células secas (1886). Utilizava o mesmo princípio que a célula de Leclanché. Uma barra de manganês de carbono era o ânodo. Em vez de um electrólito líquido, concebeu uma forma de pasta porosa com amoníaco sal, gesso, cloreto de zinco e água. Todos foram selados numa lata de zinco que também era o cátodo. As células Lechanché tinham sido utilizadas para campainhas eléctricas, mas estas eram vulneráveis à quebra e derramamento, bem como necessitavam de água fresca adicionada periodicamente. Para ajudar um armazenista, Gessner concebeu a sua célula seca como uma alternativa melhor. Obteve uma patente alemã (8 Abr 1886), uma patente provisória britânica (No. 18,754 em 22 Dez 1888), e uma patente americana (No. 373,064 em 15 Nov 1887), bem como patentes na Áustria-Hungria, Bélgica e França.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1865, o astrónomo canadiano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stanley_Plaskett">John Stanley Plaskett</a>. Ele ficou conhecido pela sua concepção especializada de instrumentos e pelas suas extensas observações espectroscópicas. Concebeu um espectrógrafo excepcionalmente eficiente para o refractor de 15 polegadas e mediu velocidades radiais e encontrou órbitas de estrelas binárias espectroscópicas. Concebeu e supervisionou a construção do reflector de 72 polegadas construído para o novo Observatório Astrofísico Dominion em Vitória e foi nomeado o seu primeiro director em 1917. Aí estendeu o trabalho sobre velocidades radiais e binários espectroscópicos e estudou espectros de estrelas tipo O e B. Na década de 1930 publicou a primeira análise detalhada da rotação da Via Láctea, demonstrando que o sol está a dois terços do centro da nossa galáxia sobre a qual gira uma vez em 220 milhões de anos.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1865, o químico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Merriam_Burton">William Merriam Burton</a>. Ele concebeu o primeiro processo de craqueamento térmico que mais do que duplicou a proporção de produção de gasolina a partir do petróleo bruto, utilizando calor elevado e alta pressão. A mistura de petróleo bruto de vários hidrocarbonetos pode ser separada em vários grupos de constituintes por meios físicos, normalmente a destilação. O seu processo de craqueamento térmico (patenteado a 7 de Janeiro de 1913, nº 1.049.667) reformou quimicamente moléculas mais longas de componentes menos voláteis em moléculas mais pequenas, duplicando assim o rendimento da gasolina necessária para alimentar a indústria automóvel. Durante os seus primeiros 15 anos de utilização, o processo poupou mais de mil milhões de barris de petróleo bruto. Em 1937, a invenção do cracking catalítico superou o processo Burton, mas continua em larga utilização.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1902, o físico húngaro-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Wigner">Eugene Wigner</a>. Ele partilhou o Prémio Nobel da Física de 1963 (com Maria Goeppert Mayer e Johannes Hans Jensen) pela sua visão da mecânica quântica, pelas suas contribuições para a teoria do núcleo atómico e das partículas elementares, particularmente através da descoberta e aplicação de princípios de simetria fundamentais. Fez muitas contribuições para a física nuclear e desempenhou um papel proeminente no desenvolvimento da bomba atómica e da energia nuclear.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1906, o engenheiro, piloto de automóveis de corrida e industrial japonês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soichiro_Honda">Soichiro Honda</a>. Ele fundou a Honda Motor Company, fabricante de motociclos e automóveis. Nascido em Iwata Gun, Japão, a sua carreira começou como aprendiz de garagem (1922), o que levou à abertura da sua própria garagem em 1928. Começou a fabricar com uma fábrica de anéis de pistão (1934) que se expandiu para motocicletas em 1948, seguida pelo lançamento de um carro desportivo e de um camião ligeiro em 1963. Soichiro Honda reformou-se em 1973, e foi nomeado "conselheiro supremo".</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1922, o bioquímico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cohen_(biochemist)">Stanley Cohen</a>. Ele partilhou (com Rita Levi-Montalcini) o Prémio Nobel da Fisiologia ou Medicina de 1986 "pelas suas descobertas de factores de crescimento". A sua investigação foi sobre o factor de crescimento epidérmico (EGF), uma proteína produzida no corpo que está envolvida no crescimento celular normal, diferenciação, cura de feridas, e outros eventos de desenvolvimento no corpo. Por exemplo, descobriu que em ratos recém-nascidos, causaria uma dentição mais precoce e abertura dos olhos. EGF e NGF (o factor de crescimento nervoso estudado por Levi-Montalcini) foram os primeiros de uma série de substâncias de sinal regulador de crescimento agora conhecidas. A sua descoberta levou a uma maior compreensão dos resultados de muitas doenças, tais como malformações do desenvolvimento, alterações degenerativas na demência senil, atraso na cicatrização de feridas e tumores.</p>

<p>Em 1869, o Canal de Suez no Egipto foi aberto com uma cerimónia em que participou a Imperatriz francesa Eugénie (esposa de Napoleão III). O canal de 100 milhas de comprimento atravessa o Istmo do Suez, ligando assim os mares Mediterrâneo e Vermelho, e fornecendo uma rota de transporte directo para o comércio entre a Europa e a Ásia. A sua construção foi realizada pelo engenheiro francês, Ferdinand de Lesseps. Como antigo cônsul francês no Cairo, de Lesseps tinha feito um acordo (1854) com o governador otomano do Egipto, permitindo a formação da Companhia do Canal de Suez (1856) com os direitos de construir e operar o canal durante 99 anos. A escavação começou a 24 de Abril de 1859, à mão, com trabalhos forçados. O progresso melhorou com dragas mecânicas e pás a vapor europeias, mas foi atrasado por disputas laborais e por uma epidemia de cólera.</p>

<p>Em 1970, foi emitida uma patente americana para o rato de computador - um "X-Y Position Indicator for a Display System" (No. 3541541). O inventor foi Doug Engelbart. No laboratório, ele e os seus colegas chamaram-lhe "rato", depois do seu cabo de cauda. O primeiro rato era um simples bloco de madeira escavado, com um único botão de pressão no topo. Engelbart tinha concebido isto como uma ferramenta para seleccionar o texto, movê-lo e manipulá-lo de outra forma. Era um elemento chave do seu projecto maior - o NLS (oN Line System), um computador que ele e alguns colegas do Stanford Research Institute tinham construído. O NLS também permitiu que dois ou mais utilizadores trabalhassem no mesmo documento a partir de estações de trabalho diferentes.</p>

<p>E nesta semana que passou foi lançado o Fedora 37, uma grande actualização desta distro patrocinada pela Red Hat que vem com algumas das mais recentes e maiores tecnologias GNU/Linux. O Fedora Linux 37 é uma das distribuições GNU/Linux mais previstas do ano e não desilude os fãs. É suportada pelo mais recente e maior kernel Linux 6.0 e utiliza o mais recente ambiente de trabalho GNOME 43 por defeito para a sua edição emblemática da Estação de Trabalho Fedora. O Fedora 37 também vem com boas notícias para os utilizadores do Raspberry Pi 4, uma vez que este lançamento introduz o apoio oficial ao popular computador, incluindo as variantes 4B, 400, e CM4, graças à implementação de gráficos acelerados utilizando a GPU V3D, juntamente com algumas melhorias gerais mais amplas.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou foi feito o lançamento bem sucedido do Sistema de Lançamento Espacial da NASA (SLS), o foguetão mais poderoso do mundo, a nave espacial Orion da agência está a caminho da Lua como parte do programa Artemis. Transportando um Orion não-tripulado, o SLS descolou para o seu teste de voo de estreia à 1:47 da manhã de quarta-feira EST do Launch Pad 39B no Centro Espacial Kennedy da NASA, na Florida. O lançamento é a primeira etapa de uma missão na qual Orion está planeado viajar aproximadamente 40.000 milhas para além da Lua e regressar à Terra ao longo de 25,5 dias. Conhecida como Artemis I, a missão é uma parte crítica da abordagem de exploração da NASA da Lua a Marte, na qual a agência explora em benefício da humanidade. É um teste importante para a agência antes de voar como astronautas na missão Artemis II.</p>

Now, a group of researchers from Japan investigate the stability and superconductivity of ternary hydrides under high pressures using supercomputer simulations, predicting three compounds with superconductivity at temperatures less than 170 K. These results hold promising for realizing energy-efficient societies. There has been a lot of progress and development in the superconductivity (zero electrical resistance) front owing to its wide range of applications in MRI machines, particle accelerators, and low-loss power cables. However, its widespread use has been limited due to the extremely low temperatures required to maintain the superconducting state. Therefore, over the last decade, a lot of researchers have focused on achieving what is known as "high-temperature superconductivity" or superconductivity above liquid nitrogen temperature."</em> <a href="https://www.jaist.ac.jp/english/whatsnew/press/2022/11/17-1.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have created grids of tiny clumps of atoms known as quantum dots and studied what happens when electrons dive into these archipelagos of atomic islands. Measuring the behavior of electrons in these relatively simple setups promises deep insights into how electrons behave in complex real-world materials and could help researchers engineer devices that make possible powerful quantum computers and other innovative technologies. In work published in Nature Communications, the researchers made multiple 3-by-3 grids of precisely spaced quantum dots, each comprising one to three phosphorus atoms. Attached to the grids were electrical leads and other components that enabled electrons to flow through them. The grids provided playing fields in which electrons could behave in nearly ideal, textbook-like conditions, free of the confounding effects of real-world materials. The researchers injected electrons into the grids and observed how they behaved as the researchers varied conditions such as the spacing between the dots."</em> <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/11/nists-grid-quantum-islands-could-reveal-secrets-powerful-technologies">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/radiation-transport-dense-plasmas-modeling-542632/">How does radiation travel through dense plasma?</a></h2>

<p><em>"First-of-its-kind experimental evidence defies conventional theories about how plasmas emit or absorb radiation. Most people are familiar with solids, liquids, and gases as three states of matter. However, a fourth state of matter, called plasmas, is the most abundant form of matter in the universe, found throughout our solar system in the sun and other planetary bodies. Because dense plasma—a hot soup of atoms with free-moving electrons and ions—typically only forms under extreme pressure and temperatures, scientists are still working to comprehend the fundamentals of this state of matter. Understanding how atoms react under extreme pressure conditions—a field known as high-energy-density physics (HEDP)—gives scientists valuable insights into the fields of planetary science, astrophysics, and fusion energy. One important question in the field of HEDP is how plasmas emit or absorb radiation."</em> <a href="https://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/radiation-transport-dense-plasmas-modeling-542632/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"How to regulate a washing machine motor controlling its torque to maintain constant the RPM The motor regulator shown in this article is a regulator for universal motors (brushed) at 220V that allows to control the torque or to keep the rotation speed constant at the fixed value as the load varies. It is designed to work with washing machine motors equipped with a tachometer (or speed) sensor such as the MCA 30/64 motor. The name of this regulator is MST_K07_CL The MST_K07_CL regulator implements the automatic torque control: the current of the motor is adjusted so that the rotation speed remains constant at the set value as the load varies. If the load, applied to the motor, tends to reduce / increase the rpm then the regulator will react by bringing the rpm value back to the set one. This type of regulation is obtained by means of the closed loop control that the regulator implements on the motor. This control is based on the electrical signal from the speed sensor which converts the rotation of the motor shaft into a proportional electrical voltage."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/microst/controlled-torque-washing-machine-motor-regulator-eb8931">[...]</a>

A phase-locked loop (PLL) is an electronic circuit with a voltage or voltage-driven oscillator that constantly adjusts to match the frequency of an input signal. PLLs are used to generate, stabilize, modulate, demodulate, filter or recover a signal from a "noisy" communications channel where data has been interrupted. PLLs are widely used in wireless or radio frequency (RF) applications, including Wi-Fi routers, broadcast radios, walkie-talkie radios, televisions and mobile phones. At its simplest, a phase-locked loop is a closed-loop feedback control circuit that's both frequency- and phase-sensitive.

<p><em>"In this project we will be creating an RC Car from scratch using 3D printed parts! Which will be used in my next project where we will be making the RC Car fully autonomous, that can drive itself, detect signs, obstacles, traffic lights, and much more. I have made avideothat goes over the whole project and explains each step very clearly. So if you want a video version, I highly recommend watching the video as it is much easier to follow. Supplies Here is a list of all the components used in the project, I have also included links to the exact product used to might it slightly easier for you to find the exact components used. - ESP32, this is used as the on-board micro-controller on the car."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/RC-Car-From-SCRATCH/">[...]</a>
