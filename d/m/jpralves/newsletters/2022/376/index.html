<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1793, o matemático inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Green_(mathematician)">George Green</a>. Ele foi o primeiro a desenvolver uma teoria matemática da electricidade e do magnetismo. Surpreendentemente, seguiu o ofício de padeiro e moleiro do seu pai. Não só foi autodidacta como matemático, mas em Mar 1828 publicou em privado algumas dezenas de exemplares de uma obra sofisticada, An Essay on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of Electricity and Magnetism. No início, chamou pouca atenção, mas aos 40 anos de idade foi estudar em Cambridge (Out 1833). Eventualmente o seu Ensaio tornou-se conhecido de Lord Kelvin (William Thomson) que o compreendeu e o construiu, bem como de James Clerk Maxwell. De origens obscuras, Green tinha iniciado as modernas teorias matemáticas da electricidade.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1800, o químico francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Baptiste_Dumas">Jean-Baptiste Dumas</a>. Ele foi um pioneiro na química orgânica. Propugnando novas teorias de relações entre compostos orgânicos, lançou as bases para o trabalho posterior de Kekulé. Em 1823, trabalhando com Jean-Louis Prévost, Dumas mostrou que a ureia é transportada pelo sangue. Juntos em 1824-25, repetiram as experiências de filtração de Lazarro Spallanzani, confirmando assim a necessidade de espermatozóides para fertilização, e descreveram a clivagem num óvulo de rã. Em 1833, com a determinação de nitrogénio em compostos orgânicos, ele estabeleceu análises orgânicas quantitativas. Duas décadas antes de Mendeléev, em 1851, ele procurou estabelecer uma ordem entre os elementos pelas suas propriedades. Em 1848 passou à política, tornando-se Mestre da Casa da Moeda em 1868.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1842, o engenheiro químico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Benjamin_Dudley">Charles Benjamin Dudley</a>. Ele foi um dos primeiros apoiantes da normalização e dos ensaios de materiais na indústria. A partir de 1875, como químico da Companhia Ferroviária da Pensilvânia, pesquisou a metalurgia dos carris de aço porque a sua ruptura era um sério risco nessa altura. Quando descobriu uma enorme variação na qualidade do aço e publicou os seus resultados (1878), os fabricantes não cooperaram no início. Contudo, Dudley insistiu na continuação dos testes, e em normas rigorosas para combustíveis, lubrificantes, tintas, dispositivos de iluminação e várias peças mecânicas de locomotivas e material circulante. Ele co-fundou (1898) a Sociedade Americana de Testes e Materiais, e foi seu presidente desde 1902 até à sua morte.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1857, o industrial norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Louis_Maytag_I">Frederick L. Maytag</a>. Ele, em conjunto com outros três homens em 1893 iniciou um negócio de implementos agrícolas em Newton, Iowa. Fizeram malhadeiras, cortadores de bandas e acessórios de auto-alimentação inventados por um dos fundadores, George Parsons. Em 1902, a empresa era o maior fabricante mundial de alimentadores de máquinas debulhadoras. Contudo, a empresa passou mais tarde para a produção de máquinas de lavar, devido à natureza sazonal da indústria agrícola. A sua primeira máquina de lavar foi a cuba de madeira Parson's Pastime alimentada manualmente (1907-08). Em 1909, a Maytag tomou a seu cargo a sua própria indústria, a Maytag Company para manter o seu controlo de qualidade no planeamento e produção de máquinas de lavar.
Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1918, o engenheiro electrotécnico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Wright_Forrester">Jay W. Forrester</a>. Ele supervisionou a construção do computador Whirlwind no Massachusetts Institute of Technology, para o qual inventou a memória de núcleo magnético de acesso aleatório, o dispositivo de armazenamento de informação utilizado na maioria dos computadores digitais. Estudou também a aplicação de computadores a problemas de gestão, desenvolvendo métodos de simulação informática.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1921, o químico inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Wilkinson">Geoffrey Wilkinson</a>. Ele partilhou (com Ernst Fischer) o Prémio Nobel da Química em 1973 por "pelo seu trabalho pioneiro, realizado independentemente, sobre a química do organometálico, os chamados compostos sanduíche".</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1969, o engenheiro electrotécnico e inventor mexicano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Hern%C3%A1ndez-Rebollar">Jose Hernandez-Rebollar</a>. Ele concebeu a AcceleGlove (2003), um dispositivo semelhante a uma luva que traduz a linguagem gestual em palavras escritas para indivíduos surdos. Obteve o seu mestrado no México, onde esteve envolvido na construção de sistemas de controlo de antenas para o que viria a ser o maior telescópio do mundo. Depois prosseguiu o seu doutoramento, especializado em Sinais e Sistemas, com uma bolsa de estudos Fulbright na Universidade de Georgetown nos Estados Unidos. Lá, em três anos, ele realizou o seu desejo de longa data de criar uma forma de os surdos traduzirem a linguagem gestual em texto e som por meios electrónicos. A AcceleGlove utiliza sensores de acelerómetro para traduzir a linguagem gestual dos movimentos da mão de um utilizador em sinais lidos por um computador micro-controlador no braço do utilizador. Em 2009, o dispositivo tinha a capacidade de traduzir 300 letras do alfabeto e palavras da linguagem gestual americana (ASL) em palavras e sentenças faladas, em inglês ou espanhol.</p>

<p>Em 1850, a primeira demonstração pública de gelo feita por refrigeração nos EUA teve lugar durante um jantar na Mansion House, Apalachicola, o Dr. John Gorrie produziu blocos de gelo do tamanho de tijolos. Ele instalou o seu sistema no Hospital Marinho dos EUA em Apalachicola. Obteve a primeira patente de congelador mecânico em 6 de Maio de 1851, para uma "melhoria no processo de produção artificial de gelo".</p>

<p>Em 1867, Alfred Nobel demonstrou a dinamite pela primeira vez numa pedreira em Redhill, Surrey. Em 1866, Alfred Nobel produziu o que ele acreditava ser uma forma segura e controlável de nitroglicerina chamada dinamite. Ele estabeleceu a sua própria fábrica para a produzir, mas em 1864 uma explosão na fábrica matou o irmão mais novo de Nobel e outros quatro trabalhadores. Profundamente chocado com este acontecimento, trabalhou agora num explosivo mais seguro e em 1875 surgiu a gelignite. Seguiram-se outras invenções, incluindo o balistite, uma forma de poder sem fumo, guta-percha artificial e um aço macio para blindagem.</p>

<p>Em 1868, Alvin J. Fellows of New Haven, Connecticut, receberam a primeira patente dos EUA para uma fita métrica de mola. A fita métrica foi encerrada numa caixa circular com um fecho de mola para segurar a fita em qualquer ponto desejado. (N.º 79.965). Anteriormente, uma máquina para imprimir a fita métrica de costura flexível já tinha sido patenteada a 3 de Setembro de 1847, após quatro anos de pesquisa pelo estilista de moda francês, Lavigne. Além disso, porém, Sheffield, Inglaterra afirma não ser apenas a casa do aço inoxidável, mas também onde a fita métrica de mola foi inventada.</p>

<p>Em 1914, foi concedida ao Dr. Robert Goddard a primeira patente americana para um desenho de foguetão alimentado a combustível líquido, intitulada "Rocket Apparatus" (U.S. No. 1,103,503). Descreveu uma câmara de combustão, com bocal expansor, na qual são bombeados combustíveis líquidos. Aos 31 anos, esta era a sua segunda patente de foguetão. Uma semana antes, a 7 de Julho de 1914, foi emitida a sua primeira patente, também para um "Rocket Apparatus". (U.S. No. 1,102,653) que descreveu o conceito de foguetão de múltiplos estágios. A 16 de Março de 1926, o seu lançamento de teste, o primeiro de sempre de um foguete de combustível líquido, conseguiu impulsionar um projéctil de 3 metros de comprimento até uma altura de 12,5 m. O seu voo de 2,5 segundos cobriu uma distância de 56 m a uma velocidade média de 96 Km/h. O combustível era uma combinação de oxigénio líquido e gasolina.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou o presidente norte-americano Joe Biden divulgou a primeira imagem a cores do Telescópio Espacial James Webb da NASA durante um evento público na Casa Branca, em Washington. Esta primeira imagem mostra as poderosas capacidades da missão Webb, uma parceria com a ESA (Agência Espacial Europeia) e a CSA (Agência Espacial Canadiana). A primeira imagem a cores de Webb revela milhares de galáxias, incluindo os objectos mais fracos alguma vez observados a infravermelhos.</p>

<p><em>"Ericsson (NASDAQ: ERIC), Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. and French aerospace company Thales (Euronext Paris: HO) are planning to take 5G out of this world and across a network of Earth-orbiting satellites. After having each conducted detailed research, which included multiple studies and simulations, the parties plan to enter smartphone-use-case-focused testing and validation of 5G non-terrestrial networks (5G NTN). The result could effectively mean that a future 5G smartphone could use 5G connectivity anywhere on Earth and provide complete global coverage for wideband data services, including places normally only covered by legacy satellite phone systems with limited data connectivity capabilities. The benefits of 5G connectivity via low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites are expected to include coverage in extreme geographies or remote areas across seas, oceans and other locations where terrestrial coverage is absent. Such widespread connectivity would boost 5G smartphone subscriber roaming service capabilities, as well as enabling global connectivity for transportation, energy and health sector 5G use cases. The space-based network could also be used as back-up support to terrestrial networks in the event of major network outages or disasters."</em> <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2022/07/ericsson--qualcomm-and-thales-to-take-5g-into-space">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Kristel Michielsen was into quantum computing before quantum computing was cool. The computational physicist simulated quantum computers as part of her Ph.D. work in the Netherlands in the early 1990s. Today, she manages one of Europe’s largest facilities for quantum computing, the Jülich Unified Infrastructure for Quantum Computing (JUNIQ) . Her mission is to help developers pioneer this new realm with tools like NVIDIA Quantum Optimized Device Architecture (QODA). We can’t go on with today’s classical computers alone because they consume so much energy, and they can’t solve some problems,” said Michielsen, who leads the quantum program at the Jülich Supercomputing Center near Cologne. “But paired with quantum computers that won’t consume as much energy, I believe there may be the potential to solve some of our most complex problems.” Enter the QPU Because quantum processors, or QPUs, harness the properties of quantum mechanics, they’re ideally suited to simulating processes at the atomic level."</em> <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2022/07/12/quantum-qoda-julich/">[...]</a>

These panels, tinted green by the biomass sandwiched within, serve several purposes. They take a stream of carbon dioxide, captured from what would otherwise be an emissions source, and bubble it through water impregnated with selected strains of algae, which absorb the CO2, as well as sunlight, and photosynthesize, increasing their mass and generating fresh oxygen.

<p><em>"New solid-state device represents important step toward quantum networks; holds quantum state for up to 28 microseconds Researchers have developed a practical integrated quantum memory device based on a new fiber-coupled waveguide written into a rare-earth doped crystal. Quantum memory stores a quantum state for later retrieval much like computer memory stores binary information. The fiber-integrated solid-state platform can hold a quantum state up to three orders of magnitude longer than previously demonstrated in integrated memories. Jelena V. Rakonjac from ICFO-Institut de Ciencies Fotoniques in Spain presented the new findings at the Optica’s Quantum 2.0 2022 conference 13 – 16 June 2022.

<p><em>"A new technique could improve the precision of atomic clocks and of quantum sensors for detecting dark matter or gravitational waves. The quantum vibrations in atoms hold a miniature world of information. If scientists can accurately measure these atomic oscillations, and how they evolve over time, they can hone the precision of atomic clocks as well as quantum sensors, which are systems of atoms whose fluctuations can indicate the presence of dark matter, a passing gravitational wave, or even new, unexpected phenomena. A major hurdle in the path toward better quantum measurements is noise from the classical world, which can easily overwhelm subtle atomic vibrations, making any changes to those vibrations devilishly hard to detect. Now, MIT physicists have shown they can significantly amplify quantum changes in atomic vibrations, by putting the particles through two key processes: quantum entanglement and time reversal. Before you start shopping for DeLoreans, no, they haven’t found a way to reverse time itself."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/quantum-time-reversal-physics-0714">[...]</a>

<p><em>"By capturing more details, new approach could make lidar useful for facial recognition Researchers have shown that a quantum-inspired technique can be used to perform lidar imaging with a much higher depth resolution than is possible with conventional approaches. Lidar, which uses laser pulses to acquire 3D information about a scene or object, is usually best suited for imaging large objects such as topographical features or built structures due to its limited depth resolution. “Although lidar can be used to image the overall shape of a person, it typically doesn’t capture finer details such as facial features,” said research team leader Ashley Lyons from the University of Glasgow in the United Kingdom. “By adding extra depth resolution, our approach could capture enough detail to not only see facial features but even someone’s fingerprints.” In the Optica Publishing Group journal Optics Express, Lyons and first author Robbie Murray describe the new technique, which they call imaging two-photon interference lidar. They show that it can distinguish reflective surfaces less than 2 millimeters apart and create high-resolution 3D images with micron-scale resolution. “This work could lead to much higher resolution 3D imaging than is possible now, which could be useful for facial recognition and tracking applications that involve small features,” said Lyons."</em> <a href="https://www.optica.org/en-us/about/newsroom/news_releases/2022/july/researchers_use_quantum-inspired_approach_to_incre/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"With particles that release their payloads at different times, one injection could provide multiple vaccine doses. Most vaccines, from measles to Covid-19, require a series of multiple shots before the recipient is considered fully vaccinated. To make that easier to achieve, MIT researchers have developed microparticles that can be tuned to deliver their payload at different time points, which could be used to create “self-boosting” vaccines. In a new study, the researchers describe how these particles degrade over time, and how they can be tuned to release their contents at different time points. The study also offers insights into how the contents can be protected from losing their stability as they wait to be released. Using these particles, which resemble tiny coffee cups sealed with a lid, researchers could design vaccines that would need to be given just once, and would then “self-boost” at a specified point in the future."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/self-boosting-vaccines-0713">[...]</a>

This technique may be used to fabricate a wide variety of single-crystalline materials, including heat-resistant materials for jet engines and gas turbines. Previous studies have reported that single crystals can be fabricated using electron beam additive manufacturing. However, this technique requires expensive equipment and its operation is also costly due to the need to create a vacuum, limiting its widespread use. Although laser additive manufacturing can be performed using cheaper equipment, previous efforts to fabricate single crystals using this technique had failed. When a raw metal powder material is irradiated with a laser beam, it melts, forming a solid-liquid interface."</em> <a href="https://www.nims.go.jp/eng/news/press/2022/06/202206220.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The re-entry of abandoned stages of rockets left in orbit from space launches have a six to 10 per cent chance of severely injuring or killing a human being in the next decade, according to a new UBC study. Researchers say governments need to take collective action and mandate that rocket stages are guided safely back to Earth after their use, which could increase the cost of a launch, but potentially save lives. “Is it permissible to regard the loss of human life as just a cost of doing business, or is it something that we should seek to protect when we can? And that’s the crucial point here: we can protect against this risk,” says lead author Dr. Michael Byers, professor in UBC’s department of political science. When objects such as satellites are launched into space, they use rockets, parts of which are often left in orbit. If these leftover rocket stages have a low enough orbit, they can re-enter the atmosphere in an uncontrolled way."</em> <a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2022/07/12/space-rocket-junk-deadly/">[...]</a>

These memories have the mission of receiving the quantum information encoded in a photon in the form of qubits, store it and then retrieve it. Quantum memories can be realized in different material systems, for example ensembles of cold atoms or doped crystals. In order to be useful memories, they need to fulfil several requirements, such as the efficiency, duration, and multiplexing of their storage capability, to ensure the quality of the quantum communication that they will support. One other requirement that has become a matter of considerable research is designing quantum memories that can be directly integrated in the fibre-optic network."</em> <a href="https://www.icfo.eu/news/2051/a-boost-in-performances-in-fibre-integrated-quantum-memories/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Highly compressed mid-infrared optical waves in a thin dielectric crystal on monocrystalline gold substrate investigated for the first time using a high-resolution scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscope. KAIST researchers and their collaborators at home and abroad have successfully demonstrated a new platform for guiding the compressed light waves in very thin van der Waals crystals. Their method to guide the mid-infrared light with minimal loss will provide a breakthrough for the practical applications of ultra-thin dielectric crystals in next-generation optoelectronic devices based on strong light-matter interactions at the nanoscale. Phonon-polaritons are collective oscillations of ions in polar dielectrics coupled to electromagnetic waves of light, whose electromagnetic field is much more compressed compared to the light wavelength. Recently, it was demonstrated that the phonon-polaritons in thin van der Waals crystals can be compressed even further when the material is placed on top of a highly conductive metal. In such a configuration, charges in the polaritonic crystal are “reflected” in the metal, and their coupling with light results in a new type of polariton waves called the image phonon-polaritons."</em> <a href="https://news.kaist.ac.kr/newsen/html/news/?mode=V&amp;mng_no=22090">[...]</a>

Quantum computing has enormous potential to provide computing power well beyond the capabilities of today’s supercomputers, which could enable advances in many other fields, including chemistry, materials science, medicine and cybersecurity. In order to make this a reality, it is necessary to produce both stable, long-lived qubits that provide processing power, as well as the communications technology that enables these qubits to link together at scale. Past research has indicated that silicon can produce some of the most stable and long-lived qubits in the industry.

In the short term, it is the best way to promote photovoltaics for applications where space is limited e.g., roofs, facades, vehicles, or even drones.

Whereas electronics is based on the flow of electrons, spintronics is based on the spin of electrons. An electron has a spin degree of freedom, meaning that it not only holds a charge but also acts like a little magnet. In spintronics, a key task is to use an electric field to control electron spin and rotate the north pole of the magnet in any given direction. The spintronic field effect transistor harnesses the so-called Rashba or Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling effect, which suggests that one can control electron spin by electric field. Although the method holds promise for efficient and high-speed computing, certain challenges must be overcome before the technology reaches its true, miniature but powerful, and eco-friendly, potential."</em> <a href="https://news.rpi.edu/content/2022/07/14/rensselaer-researchers-learn-control-electron-spin-room-temperature-make-devices">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This is device for treating diseases with the help of different frequencies. A set of several frequencies is given for each disease Bioresonance is a form of therapy which is based on the claim that each organism has its own resonance frequency (bioresonance), the presence of which indicates the existence of a disease. Pioneers in the development of this theory are Raymond Rife, Hulda Clark and others. According to their studies, subjecting the body to the above frequency from an external generator can cure the disease. This device for treating diseases with the help of different frequencies is also called Rife Machine, according to its inventor. A set of several frequencies is given for each disease, as well as the duration of therapy."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/mircemk/simple-arduino-bioresonance-therapy-device-rife-machine-b3c4c6">[...]</a>

This should be a universal module that can easily replace already used modules. My current projects are building a remote control for car robots and RobotArm. The solution can allow swapping a Bluetooth model without having to change anything in the current software. The module was originally developed to control robots, but without any restrictions it can be used to control any other module. You’ll be able to control the robot using a web server that displays a video streaming of what the robot “sees”."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/Kenan-Paralija/remote-control-and-video-monitoring-with-esp32-for-robot-66332b">[...]</a>

The analyzer offers up to 24 digital channels, pre and post trigger sampling, edge trigger and pattern trigger up to 16 bits. The most basic version is purely a Pico as-is, you only need to short GPIO0 and GPIO1, upload the firmware and you're good to go. Of course this has some limitations as the Pico only supports 3.3v, if you want to use it to diagnose 5v signals I also have designed a fast level shifter board. Additionally to the hardware the logic analyzer also includes a powerful software (Windows only for now) where you can visualize the captured data, export captures, use protocol analyzers, etc."</em> <a href="https://github.com/gusmanb/logicanalyzer">[...]</a>
