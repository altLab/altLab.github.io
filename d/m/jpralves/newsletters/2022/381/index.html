<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1685, o matemático britânico <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brook_Taylor">Brook Taylor</a>. Ele ficou conhecido pela série Taylor, um método para expandir funções em séries infinitas. Em 1708, Taylor produziu uma solução para o problema do centro de oscilação. O seu Methodus incrementorum directa et inversa ("Direct and Indirect Methods of Incrementation", 1715) introduziu o que agora se chama o cálculo das diferenças finitas. Usando isto, foi o primeiro a expressar matematicamente o movimento de uma corda vibratória com base em princípios mecânicos. Methodus também continha o teorema de Taylor, mais tarde reconhecido (1772) por Joseph Lagrange como a base do cálculo diferencial. Artista dotado, Taylor também escreveu sobre princípios básicos de perspectiva (1715), contendo o primeiro tratamento geral do princípio dos pontos de fuga.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1897, o engenheiro ucrano-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bern_Dibner">Bern Dibner</a>. Ele trabalhou como engenheiro durante a electrificação de Cuba. Percebendo a necessidade de melhores métodos de ligação de condutores eléctricos, em 1924, fundou a Burndy Engineering Company. Alguns anos mais tarde, interessou-se pela história da ciência renascentista. Posteriormente, começou a coleccionar livros e tudo o que encontrou que estivesse relacionado com a história da ciência. Esta tornou-se uma segunda carreira como erudito que iria decorrer paralelamente à sua vida como homem de negócios. Escreveu muitos livros e panfletos, sobre tópicos desde o transporte de obeliscos antigos, até às biografias autorizadas de muitos pioneiros científicos, incluindo Alessandro Volta, inventor da bateria eléctrica, e Wilhelm Röntgen, descobridor do raio X.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker e alguns vídeos interessantes. É apresentada a revista Hackspace Magazine nº58 de Setembro.</p>

<p><em>"The processor promises a game-changing computer platform to enable more robust and efficient autonomous capabilities for future lunar and planetary exploration missions. NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California has selected Microchip Technology Inc. of Chandler, Arizona, to develop a High-Performance Spaceflight Computing (HPSC) processor that will provide at least 100 times the computational capacity of current spaceflight computers. This key capability would advance all types of future space missions, from planetary exploration to lunar and Mars surface missions. “This cutting-edge spaceflight processor will have a tremendous impact on our future space missions and even technologies here on Earth,” said Niki Werkheiser, director of technology maturation within the Space Technology Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “This effort will amplify existing spacecraft capabilities and enable new ones and could ultimately be used by virtually every future space mission, all benefiting from more capable flight computing.” Microchip will architect, design, and deliver the HPSC processor over three years, with the goal of employing the processor on future lunar and planetary exploration missions. Microchip’s processor architecture will significantly improve the overall computing efficiency for these missions by enabling computing power to be scalable, based on mission needs."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasa-awards-next-generation-spaceflight-computing-processor-contract">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2022/08/18/covision-visual-inspection-for-manufacturing/">Startup’s Vision AI Software Trains Itself — in One Hour — to Detect Manufacturing Defects in Real Time</a></h2>

<p><em>"Cameras have been deployed in factories for over a decade — so why, Franz Tschimben wondered, hasn’t automated visual inspection yet become the worldwide standard? This question motivated Tschimben and his colleagues to found Covision Quality, an AI-based visual-inspection software startup that uses NVIDIA technology to transform end-of-line defect detection for the manufacturing industry. “The simple answer is that these systems are hard to scale,” said Tschimben, the northern Italy-based company’s CEO. “Material defects, like burrs, holes or scratches, have varying geometric shapes and colors that make identifying them cumbersome. That meant quality-control specialists had to program inspection systems by hand to fine-tune their defect parameters.” Covision’s software allows users to train AI models for visual inspection without needing to code. It quadruples accuracy for defect detection and reduces false-negative rates by up to 90% compared with traditional rule-based methods, according to Tschimben."</em> <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2022/08/18/covision-visual-inspection-for-manufacturing/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/about/news-releases/products/rt-polarfire-class-b">Radiation-Tolerant (RT) PolarFire® FPGA Achieves MIL-STD-883 Class B Qualification, Paving the Way for Power-Saving, High-Speed Processing in Space</a></h2>

<p><em>"This major step toward QML Class Q and Class V spaceflight qualification enables system integration using Microchip’s RT PolarFire® FPGAs, leveraging their power and radiation advantages over SRAM-based FPGA alternatives. Spaceflight system developers often commit to designing with new components only after they have received MIL-STD-883 Class B qualification and are in the process of meeting the Qualified Manufacturers List (QML) Class Q and Class V standards for spaceflight component reliability. Microchip Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP) has now achieved the first qualification milestone with its RT PolarFire® FPGA, enabling designers to begin assembling spaceflight systems that take advantage of this FPGA's superior computing and connectivity throughput and its significantly lower power consumption and immunity to configuration Single Event Upsets (SEUs) compared to SRAM-based FPGAs. “Microchip is a QML-certified manufacturer of high-reliability FPGAs for space applications and has attained the highest available Class V qualification multiple times on FPGAs and other integrated circuits,” said Shakeel Peera, vice president of marketing for Microchip’s FPGA business unit. “This MIL-STD-883 class B qualification is yet another big step toward solving some of spaceflight’s most difficult system challenges, including reducing satellite signal processing congestion with much lower power consumption and greater reliability than is possible using alternative FPGA solutions. We have started the final step of qualifying our RT PolarFire FPGAs to both QML Class Q and Class V requirements.” To achieve MIL-STD-883 Class B qualification, RT PolarFire FPGAs passed a series of environmental tests to determine resistance to the harmful effects of natural elements, the conditions of defense and space operations and mechanical and electrical tests."</em> <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/about/news-releases/products/rt-polarfire-class-b">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Launched in 1977, the twin Voyager probes are NASA’s longest-operating mission and the only spacecraft ever to explore interstellar space. NASA’s twin Voyager probes have become, in some ways, time capsules of their era: They each carry an eight-track tape player for recording data, they have about 3 million times less memory than modern cellphones, and they transmit data about 38,000 times slower than a 5G internet connection. Yet the Voyagers remain on the cutting edge of space exploration. Managed and operated by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, they are the only probes to ever explore interstellar space – the galactic ocean that our Sun and its planets travel through. The Sun and the planets reside in the heliosphere, a protective bubble created by the Sun’s magnetic field and the outward flow of solar wind (charged particles from the Sun). Researchers – some of them younger than the two distant spacecraft – are combining Voyager’s observations with data from newer missions to get a more complete picture of our Sun and how the heliosphere interacts with interstellar space."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/voyager-nasas-longest-lived-mission-logs-45-years-in-space">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The last year or so was already a wild ride for the open source instruction set architecture RISC-V, then Intel stepped in, took a top tier membership, a seat on the board, pledged to spend a billion dollars on the architecture, and began partnering with key RISC-V vendors. RISC-V, the open-source reduced instruction set architecture that’s used for everything from accelerators and microcontrollers to CPUs and GPUs, continues to be on an accelerating roll (no pun intended). When I asked Calista Redmond, CEO of RISC-V International, the nonprofit foundation in charge of the project, to put the current state of RISC-V into a single word, she didn’t hesitate. “Velocity,” she answered. She said that RISC-V’s pace of growth during the last 12 months was already increasing exponentially, when in February the unthinkable happened: the world’s largest chipmaker, Intel, got on board and not only signed up as a top tier premier member (and took a seat on the foundation’s board), it gave weight to its commitment by immediately entering into partnerships with five top RISC-V vendors, and pledged to invest $1 billion in the architecture. Intel and RISC-V Redmond called that “perhaps one of the biggest moments in RISC-V history,” and compared it to IBM’s famous billion dollar investment in Linux in 2001, which quickly led to Linux’s dominance in data centers, at the expense of Windows and proprietary Unixes."</em> <a href="https://fossforce.com/2022/08/open-source-risc-v-is-rolling-towards-the-mainstream/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Children who develop a deeper understanding of numbers at preschool age become better at mathematics than those who learn to count forwards and backwards one step at a time. This is the finding of research carried out at the University of Gothenburg, which has also tested different methods for teaching mathematics. The most common way for children to learn mathematics is by using the number sequence and counting forwards and backwards one step at a time. For example, to add six and two, they start at six and count up on their fingers to seven and then eight. However, this method of counting only works for simple tasks. More advanced calculations require a deeper understanding."</em> <a href="https://www.gu.se/en/news/new-method-develops-mathematical-understanding">[...]</a>

Elemental cosmic building material Before the Earth and the Sun existed, their constituents were part of a vast cloud of gas and dust. A so-​called interstellar molecular cloud that at one point collapsed under its own gravity, thus initiating the process that gave rise to the Solar System. astronomy has come a long way in unravelling the mysteries of the planets and star within our system and many beyond it, surprisingly little is known about the cosmic dust from which they all emerged.

<p><em>"A new theory enables the simulation of complex pattern formation in biological systems across different spatial and temporal scales. For many processes important for life such as cell division, cell migration, and the development of organs, the spatially and temporally correct formation of biological patterns is essential. To understand these processes, the principal task consists not in explaining how patterns form out of a homogeneous initial condition, but in explaining how simple patterns change into increasingly complex ones. Illuminating the mechanisms of this complex self-organization on various spatial and temporal scales is a key challenge for science. So-called “coarse-graining” techniques allow such multiscale systems to be simplified, such that they can be described with a reduced model at large length and time scales. “The price you pay for coarse-graining, however, is that important information about the patterns on small scales – like the pattern type – is lost."</em> <a href="https://www.lmu.de/en/newsroom/news-overview/news/complex-patterns-building-a-bridge-from-the-large-to-the-small.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Resilient robot teams juggle competing priorities without deadlock A robot, or a group of robots, on a mission often have conflicting priorities. The primary mission of a team of search and rescue robots, for example, is to find survivors. But when they do, they also need to be able to send information to the rest of the team. The best way to find survivors may be to spread out, but the best way to send information is to stay close together. If robotic teams are going to be deployed in more real-world situations, they’re going to need a system to balance these priorities. Computer scientists at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) have developed a new control mechanism for robotic teams that allow them to automatically calculate the tradeoffs of maintaining a resilient communication network and achieving their primary goal of moving through an environment."</em> <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2022/08/resilient-robots">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Under most conditions, according to a new proof, algorithms on a quantum annealing computer don't offer quantum speedup Recent research proves that under certain conditions, quantum annealing computers can run algorithms — including the well-known Shor’s algorithm — more quickly than classical computers. In most cases, however, quantum annealing does not provide a speedup compared to classical computing when time is limited, according to a study in Nature Communications. “We proved that you can be sure you will reach a fast solution from the initial problem, but that’s only true for a certain class of problems that can be set up so that the many histories of evolution of the quantum system interfere constructively. Then the different quantum histories enhance each other’s probability to reach the solution,” said Nikolai Sinitsyn, a theoretical quantum physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory and co-author of the paper with his Los Alamos colleague Bin Yan. While examples of superior quantum performance in quantum annealing simulations are routinely reported, they lack definite proof. Sometimes researchers infer that they have achieved quantum advantage, but they cannot prove that this superiority is over any competing classical algorithm, Sinitsyn said."</em> <a href="https://discover.lanl.gov/news/0816-quantum-annealing">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Stanford engineers created a more efficient and flexible AI chip, which could bring the power of AI into tiny edge devices. AI-powered edge computing is already pervasive in our lives. Devices like drones, smart wearables, and industrial IoT sensors are equipped with AI-enabled chips so that computing can occur at the “edge” of the internet, where the data originates. This allows real-time processing and guarantees data privacy. However, AI functionalities on these tiny edge devices are limited by the energy provided by a battery. Therefore, improving energy efficiency is crucial."</em> <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2022/08/18/new-chip-ramps-ai-computing-efficiency/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scientists use old-fashioned art form and 3D printing to make major advance in eliminating exclusion of individuals with blindness or low vision from chemistry and other life sciences Media Contact: Lori Fogleman, Baylor University Media and Public Relations, 254-709-5959 Follow us on Twitter: @BaylorUMedia A research team led by Baylor University chemists has taken a groundbreaking step forward in eliminating the exclusion of individuals with blindness from chemistry education and experiences. In an article published today in Science Advances, the researchers detail how they used lithophane – an old-fashioned art form – and 3D printing to turn scientific data into tactile graphics that glow with video-like resolution, enabling both blind and sighted individuals to universally visualize the same piece of data. Although the lithophane is an ancient artistic medium, it has never been used – until now – to represent scientific data and imagery in a quantitative, controlled manner for tactile visualization and tactile integration. The Baylor study – “Data for all: Tactile graphics that light up with picture-perfect resolution” – compared how blind and sighted people interpreted lithophane data by touch or eyesight. The participant cohorts tested the five lithophane forms – gel electropherograms, micrographs, electronic and mass spectra, and textbook illustrations – interpreting all five lithophanes by tactile sensing or eyesight at 79% overall accuracy, according to the study. The researchers focused on creating and testing lithophanes of data found in the chemical sciences because of the explicit and systematic exclusion of students with blindness from chemistry, which the researchers noted “can be viewed as a virtue by educators, parents, peers or self, on the basis of laboratory safety and the ‘visual’ nature of chemistry.” “This research is an example of art making science more accessible and inclusive."</em> <a href="https://www.baylor.edu/mediacommunications/news.php?action=story&amp;story=229877">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A rechargeable battery’s load should be disconnected at the point of complete discharge, to avoid a further (deep) discharge that can shorten its life or destroy it. Because a battery’s terminal voltage recovers when you disconnect the load, you can’t simply disconnect the load when the terminal voltage dips below the established threshold and then re-connect it when the voltage returns above that threshold. Such action may produce chatter in the disconnect switch. The project shown here is a complete solution to this problem. The circuit disconnects the load when the battery level goes below a set point. The project is built using the MAX882 chip, which has a low-battery comparator and error amplifier that share the internal reference and the external resistor divider."</em> <a href="https://www.electronics-lab.com/project/deep-discharge-protector-for-3-6v-li-ion-battery/">[...]</a>

With this, as long as you have internet access, you can access your robot everywhere. This project has also been a learning for me to know how IoT devices work. A little background here, All this time I want to build something that can be controlled through the internet. It's really fascinating, the idea to control something far away from it. But, in search of building it I cannot seems to find the right source to build it."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Internet-Remote-Controlled-Robot-Car/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.instructables.com/Low-Cost-Orbital-Shaker-With-Variable-Shaking-Freq/">Low-Cost Orbital Shaker With Variable Shaking Frequency and Diameter</a></h2>

<p><em>"An orbital shaker is a type of shaker that generates a horizontal circular motion at different angular speeds. It is widely used for various biological and chemical applications, primarily in medicine to study microbe cultures; however, the cost and entry barrier remain high. We built a low-cost orbital shaker that has the ability to operate at various shaking frequencies and shaking diameters. It is designed to hold a standard 96 well plate, beakers, or other small labware. This system can be applied to many research lab applications, and its ease of use and relatively low-budget compared to manufactured systems makes it accessible to many. This design was adapted from the project at https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2983846 Tools - Computer capable of running Arduino - Arduino Software - Phillips Head Screwdrivers - Pliers - Soldering Equipment - Multimeter - 3D printer (Original Prusa i3 MK3S+ recommended) - Super Glue"</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Low-Cost-Orbital-Shaker-With-Variable-Shaking-Freq/">[...]</a>

An ESP32-CAM module is a low-cost device based on ESP32-S module, an OV2640 image sensor and Micro SD slot. The module is not designed for low energy consumption, however, after some tweaks, the power consumption can be lowered to a level that is usable for short periods of time, powered by solar energy. The project presented here is a reasonably robust, dust-resistant and waterproof experimentation platform, using commercial off-the-shelf components. Ideal for outdoor usage.

After trying to revamp my Robotic Arm I ran into some power supply issues with it so I decided to try and make my own bench top power supply. This will probably be overkill for anything I do but I’ve seen these types of computer power supply conversion online before and thought it would be a cool thing to try. I know the bare minimum when it comes to electronics so most of what I’m doing here was learn through google.
