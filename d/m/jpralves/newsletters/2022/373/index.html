<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1775, o físico francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tienne-Louis_Malus">Étienne-Louis Malus</a>. Ele descobriu que a luz, quando reflectida, se polariza parcialmente plana; ou seja, os seus raios vibram no mesmo plano. Ele serviu no corpo de engenheiros de Napoleão, lutou no Egipto, e contraiu a peste durante a campanha abortada de Napoleão na Palestina. Enviado para a Europa depois de 1801, começou a investigação em óptica. Em 1808, descobriu que os raios de luz podem ser polarizados por reflexão, enquanto olhava através de um cristal de faísca da Islândia para as janelas de um edifício reflectindo os raios do Sol. Reparou que ao rodar o cristal a luz se extinguia em certas posições. Aplicando a teoria corpuscular, argumentou que as partículas de luz têm lados ou pólos e cunhou a palavra "polarização".</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1859, o industrial francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89douard_Michelin_(industrialist)">Édouard Michelin</a>. Ele, com o seu irmão mais velho André, fundou a Michelin Tyre Co. em 1888, expandindo a empresa de borracha fundada (1832) pelo seu avô, Aristide Barbier, e Nicolas Edouard Daubree. Os Michelins fizeram os primeiros pneus que podiam ser facilmente removidos para reparação, para bicicletas (1891) e para automóveis (1895). Introduziram padrões de banda de rodagem de pneus, pneus de balão de baixa pressão, e pneus com cordas de aço. A empresa criou uma organização de guias turísticos que colocou marcos nas estradas francesas e estabeleceu um serviço de mapa de estradas padrão para a maior parte da Europa. André criou guias Michelin para promover o turismo de carro. O primeiro Guia Vermelho, com classificação de restaurantes, foi publicado em 1900.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1902, o desenhador de computadores <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Engstrom">Howard T. Engstrom</a>. Ele promoveu o primeiro computador digital disponível comercialmente, o Univac. Como professor de Yale tinha escrito um trabalho sobre a base matemática para técnicas de cripto-análise. Durante a II Guerra Mundial foi chamado à Marinha e colocado no comando da "Secção de Pesquisa" das máquinas automáticas OP-20-G para a descodificação de mensagens. Depois da guerra, foi co-fundador da Engineering Research Associates, uma empresa privada para trabalhar em tecnologia de circuitos digitais electrónicos para a Marinha com base num contrato, com antigos investigadores da Marinha. A ERA entregou o seu primeiro computador Atlas à Agência Nacional de Segurança em Dezembro de 1950. Como vice-presidente para a investigação, Engstrom tomou a iniciativa de fazer uma versão comercial, rebaptizada Univac.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1912, o matemático inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</a>. Ele foi pioneiro no campo da teoria informática e contribuiu com importantes análises lógicas de processos informáticos. Fez importantes contribuições para a matemática, a cripto-análise, a lógica, a filosofia e a biologia e para as novas áreas mais tarde designadas por informática, ciência cognitiva, inteligência artificial, e vida artificial. Ele é amplamente considerado como o pai da informática teórica e da inteligência artificial. Durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial, Turing trabalhou para o Government Code e Cypher School (GC&amp;CS) em Bletchley Park, o centro britânico de quebra de cifras que produziu Ultra intelligence. Durante algum tempo liderou a Hut 8, a secção responsável pela cripto-análise naval alemã. Aqui, concebeu uma série de técnicas para acelerar a quebra de cifras alemãs, incluindo melhorias no método da bomba polaca antes da guerra, uma máquina electromecânica que podia encontrar cenários para a máquina Enigma. Turing desempenhou um papel crucial na quebra de mensagens codificadas interceptadas que permitiram aos Aliados derrotar as potências do Eixo em muitos compromissos cruciais, incluindo a Batalha do Atlântico.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1943, o cientista da computação norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vint_Cerf">Vint Cerf</a>. Ele é considerado um dos pais da Internet. Ele co-desenhou a arquitectura do funcionamento da Internet com os protocolos TCP/IP. Cerf foi também pioneiro no estabelecimento do primeiro serviço comercial de correio electrónico, enquanto vice-presidente da MCI Digital Information Services (1982-1986). Juntou-se à Google como vice-presidente em 2005.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que as sondas Voyager lançadas em 1977 estão a morrer. Após quase 45 anos no espaço, ainda estão a funcionar, enviando diariamente dados para a Terra a partir dos planetas mais distantes conhecidos do sistema solar. Viajaram mais longe e duraram mais tempo do que qualquer outra nave espacial na história. E atravessaram para o espaço interestelar, de acordo com a nossa melhor compreensão da fronteira entre a esfera de influência do Sol e o resto da galáxia. São os primeiros objectos feitos pelo homem a fazê-lo, uma distinção que manterão pelo menos por mais algumas décadas. Estas sondas viajaram por todos os planetas exteriores (com excepção de Plutão) e alteraram para sempre a nossa compreensão do sistema solar e da sua origem. De lembrar que a bordo destas sondas, a NASA colocou uma mensagem, uma espécie de cápsula do tempo, destinada a comunicar uma história do nosso mundo aos extraterrestres. A mensagem da Voyager é levada por um disco fonógrafo, um disco de cobre dourado de 12 polegadas contendo sons e imagens seleccionados para retratar a diversidade da vida e da cultura na Terra.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker e alguns vídeos interessantes. É apresentada a revista Hackspace nº56 de Julho.</p>

<p><em>"The pioneering probes are still running after nearly 45 years in space, but they will soon lose some of their instruments. If the stars hadn't aligned, two of the most remarkable spacecraft ever launched never would have gotten off the ground. In this case, the stars were actually planets—the four largest in the solar system. Some 60 years ago they were slowly wheeling into an array that had last occurred during the presidency of Thomas Jefferson in the early years of the 19th century. For a while the rare planetary set piece unfolded largely unnoticed. The first person to call attention to it was an aeronautics doctoral student at the California Institute of Technology named Gary Flandro."</em> <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/record-breaking-voyager-spacecraft-begin-to-power-down/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Striking rock formations documented by the rover provide evidence of a drying climate in the Red Planet’s ancient past. For the past year, NASA’s Curiosity Mars rover has been traveling through a transition zone from a clay-rich region to one filled with a salty mineral called sulfate. While the science team targeted the clay-rich region and the sulfate-laden one for evidence each can offer about Mars’ watery past, the transition zone is proving to be scientifically fascinating as well. In fact, this transition may provide the record of a major shift in Mars’ climate billions of years ago that scientists are just beginning to understand. The clay minerals formed when lakes and streams once rippled across Gale Crater, depositing sediment at what is now the base of Mount Sharp, the 3-mile-tall (5-kilometer-tall) mountain whose foothills Curiosity has been ascending since 2014. Higher on the mountain in the transition zone, Curiosity’s observations show that the streams dried into trickles and sand dunes formed above the lake sediments."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-curiosity-captures-stunning-views-of-a-changing-mars-landscape">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Cutting both on-resistance and switching loss, while optimizing body-diode properties, the STMicroelectronics 40V MOSFETs, STL320N4LF8 and STL325N4LF8AG, save energy and ensure low noise in circuits for power conversion, motor control, and power distribution. The new 40V N-channel enhancement-mode MOSFETs leverage the latest-generation STPOWER STripFET F8 oxide-filled trench technology to achieve superior figures of merit. The STL320N4LF8 and STL325N4LF8AG feature maximum on-resistance (Rds(on)) of 0.8mOhm and 0.75mOhm, respectively, at gate-source voltage (VGS) of 10V. The MOSFETs extremely efficient Rds(on) per die area allows a space-saving and thermally efficient PowerFLAT 5×6 package. ST’s advanced STripFET F8 technology also ensures excellent switching speed through low device capacitances that minimize dynamic parameters such as gate-drain charge, boosting the system efficiency. Designers can select switching frequency in the range from 600kHz to 1MHz, permitting smaller capacitive and magnetic components to save circuit size and bill of materials, as well as increasing the power density of the final application."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4456.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The mission’s team has chosen to operate its seismometer longer than previously planned, although the lander will run out of power sooner as a result. As the power available to NASA’s InSight Mars lander diminishes by the day, the spacecraft’s team has revised the mission’s timeline in order to maximize the science they can conduct. The lander was projected to automatically shut down the seismometer – InSight’s last operational science instrument – by the end of June in order to conserve energy, surviving on what power its dust-laden solar panels can generate until around December. Instead, the team now plans to program the lander so that the seismometer can operate longer, perhaps until the end of August or into early September. Doing so will discharge the lander’s batteries sooner and cause the spacecraft to run out of power at that time as well, but it might enable the seismometer to detect additional marsquakes. “InSight hasn’t finished teaching us about Mars yet,” said Lori Glaze, director of NASA’s Planetary Science Division in Washington."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-insight-gets-a-few-extra-weeks-of-mars-science">[...]</a>

PCI-SIG technical workgroups will be developing the PCIe 7.0 specification with the following feature goals: - Delivering 128 GT/s raw bit rate and up to 512 GB/s bi-directionally via x16 configuration - Utilizing PAM4 (Pulse Amplitude Modulation with 4 levels) signaling - Focusing on the channel parameters and reach - Continuing to deliver the low-latency and high-reliability targets - Improving power efficiency - Maintaining backwards compatibility with all previous generations of PCIe technology “For 30 years the guiding principle of PCI-SIG has been, ‘If we build it, they will come,’” observed Nathan Brookwood, Research Fellow at Insight 64. “Early parallel versions of PCI technology accommodated speeds of hundreds of megabytes/second, well matched to the graphics, storage and networking demands of the 1990s. In 2003, PCI-SIG evolved to a serial design that supported speeds of gigabytes/second to accommodate faster solid-state disks and 100MbE Ethernet. Almost like clockwork, PCI-SIG has doubled PCIe specification bandwidth every three years to meet the challenges of emerging applications and markets. Today’s announcement of PCI-SIG’s plan to double the channel’s speed to 512 GB/s (bi-directionally) puts it on track to double PCIe specification performance for another 3-year cycle.” “With the forthcoming PCIe 7.0 specification, PCI-SIG continues our 30-year commitment to delivering industry-leading specifications that push the boundaries of innovation,” said Al Yanes, PCI-SIG President and Chairperson."</em> <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220621005137/en">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scientists are developing artificial photosynthesis to help make food production more energy-efficient here on Earth, and one day possibly on Mars Photosynthesis has evolved in plants for millions of years to turn water, carbon dioxide, and the energy from sunlight into plant biomass and the foods we eat. This process, however, is very inefficient, with only about 1% of the energy found in sunlight ending up in the plant. Scientists at UC Riverside and the University of Delaware have found a way to bypass the need for biological photosynthesis altogether and create food independent of sunlight by using artificial photosynthesis. The research, published in Nature Food, uses a two-step electrocatalytic process to convert carbon dioxide, electricity, and water into acetate, the form of the main component of vinegar. Food-producing organisms then consume acetate in the dark to grow. Combined with solar panels to generate the electricity to power the electrocatalysis, this hybrid organic-inorganic system could increase the conversion efficiency of sunlight into food, up to 18 times more efficient for some foods."</em> <a href="https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2022/06/23/artificial-photosynthesis-can-produce-food-without-sunshine">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk/news/new-lithium-co2-batteries-are-being-manufactured-surrey-potential-revolutionise-energy-storage">New lithium-CO2 batteries are being manufactured at Surrey, with potential to revolutionise energy storage</a></h2>

<p><em>"Lithium-based batteries capable of capturing carbon dioxide to help store energy are being designed and manufactured by the University of Surrey, thanks to support from the Faraday Institute. These lithium-CO2 batteries have a theoretical energy density of 1800 Wh/kg, which is substantially higher than that of lithium-ion battery systems on the market today – meaning lighter batteries or more capacity for the same weight, with potential benefits across industrial applications. Dr Yunlong Zhao, project lead from the University of Surrey, said: "We are incredibly excited about lithium-CO2 battery technology, which has the potential to revolutionise the energy storage industry and move us ever closer to reaching net-zero emissions. With the help of our bespoke fabrication platform, we can design and manufacture practical lithium–CO2 pouch cells that eliminate the problems these batteries have faced in the past." Current designs of lithium-CO2 batteries suffer from major inefficiencies caused by electrolyte leakage and evaporation. The team from Surrey is proposing to design and produce lithium-CO2 batteries with valve-regulated sealed 'pouch' cells to solve these problems."</em> <a href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk/news/new-lithium-co2-batteries-are-being-manufactured-surrey-potential-revolutionise-energy-storage">[...]</a>

The silicon-based computer chips that power our modern devices require vast amounts of energy to operate.

Researchers in the microelectronics and materials sciences communities are seeking ways to sustainably manage the global need for computing power. The holy grail for reducing this digital demand is to develop microelectronics that operate at much lower voltages, which would require less energy and is a primary goal of efforts to move beyond today’s state-of-the-art CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) devices. Non-silicon materials with enticing properties for memory and logic devices exist; but their common bulk form still requires large voltages to manipulate, making them incompatible with modern electronics."</em> <a href="https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2022/06/22/new-ultrathin-capacitor-could-enable-energy-efficient-microchips/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"An international team of researchers has demonstrated a technique that allows them to align gold nanorods using magnetic fields, while preserving the underlying optical properties of the gold nanorods. “Gold nanorods are of interest because they can absorb and scatter specific wavelengths of light, making them attractive for use in applications such as biomedical imaging, sensors, and other technologies,” says Joe Tracy, corresponding author of a paper on the work and a professor of materials science and engineering at North Carolina State University. It is possible to tune the wavelengths of light absorbed and scattered by engineering the dimensions of the gold nanorods. Magnetically controlling their orientation makes it possible to further control and modulate which wavelengths the nanorods respond to. “In other words, if you can control the alignment of gold nanorods, you have greater control over their optical properties,” Tracy says. “And using magnetic fields to control that alignment means that you can control the alignment without actually touching the nanorods.” In their technique, the researchers synthesize separate solutions of gold nanorods and iron oxide nanoparticles."</em> <a href="https://news.ncsu.edu/2022/06/technique-allows-researchers-to-align-gold-nanorods-with-magnetic-fields/">[...]</a>

A novel technique to obtain such an “in depth” and time-resolved view on the magnetization has now been demonstrated at the Max Born Institute in Berlin, employing broadband femtosecond soft X-ray pulses to study the transient evolution of magnetization depth profiles within a magnetic thin film system. In current information technology, functional magnetic devices typically consist of stacks of thin layers of magnetic and nonmagnetic materials, each only about one nanometer thick. The stacking, choice of atomic species, and the resulting interfaces between the layers are key to the particular function, for example as realized in the giant magnetoresistance read heads in all magnetic hard drives. Over the last years, it was shown that ultrashort laser pulses down to the femtosecond range (1 femtosecond = 10-15 s) can effectively and very fast manipulate the magnetization in a material, allowing a transient change or even permanent reversal of the magnetization state. While these effects have been predominantly studied in simple model systems, future applications will require an understanding of magnetization dynamics in more complex structures with nanometer-scale heterogeneity."</em> <a href="https://mbi-berlin.de/research/highlights/details/following-ultrafast-magnetization-dynamics-in-depth">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Print a prosthesis on your 3D printer and use a myoelectric sensor to control it. The driving idea of ​​this project is to study different methods of controlling a robotic prosthesis of a human upper limb. Since this prosthesis aims to improve the quality of life of people with upper limb amputations, helping to perform routine tasks considered simple for non-amputees. It is hoped that this study will help in the dissemination of the technologies that will be studied and that in the future it will open doors for the improvement or discovery of new technologies. Robotic prosthetics, to many people, may still seem like something out of science fiction movies, a technology still unattainable. However, there are already prostheses on the market, especially those for upper limbs, of the most diverse types and purposes."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/luiz_coppini/myoelectric-sensor-controlled-hand-prosthesis-ecb596">[...]</a>
