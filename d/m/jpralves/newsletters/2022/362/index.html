<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1866, o matemático sueco <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Ivar_Fredholm">Ivar Fredholm</a>. Ele ficou conhecido pelas equações integrais de Fredholm com aplicações em física matemática e ciência actuarial. O seu primeiro trabalho (1890) foi sobre uma classe especial de funções inspirada pela equação de calor. A sua dissertação de doutoramento de 1898 envolveu um estudo de equações diferenciais parciais motivadas por um problema de equilíbrio na elasticidade. Fredhlom também teve uma carreira na ciência actuarial e a partir de 1902 estudou várias questões nesta área, incluindo uma fórmula elegante que propôs para determinar o valor de rendição de uma apólice de seguro de vida. Construiu uma máquina para resolver equações diferenciais. David Hilbert estendeu uma das equações integrais de Fredholm, descobrindo espaços de Hilbert sobre os quais seria construída a teoria quântica.</p>

<p>A 7 de Abril de 1795, o grama, em que se baseia o quilograma, foi decretado para ser igual ao "peso absoluto de um volume de água pura igual a um cubo de um centésimo de metro, e à temperatura do gelo fundente". Embora a definição do quilograma especificasse água a 0 °C - um ponto de temperatura altamente estável - foi substituída pela temperatura a que a água atinge a densidade máxima. Esta temperatura, cerca de 4 °C, não era conhecida com precisão, mas uma das vantagens da nova definição era que o valor Celsius preciso da temperatura não era realmente importante. A conclusão final foi que um decímetro cúbico de água à sua densidade máxima era igual a 99,92072% da massa do quilograma provisório.</p>

<p>Em 1927, a primeira exibição pública de uma transmissão televisiva de longa distância foi vista por um grupo de repórteres e dignitários de jornais no auditório da AT&amp;T Bell Telephone Laboratories, Nova Iorque. A pesquisa na AT&amp;T foi liderada por Herbert Ives, que introduziu o sistema à audiência, seguido de um discurso transmitido pelo então Secretário do Comércio, Herbert Hoover de Washington, D.C. Tanto a imagem ao vivo como a voz foram transmitidas por fio, através de linhas telefónicas. Hoover disse: "Hoje temos, de certa forma, a transmissão da visão pela primeira vez na história do mundo", e também, "O génio humano destruiu agora o impedimento da distância num novo respeito, e de uma forma até agora desconhecida". A realização foi anunciada com grande aclamação pela imprensa.</p>

<p>Em 1964, a IBM lançou o System/360, uma família de seis computadores compatíveis entre si e 40 periféricos que poderiam funcionar em conjunto. Muitos consideram-no o maior jogo de negócios de todos os tempos, mas o System/360 ajudou a transformar o governo, a ciência e a paisagem comercial. Introduziu uma série de padrões industriais no mercado, incluindo o padrão mundial de facto do byte de 8 bits. O investimento de 5 mil milhões de dólares da IBM compensou, e dentro de dois anos as encomendas para o System/360 atingiram 1.000 por mês. Os clientes podiam escolher entre pequeno e grande, baixo a alto desempenho, (quase) todos com o mesmo conjunto de comandos, permitindo aos clientes começar com uma versão de baixo custo da família, e actualizar mais tarde.</p>

<p>Em 2001, a NASA lançou a nave espacial Mars Odyssey 2001 sobre um foguetão Delta II. Imagens impressionantes foram enviadas de volta pelas câmaras de televisão do foguetão durante a sua ascensão em chamas. Odyssey viajaria 286 milhões de milhas antes de entrar em órbita em torno do planeta vermelho em 24 de Outubro de 2001. A sua principal missão era procurar água sob a forma de gelo sob a superfície marciana e criar um mapa térmico do planeta. A partir de uma altitude de cerca de 250 milhas, a nave espacial deveria procurar vestígios de hidrogénio, o que poderia indicar a existência de água.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/04/07/ec_right_to_repair/">European Right to Repair resolution headed for vote</a></h2>

<p><em>"European lawmakers are voting in plenary on a Right to Repair resolution today amid calls for the initiative to go even further. The draft motion for resolution [PDF] cited a survey that found 79 percent of EU citizens thought that manufacturers should make repairs easier, with 77 percent saying a repair would be preferable to replacement, and called for access to parts, repair information, and standardization among devices. To that end, the motion emphasizes labels to indicate repairability and expected lifetime for products, access to parts and repair facilities, an extension to liability for defective goods beyond two years, and calls on the European Commission to "always take into account the highest possible level of consumer protection and consumer welfare." The European Commission is no stranger to the "Right to Repair" movement, having kicked off reforms in 2020 aimed at getting manufacturers to improve their designs with a view to improving longevity and recycling. Apple was required to publish repairability scores for its products in France last year following the introduction of regulations requiring a repairability index on washing machines, smartphones, laptops, televisions, and electric lawnmowers. The motion being voted on today appears to be a step right direction."</em> <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/04/07/ec_right_to_repair/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"To avoid patches of knife-edged rocks, the mission has taken an alternative path up Mount Sharp. NASA’s Curiosity Mars rover spent most of March climbing the “Greenheugh Pediment” – a gentle slope capped by rubbly sandstone. The rover briefly summited this feature’s north face two years ago; now on the pediment’s southern side, Curiosity has navigated back onto the pediment to explore it more fully. But on March 18, the mission team saw an unexpected terrain change ahead and realized they would have to turn around: The path before Curiosity was carpeted with more wind-sharpened rocks, or ventifacts, than they have ever seen in the rover’s nearly 10 years on the Red Planet. Ventifacts chewed up Curiosity’s wheels earlier in the mission. Since then, rover engineers have found ways to slow wheel wear, including a traction control algorithm, to reduce how frequently they need to assess the wheels."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-curiosity-mars-rover-reroutes-away-from-gator-back-rocks">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-bullseye-update-april-2022/">An update to Raspberry Pi OS Bullseye</a></h2>

<p><em>"One of the things which we spend a lot of time thinking about here at Raspberry Pi is security. Cyber-attacks and hacking are, sadly, constantly on the increase, and Raspberry Pi computers are as much a target as any other, just because there are so many of them out there nowadays! Over the years, we have gradually ramped up the security of Raspberry Pi OS; not in response to particular threats, but more as a general precaution.

<p><em>"Additive manufacturing (AM), also known as metal 3D printing, creates objects by addition of material, layer by layer. A major source material for AM is metal powder, which is predominantly produced using a technique called atomisation, in which a molten metal stream is broken up into fine droplets using air or water jets. However, despite its widespread use, atomisation returns poor yield, is expensive, and is inflexible in the types of materials it can handle. A team of researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) led by Koushik Viswanathan, Assistant Professor at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, has identified an alternative technique to produce metal powders that side-steps these problems. This has interesting implications for AM processes in general, including areas such as the manufacture of biomedical implants. In the metal grinding industry, the material removed – called swarf – is often discarded as a waste product."</em> <a href="https://iisc.ac.in/events/an-alternative-low-cost-technique-to-produce-metal-powders-for-3d-printing/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Physicists are closing in on the true nature of the neutrino — and might be closer to answering a fundamental question about our own existence In a Laboratory under a mountain, physicists are using crystals far colder than frozen air to study ghostly particles, hoping to learn secrets from the beginning of the universe. Researchers at the Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events (CUORE) announced this week that they had placed some of the most stringent limits yet on the strange possibility that the neutrino is its own antiparticle. Neutrinos are deeply unusual particles, so ethereal and so ubiquitous that they regularly pass through our bodies without us noticing. CUORE has spent the last three years patiently waiting to see evidence of a distinctive nuclear decay process, only possible if neutrinos and antineutrinos are the same particle. CUORE’s new data shows that this decay doesn’t happen for trillions of trillions of years, if it happens at all.

<p><em>"Interactions between alternating layers of exotic, 2D material create 'entropy-driven order' in a structured system of magnets at equilibrium Extremely small arrays of magnets with strange and unusual properties can order themselves by increasing entropy, or the tendency of physical systems to disorder, a behavior that appears to contradict standard thermodynamics — but doesn’t. “Paradoxically, the system orders because it wants to be more disordered,” said Cristiano Nisoli, a physicist at Los Alamos and coauthor of a paper about the research in Nature Physics. “Our research demonstrates entropy-driven order in a structured system of magnets at equilibrium.” The system examined in this work, known as tetris spin ice, was studied as part of a long-standing collaboration between Nisoli and Peter Schiffer at Yale University, with theoretical analysis and simulations led at Los Alamos and experimental work led at Yale. The research team includes scientists from a number of universities and academic institutions. Nanomagnet arrays, like tetris spin ice, show promise as circuits of logic gates in neuromorphic computing, a leading-edge computing architecture that closely mimics how the brain works. They also have possible applications in a number of high-frequency devices using “magnonics” that exploit the dynamics of magnetism on the nanoscale."</em> <a href="https://discover.lanl.gov/news/0407-nanomagnets">[...]</a>

Work on clean fuel technology tends to focus on green hydrogen, but this ultralight gas poses significant storage and transportation challenges for its use as a fuel for vehicles.

While tools exist to help experts make sense of a model’s reasoning, often these methods only provide insights on one decision at a time, and each must be manually evaluated. Models are commonly trained using millions of data inputs, making it almost impossible for a human to evaluate enough decisions to identify patterns.

The furthest of its kind, the megamaser was detected by South Africa's "MeerKAT," a radio telescope consisting of 64 antennas. Megamasers produced by hydroxyl (OH) molecules are considered reliable tracers of gas-rich galaxy mergers, which are locations of intense star formation. An astronomical maser occurs when some components within a galaxy (like gas clouds) have the right physical conditions and the right alignment to radiate intense energy (in this case, microwaves). When two galaxies collide, their gas can become extremely dense, leading to the formation of large numbers of hydroxyl (OH) molecules made up of one oxygen atom and one hydrogen atom. These OH molecules can then produce a bright signal called a maser, which is similar to a laser but that emits radio waves rather than visible light."</em> <a href="https://www.rutgers.edu/news/researchers-discover-megamaser-five-billion-light-years-earth">[...]</a>

It’s dedicated a specific area to identifying them, and the neurons there are so good at their job that most of us can readily recognize thousands of individuals. With artificial intelligence, computers can now recognize faces with a similar efficiency — and neuroscientists at MIT’s McGovern Institute for Brain Research have found that a computational network trained to identify faces and other objects discovers a surprisingly brain-like strategy to sort them all out. The finding, reported March 16 in Science Advances, suggests that the millions of years of evolution that have shaped circuits in the human brain have optimized our system for facial recognition. “The human brain’s solution is to segregate the processing of faces from the processing of objects,” explains Katharina Dobs, who led the study as a postdoc in the lab of McGovern investigator Nancy Kanwisher, the Walter A.

<p><em>"Via MKR GSM 1400, collate water quality data from resources over GPRS to train a Neuton model, run the model, and transmit results via SMS. In this project, I focused on developing an AI-driven budget-friendly device to collect water quality data from various water resources in the field and forecast water pollution levels based on oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), and turbidity measurements. Why is water pollution a global issue? Since we incessantly pollute our limited water resources, which are already drowning in chemicals, waste, plastic, and other contaminants, it is crucial to eschew water pollution before it is too late for relieving the plight of people lacking safe drinking water. Although there are international efforts and campaigns to plummet water contaminants, it is yet a pressing issue to track water pollution levels locally to get prescient warnings regarding possible health and environmental risks. In addition to threatening terrestrial animals, plants, and marine life, water pollution is jeopardizing our health."</em> <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/184621-gsm-sms-enabled-water-pollution-monitor">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Working from home – either you enjoy it, or doing so has been thrust upon you. As a world-class introvert I’ve always enjoyed being self-employed and working from my own office. However others do not, as they have missed out on the activity and interacting with other people in their workplace. I was recently asked by an associate to make up a simple messaging system, that would allow them to indicate their work status and also request a coffee or whatnot from their husband, which has resulted in the simple messaging system described in this article – which you can build too. Being somewhat lazy/efficient I needed a simple WiFi-based solution that allowed for simple control of some digital output pins from a web page. A bit of research resulted with the Particle Photon, a compact WiFi-enabled microcontroller that includes all the Internet-connectivity without any hard work or recurring payments."</em> <a href="https://tronixstuff.com/2022/04/03/build-a-simple-wfh-messaging-system/">[...]</a>
