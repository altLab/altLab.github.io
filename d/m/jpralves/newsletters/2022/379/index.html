<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1755, o inventor francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas-Jacques_Cont%C3%A9">Nicolas-Jacques Conté</a>. Ele concebeu um método de fabrico de lápis de grafite, misturando uma grafite finamente pulverizada com partículas de argila finamente moídas, cozida, e utilizada envolta em madeira. A sua inovação foi desencadeada quando os fornecimentos de plumbago importados foram perturbados pela guerra. Foi o primeiro a utilizar grafite - e esta ainda hoje é utilizada como base para fabricar pontas de lápis. A utilização de diferentes proporções de argila para grafite varia a dureza da ponta do lápis. Foi encomendado por Napoleão como chefe do corpo de balões no Egipto, onde inventou formas de improvisar ferramentas e máquinas necessárias para fornecer pão, tecido, munições, instrumentos cirúrgicos e ferramentas dos engenheiros. Quando jovem, trabalhou como pintor de retratos.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1805, o matemático irlandês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton">William Rowan Hamilton</a>. Aos 12 anos de idade, Hamilton já tinha aprendido catorze línguas quando conheceu o americano, Zerah Colburn, que conseguia realizar façanhas mentais aritméticas espantosas, e eles juntaram-se em concursos. Parece que perder para Colburn despertou o interesse de Hamilton pela matemática. Aos 15 anos, ele começou a estudar as obras de LaPlace e Newton, pelo que aos 17 se tinha tornado o maior matemático vivo. Ele contribuiu para o desenvolvimento da óptica, da dinâmica e da álgebra. A sua invenção do cálculo de quaterniões permitiu uma álgebra ou geometria tridimensional que forneceu uma base para o desenvolvimento posterior da mecânica quântica.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1834, o matemático e lógico inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Venn">John Venn</a>. Ele ficou conhecido por introduzir diagramas Venn, que são usados em lógica, teoria de conjuntos, probabilidade, estatística, e informática. Em 1866, Venn publicou The Logic of Chance, um livro pioneiro que defendia a teoria da frequência da probabilidade, argumentando que a probabilidade deveria ser determinada pela frequência com que algo é previsto, em oposição a suposições "educadas". Venn desenvolveu então as teorias de George Boole na obra Symbolic Logic de 1881, onde destacou o que ficaria conhecido como diagramas de Venn.</p>

<p>Em 1921, um fac-símile foi transmitido por rádio através do Oceano Atlântico utilizando o Belinógrafo inventado por Eduard Belin. Uma mensagem escrita do director do New York Times foi digitalizada pelo equipamento e enviada por rádio de Annapolis, Md., no espaço de sete minutos para os laboratórios de Belin em La Malmaison, França. A imagem recebida demonstrou que depois disso as fotografias podiam ser digitalizadas para transmissão via rádio da mesma forma. O método já estava a ser utilizado na Europa, enviando fotografias por fio. O original, envolto num cilindro rotativo, era digitalizado por um feixe de luz reflectido numa célula fotográfica para converter as variações na intensidade recebida em sinais eléctricos enviados por fios de rádio ou telefone.</p>

<p>Em 1954, o primeiro avião de combate supersónico britânico, o P-1 English Electric Lightning, fez o seu voo inaugural.</p>

<p><em>"The space telescope’s powerful infrared gaze provides a new view of how the galaxy has changed over billions of years. NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has peered into the chaos of the Cartwheel Galaxy, revealing new details about star formation and the galaxy’s central black hole. Webb’s powerful infrared gaze produced this detailed image of the Cartwheel and two smaller companion galaxies against a backdrop of many other galaxies. This image provides a new view of how the Cartwheel Galaxy has changed over billions of years. The Cartwheel Galaxy, located about 500 million light-years away in the Sculptor constellation, is a rare sight. Its appearance, much like that of the wheel of a wagon, is the result of an intense event – a high-speed collision between a large spiral galaxy and a smaller galaxy not visible in this image."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/webb-captures-stellar-gymnastics-in-the-cartwheel-galaxy">[...]</a>

They call the material a super-semiconductor, a term based on two well-known words in electronics: superconductors and semiconductors. Superconductors are materials known since the early 1900s to conduct electricity with zero resistance at ultra-low temperatures, considered to range from -450 to -123 degrees Fahrenheit. Semiconductors are materials that exhibit both conductive and insulating properties, depending on temperature. Made from cobalt and aluminum, the super-semiconductor material is 3 to 10 times more conductive than typical semiconductor materials, such as silicon, at room temperature. It exhibits ultra-low resistivity, too, meaning it allows current to flow through the material with little resistance to slow the electricity down."</em> <a href="https://www.udel.edu/udaily/2022/july/super-semiconductors-for-ultra-low-power-electronics-bingqing-wei/">[...]</a>

This biofilm, which was announced in Nature Communications, has the potential to revolutionize the world of wearable electronics, powering everything from personal medical sensors to personal electronics. “This is a very exciting technology,” says Xiaomeng Liu, graduate student in electrical and computer engineering in UMass Amherst’s College of Engineering and the paper’s lead author. “It is real green energy, and unlike other so-called ‘green-energy’ sources, its production is totally green.” That’s because this biofilm—a thin sheet of bacterial cells about the thickness of a sheet of paper—is produced naturally by an engineered version of the bacteria Geobacter sulfurreducens. G. sulfurreducens is known to produce electricity and has been used previously in “microbial batteries” to power electrical devices. But such batteries require that G. sulfurreducens is properly cared for and fed a constant diet."</em> <a href="https://www.umass.edu/news/article/bacteria-powering-truly-green-revolution-personal-electronics">[...]</a>

<p><em>"When manufacturing techniques turn metals, ceramics or composites into a technologically useful form, understanding the mechanism of the phase transformation process is essential to shape the behavior of those high-performance materials. Seeing those transformations in real time is difficult, however. A new study in the journal Nature, led by Professor Guangwen Zhou from the Thomas J. Watson College of Engineering and Applied Science’s Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Materials Science program at Binghamton University, uses transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to peer into the oxide-to-metal transformation at the atomic level. Of particular interest are the mismatch dislocations that are ever-present at the interfaces in multiphase materials and play a key role in dictating structural and functional properties. Zhou’s students Xianhu Sun and Dongxiang Wu are the first co-authors of the paper (“Dislocation-induced stop-and-go kinetics of interfacial transformations”). Sun recently finished his PhD thesis, and Wu is a PhD candidate."</em> <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=220755">[...]</a>

<p><em>"As demand for solar energy rises around the world, scientists are working to improve the performance of solar devices — important if the technology is to compete with traditional fuels. But researchers face theoretical limits on how efficient they can make solar cells. One method for pushing efficiency beyond those limits involves adding up-conversion nanoparticles to the materials used in the solar devices. Up-conversion materials allow solar cells to harvest energy from a wider spectrum of light than normally possible. A team of scientists testing this approach found the nanoparticles boosted efficiency, but not for the reason they expected. Their research may suggest a new path forward for developing more efficient solar devices."</em> <a href="https://www.psu.edu/news/earth-and-mineral-sciences/story/nanoparticles-increase-light-scattering-boost-solar-cell/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and the Georgia Institute of Technology has 3D printed a dual-phase, nanostructured high-entropy alloy that exceeds the strength and ductility of other state-of-the-art additively manufactured materials, which could lead to higher-performance components for applications in aerospace, medicine, energy and transportation. The work, led by Wen Chen, assistant professor of mechanical and industrial engineering at UMass, and Ting Zhu, professor of mechanical engineering at Georgia Tech, is published online by the journal Nature. Over the past 15 years, high entropy alloys (HEAs) have become increasingly popular as a new paradigm in materials science. Comprised of five or more elements in near-equal proportions, they offer the ability to create a near-infinite number of unique combinations for alloy design. Traditional alloys, such as brass, carbon steel, stainless steel and bronze, contain a primary element combined with one or more trace elements. Additive manufacturing, also called 3D printing, has recently emerged as a powerful approach to material development."</em> <a href="https://www.umass.edu/news/article/umass-amherst-and-georgia-tech-researchers-3d-print-first-high-performance">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Algorithms designed to ensure multiple users share a network fairly can’t prevent some users from hogging all the bandwidth. When users want to send data over the internet faster than the network can handle, congestion can occur — the same way traffic congestion snarls the morning commute into a big city. Computers and devices that transmit data over the internet break the data down into smaller packets and use a special algorithm to decide how fast to send those packets. These congestion control algorithms seek to fully discover and utilize available network capacity while sharing it fairly with other users who may be sharing the same network. These algorithms try to minimize delay caused by data waiting in queues in the network. Over the past decade, researchers in industry and academia have developed several algorithms that attempt to achieve high rates while controlling delays."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/algorithm-computer-network-bandwidth-0804">[...]</a>

The initial goal of the project was to create a clock for a child that would simply tell them if it was time to wake up or not.

A solid use case would be work from home environments because it could 1) allow the person working to quickly see if they should be wrapping up soon (since it is easy to get caught up and lose track of time) and 2) allow family members, especially younger ones, to know if they can go talk to the person working."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/bigboystoys13/simple-clock-with-rgb-indicator-set-using-gps-4dd47d">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This project starts in 2020 during pandemic lockdown, after that it have loong periods of dust collecting. Now is ready to start collect data and the code and the setup will be shared with the world! The setup is changed a lot during the two yers, in the first version i've imaged to record data on an SDcard as txt file and do not use any battery related precautions (a power bank that lasts some hours) then the second version saves data on sd card + via Bluetooth Serial (android app) the data will be transmitted to a mobile phone and then parsed in excel the latest version do not store data, but the readings are sent to thingspeak. with a RTC (real time clock on pin 2 as interrupt) the device exit from deepsleep every 6 hours. As environmental guide I work on a river (canoeing) and the curiosity to know some river's parameters is obviously great! This log is intended as self-learning work, if someone have some suggestion on my hobby-work feel free to comment!"</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/marcohanselmi/bilasens-gsm-river-water-sensor-770b24">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In this tutorial, I will be walking you through the steps of building an Arduino alarm clock with an apple watch charger from scratch. Since I am building this from scratch, the process of building the housing for the circuit requires some machinery that cannot be found in everyday households (e.g Laser cutters, CNC machines, and 3D printers). That being said you can always still use the circuit and code while making your own housing for the product. I made this as a school project. Having already looked online for code and tutorials on how to make an alarm clock I found that once I followed all the steps, the clock never seemed to work, some seemed too complicated and others unfinished. As a result, I decided to try and code my own clock from scratch without using an RTC, This clock uses the millis() function instead."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Alarm-Clock-Apple-Watch-Charger/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Build a voice-activated LED light strip controller on the cheap with Raspberry Pi Pico. LED light strips, sometimes called “Neopixels” in the maker community, are the perfect choice for interior lighting. They’re easy to install, inexpensive, and are completely programmable. Simply connect the light strips to a microcontroller, write some code to make whatever lighting pattern you want, and you’re good to go! Unfortunately for me, however, I’m lazy. I have no desire to get up and change the pattern if I get bored or turn it off if I want to go to bed."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/AlexWulff/voice-activated-led-strip-for-10-pi-pico-and-edge-impulse-d11fc9">[...]</a>

The idea for the Smart Plant Monitor was derived from Deep Dive Codings IOT bootcamp. The idea was to design a functional device that would sense irritants, climate, and moisture levels for the health and well being of a plant. A pot and stand were designed via 3D CAD modeling and printing. The device is setup for a Dracena Warnecki "Dragon Tree" plant that requires light in-direct sunlight and 1 watering a week with a moisture reading of less than 1800. The device will water the plant based upon those conditions."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/kevin-flores/smart-plant-monitoring-system-ea23e6">[...]</a>

Story My mum has a portable WiFi device which is most time in her room, so the WiFi doesn't get to the living room and that's a problem but I love to solve problems so I did some googling and I found a GitHub repository for an ESP8266 repeater by martin-ger, the repo had a binary file for the repeater so I just flashed it into my esp8266 using esptool and it worked like magic. Click here to access the repository; however, there were some problems I had with this repeater(extender): - The web UI interface can't scan for WiFi networks so I don't know when I am in the range of the router unless I use the serial interface. - The web UI interface can't scan for WiFi networks so I don't know when I am in the range of the router unless I use the serial interface. - Debugging can be carried out by noting the rate at which the led is blinking, but there is a catch, the led state when it is connected to the router and when my phone connects to it as an access point is the same, so I get confused because I can't tell if is connected to the router or if my phone is connected to it."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/pius4109/esp8266-wifi-range-extender-arduino-7cabdf">[...]</a>

According to the sound pressure captured by Mic, this device shows sound levels with LEDs. As the LM3915 requires predefined input voltage levels for correct operation, a pre-amplifier circuit is utilized for amplifying the weak Mic input signal. For dynamically displaying sound pressure levels with 10 LEDs, the LM3915 bar/dot display driver chip should be configured to support a certain input voltage range such as 60mV ~ 1.25V. I bought about 10EA of these chips quite a long time ago (Maybe more than 10 years ago!).
