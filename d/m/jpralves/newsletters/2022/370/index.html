<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1787, o químico sueco <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nils_Gabriel_Sefstr%C3%B6m">Nils Gabriel Sefström</a>. Ele descobriu o elemento vanádio. Ele examinou minério de ferro depois de um gerente de mina ter apontado um teste interessante. Foi-lhe dito, se um lote de minério fosse tratado com ácido clorídrico e aparecesse um pó preto, então o ferro seria quebradiço. Através de um estudo mais aprofundado, descobriu que isto nem sempre era verdade, pois por vezes aparecia um pó preto de ferro que não era quebradiço (1831). Pela análise do pó, embora semelhante ao crómio ou ao urânio, ele determinou que se tratava de um novo elemento. Sefström deu-lhe o nome de vanádio, em homenagem a uma deusa nórdica. Uma descoberta anterior, mas provisória, tinha sido feita em 1801 por Andrés Manuel del Río, um mineralogista espanhol que não tinha confiança na sua descoberta de um novo elemento a que deu o nome de eritrónio. Este foi mais tarde descoberto como sendo o mesmo que o vanádio.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1881, o Engenheiro electrotécnico inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._J._Round">H. J. Round</a>. Ele foi responsável por inúmeras invenções que contribuíram para o desenvolvimento das comunicações via rádio. Entrou para a Companhia Marconi em 1902, e pelo seu trabalho mais antigo concebeu os elementos de equipamento de procura de direcção. Tornou-se Chefe da Marconi Research em 1921. Foi um inventor prolífico. Entre outras invenções, concebeu o Straight Eight Gramophone Recording System, um sistema de discurso público de grande audiência que foi utilizado para transmitir o discurso do Rei Jorge nas Exposições de Wembley. Um sistema de imagem falante que ele inventou foi utilizado para gravar som para filmar durante o boom do cinema dos anos 30. No total, ele produziu 117 patentes. A última foi "Pressure Wave Transmission Arrangements" (1964), aos 83 anos de idade.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1903, o físico americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Morris_Page">Robert Morris Page</a>. Ele inventou a tecnologia do radar de pulso enquanto trabalhava no Laboratório de Investigação Naval dos Estados Unidos. Do trabalho pioneiro com os primeiros líderes de rádio, o Dr. Page concebeu e desenvolveu circuitos e componentes nos anos 30 para os primeiros sistemas de radar de pulso que utilizavam pequenas explosões de radiação electromagnética para detectar e localizar objectos distantes. Durante a II Guerra Mundial, esta invenção foi vital para os Aliados para a detecção de aviões, navios e outros alvos inimigos. Após a guerra, Page continuou a investigação sobre aplicações em tempo de paz de radar, rádio de bordo e outros campos da electrónica. Detinha sessenta e cinco patentes para inovações nestes campos, agora aplicadas na navegação, previsão do tempo, astronomia, automatização e campos técnicos relacionados.</p>

<p>Em 1954, o primeiro teste de um avião VTOL tem lugar quando um Convair XFY-1 Pogo demonstrou uma descolagem e aterragem verticais. Era conhecido como "Tail Sitter", mas como protótipo para testar o conceito, a sua glória queimou, e desvaneceu-se numa questão de meses. O XFY-1 era um protótipo de um caça interceptor de defesa pontual destinado à Marinha. A única virtude era que não precisava de uma pista de aterragem, pois o XFY-1 foi construído para se sentar direito na sua cauda, e descolar a direito, usando enormes hélices contra-rotativas no seu nariz. Após a descolagem, um assentador de cauda mudou de voo vertical estilo helicóptero para avião, empurrando simplesmente da ascensão vertical para o voo horizontal convencional. Na aterragem, o processo foi invertido para aterrar na sua cauda. Era demasiado difícil de voar.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que a NASA está a preparar o helicóptero Ingenuity que se encontra em Marte, para conseguir-se manter operacional durante o "inverno" que está a começar neste planeta. Dados da telemetria demonstram que a perda de comunicação com o equipamento foi devido a falta de energia na bateria, decorrente das noites maiores. Desafios como estes são de esperar: Após centenas de sols e dezenas de voos para além dos cinco voos inicialmente previstos, o helicóptero movido a energia solar encontra-se em terreno inexplorado. Estamos agora a operar muito para além dos nossos limites originais de concepção. Historicamente, Marte é um grande desafio para as naves espaciais (particularmente as movidas a energia solar). Cada sol pode ser o último da Ingenuidade.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker e alguns vídeos interessantes.</p>

<p><em>"As detailed in our last blog post, for the first time in our yearlong extended mission we had a loss of communications with Ingenuity from the downlink of May 3 (Sol 427) and May 4 (Sol 428). After a week of anomaly investigation, two sols dedicated to data collection, and the heroic efforts of the Perseverance and Ingenuity operations teams, I am very happy to report that we have reestablished reliable communications with Ingenuity. Based on all available telemetry, the helicopter appears healthy, and we have resumed a modified form of operations. Assuming winter recommissioning activities complete nominally, Ingenuity’s 29th flight may occur in the next few sols. Telemetry from Ingenuity confirmed that the loss of communications was due to insufficient battery state-of-charge (SOC) going into the night, which resulted in a reset of our mission clock. This daily SOC deficit is likely to persist for the duration of Martian winter (until September/October)."</em> <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/status/382/ingenuity-adapts-for-mars-winter-operations/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The rover’s weather sensors witnessed daily whirlwinds and more while studying the Red Planet. During its first couple hundred days in Jezero Crater, NASA’s Perseverance Mars rover saw some of the most intense dust activity ever witnessed by a mission sent to the Red Planet’s surface. Not only did the rover detect hundreds of dust-bearing whirlwinds called dust devils, Perseverance captured the first video ever recorded of wind gusts lifting a massive Martian dust cloud. A paper recently published in Science Advances chronicles the trove of weather phenomena observed in the first 216 Martian days, or sols. The new findings enable scientists to better understand dust processes on Mars and contribute to a body of knowledge that could one day help them predict the dust storms that Mars is famous for – and that pose a threat to future robotic and human explorers. “Every time we land in a new place on Mars, it’s an opportunity to better understand the planet’s weather,” said the paper’s lead author, Claire Newman of Aeolis Research, a research company focused on planetary atmospheres."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-perseverance-studies-the-wild-winds-of-jezero-crater">[...]</a>

Thanks to an innovative approach to processing substrates in its assembly and test factory, Intel delivered millions of additional units of chip production over the past year – meeting customer demand while the industry struggled to weather a shortage of this critical component. Since the beginning of the global pandemic, surging demand for computing has placed the semiconductor industry at the epicenter of unprecedented supply chain disruptions. This has created a shortage of key chipmaking components, including a foundational piece of nearly every advanced processor in the world: the Ajinomoto build-up film (ABF) substrate. Before a computer chip leaves the factory, it is mounted between a substrate and a heat spreader to form a completed processor. This “package” protects the chip and forms electrical connections between the processor and the circuit board in a computer."</em> <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-factory-helps-overcome-substrate-shortages.html#gs.2mo3ey#gs.2mo3ey">[...]</a>

In a new study published in Nature Materials, the researchers have identified the root cause of this dendrite formation – the appearance of microscopic voids in one of the electrodes early on. They also show that adding a thin layer of certain metals to the electrolyte surface significantly delays dendrite formation, extending the battery’s life and enabling it to be charged faster.

In modern computers errors during processing and storage of information have become a rarity due to high-quality fabrication. However, for critical applications, where even single errors can have serious effects, error correction mechanisms based on redundancy of the processed data are still used. Quantum computers are inherently much more susceptible to disturbances and will thus probably always require error correction mechanisms, because otherwise errors will propagate uncontrolled in the system and information will be lost.

<p><em>"Researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Korea’s Sungkyunkwan University are using advanced microscopy to nanoengineer promising materials for computing and electronics in a beyond-Moore era. Historically, computers have become faster and more powerful by Moore’s Law, an observation that technology advances as transistor sizes shrink. Today’s nanometer-scale transistors are reaching practical limits and new approaches are needed to scale existing technology. A team at ORNL’s Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences applied a focused beam of helium ions to locally tailor ferroelectricity in a metal oxide thin film, enhancing a useful property for transistors and memory. Results published in Science show how light ion microscopy can unlock unique functionalities in materials and create new pathways to design future devices. "This project highlights the advanced ion beam and scanning probe capabilities available to CNMS users, which open new frontiers to locally control and understand materials properties on the nanoscale," said ORNL's Liam Collins."</em> <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/news/microscopy-beyond-moores-law">[...]</a>

<p><em>"“Finding something so novel that it might be included in textbooks as fundamental knowledge is every scientist’s dream,” says Prof. Dr. Jan Paradies, a professor at Paderborn University. Paradies, a chemist, recently discovered a previously unprecedented reaction in which an entire molecular fragment migrates to another location in the particle. “Such rearrangements are extremely rare, but they are invaluable because they only move via a very specific pathway and yield only a single product. In the future, for example, this will make it possible to simply and efficiently produce bioactive substances, such as health-promoting, beneficial ingredients in food,” explains Paradies. The results have now been published in the renowned professional journal Angewandte Chemie (“Applied Chemistry”). Chemistry deals with the transformation of matter, specifically the transformation of one molecule into another."</em> <a href="https://www.uni-paderborn.de/en/news-item/98073">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Wide-band wavelength division multiplexing technology significantly expands transmission capacity allowing Pb/s transmission in only 4 spatial channels Researchers from the Network Research Institute at the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT, President: TOKUDA Hideyuki, Ph.D.) report the world's first demonstration of more than 1 petabit per second in a multi-core fiber (MCF) with a standard diameter of 0.125 mm. The researchers, led by Benjamin J. Puttnam, constructed a transmission system that supports a record optical bandwidth exceeding 20 THz by exploiting wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technology. It incorporates the commercially adopted optical fiber transmission windows known as C and L-bands and extends the transmission bandwidth to include also the recently explored S-band. Two kinds of doped fiber amplifiers along with Raman amplification with pumps added in a novel multi-core pump combiner, enabled transmission of 801 wavelength channels over the 20 THz optical bandwidth. The large number of wavelength channels were transmitted in each core of a 4-core MCF that is notable for having the same cladding diameter as a standard optical fiber. Such fibers are compatible with current cabling technologies and do not require the complex signal processing needed for unscrambling signals in multi-mode fibers, meaning conventional transceiver hardware may be used."</em> <a href="https://www.nict.go.jp/en/press/2022/05/30-1.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Additive leads to protective surface layer for nickel-rich cathodes, improving battery performance at high voltages. A team of researchers led by chemists at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Brookhaven National Laboratory has learned that an electrolyte additive allows stable high-voltage cycling of nickel-rich layered cathodes. Their work could lead to improvements in the energy density of lithium batteries that power electric vehicles. The findings, published on May 9 in Nature Energy, offer a remedy to notorious degradation problems that crop up for nickel-rich cathode materials, especially at high voltages. This research was conducted as part of the DOE-sponsored Battery500 Consortium, which is led by DOE’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and is working to significantly increase the energy density of lithium batteries for electric vehicles. Sha Tan, a co-first author and Ph.D. candidate at Stony Brook University conducting research with the Electrochemical Energy Storage group at Brookhaven Lab, was originally studying how an additive, lithium difluorophosphate (LiPO2F2), could be used to improve low-temperature performance of batteries."</em> <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=119584">[...]</a>

This gives rise to a lasing effect for sound. To their surprise, they discovered new mechanisms, so-called ‘geometric phases’, with which they can manipulate and transmit sound in systems where that was thought to be impossible. “This opens the way to new types of (meta)materials with properties that we do not yet know from existing materials,” says group leader Ewold Verhagen who, together with shared first authors Javier del Pino and Jesse Slim, publishes the surprising results on June 2 in Nature. The response of electrons and other charged particles to magnetic fields leads to many unique phenomena in materials. “For a long time, we have wanted to know whether an effect similar to a magnetic field on electrons could be achieved on sound, which has no charge,” says Verhagen."</em> <a href="https://amolf.nl/news/discovery-of-new-mechanisms-to-control-the-flow-of-sound">[...]</a>

The process is described in a paper published in Nature Communications. It shows how focused ultrasound waves can be used to create sonochemical reactions in minuscule cavitation regions — essentially tiny bubbles.

This is the first time that a crystal from the technologically attractive group of zeolites has been made usable for a broad field of potential applications. The delamination process developed in Bayreuth under the direction of Prof. Dr. Josef Breu is characterised by the fact that the structures of the nanosheets isolated from each other remain undamaged.

<p><em>"Over half a year ago now, while trying to think up ideas for a project, I found a tutorial for a pen plotter that used the stepper motor mechanisms contained within DVD and or CD computer drives to create a CNC platform. These drives became a very common scrap part after disk drives went the way of the dinosaur in PCs, so I was sure I could find some to use for this project. Unfortunately for me, the instructions proved to be inadequate in many ways, with vital information missing, confusing grammar, and significant portions of the project being explained vaguely or not at all, simply appearing in the next step without reason. These issues frustrated me, and while I could have spent the time to fill in the blanks myself, I found that I could, and wanted to, make my own project. Along the way, the pen plotter turned into a laser engraver and with that came many other alterations that I designed, prototyped, and implemented myself. It is because of this that I can call this project my own, and I hope that you will follow along as I show you how to build one for yourself."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Laser-Engraver-Made-With-Repurposed-CDDVD-Computer/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A Wheatstone bridge is an electrical circuit used to measure an unknown electrical resistance by balancing two legs of a bridge circuit, one leg of which includes the unknown component. The primary benefit of the circuit is its ability to provide extremely accurate measurements (in contrast with something like a simple voltage divider). Its operation is similar to the original potentiometer. The Wheatstone bridge circuit mainly consists of two known resistors, one variable resistor, one unknown resistor (whose value to be calculated) and a Galvanometer (detect and measure small amounts of current in an electrical circuit). In the place of the resistors and galvanometer I have used small bulbs which I got from old decorative lighting strip. The resistance of all the bulbs are same."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Wheatstone-Bridge/">[...]</a>

Up to my Tinker CAD project, I had limited skills in CAD and electrical design. After some time researching, I consider myself abled in both CAD design and electrical design (By no-means am I a professional so please take this advice with a grain of salt and feel free to let me know of any errors or improvements). For this Instructable, I will betrying to teach you the skills to design your own Button Box, as opposed to a set-in-stone final product, so my final product may look a little different than my examples. For this Instructable, I recommend some exposure to Fusion360 or CAD software as I do not go in-depth on the basics of CAD. Some skills you can expect to learn in this Instructable are: How to utilize Parameters in Fusion360 to create your Button Box Housing How to create your own schematic for your own button box How to utilize your own schematic to create a schematic in Fusion360 Howto create your own electrical library for your schematic in Fusion360 How to transform a schematic in Fusion360 to a PCB How to Auto-Route nets for your PCB Unfortunately, I will not be teaching you to code your button box, as I do not yet feel comfortable in sharing code that I've designed."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Design-a-Button-Box-Housing-With-Schematic-/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Cornstarch mini pottery machine, and built with an old printer and cd-player My idea was born from the experience of seeing and buying samples of miniature pottery made of clay. Some time later, I had the concern to learn to work this art but with recycled material and I found that in my country it is popular to do it with corn starch only that certain rules had to be followed to obtain a good quality mixture. Finally, I am exploring this project that continually undergoes changes because I am experiencing many things that I share with you in this work. This is a machine that I use to work miniature pottery made mainly with cornstarch. This is a sustainable idea that respects nature and promotes the circular economy This is a project focused on sustainability, and in its first version I faced the challenges shown below: - Reuse and modify an old printer to place and organize the components and supplies for this project; - Reuse an old cd-payer motor to work and experiment with miniature pottery; - Recycle organic matter such as cornstarch to create miniature pottery. To achieve this goal, I have experimented and found the amount of material necessary to obtain a good job, that is, of good quality and resistance; and - This work promotes the circular economy, since it proposes a completely different approach that allows stimulating economic growth and generating self-employment without compromising the environment."</em> <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/185464-cornstarch-pottery-machine">[...]</a>
