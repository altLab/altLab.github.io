<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1774, o físico e matemático francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Baptiste_Biot">Jean-Baptiste Biot</a>. Ele, com Felix Savart, desenvolveu a lei Biot-Savart, segundo a qual a intensidade do campo magnético produzido pelo fluxo de corrente através de um fio varia inversamente com a distância do fio. Ele trabalhou em astronomia, elasticidade, calor, óptica, electricidade e magnetismo. Na matemática pura, ele contribuiu para a geometria. Em 1804 fez uma subida de 13.000 pés (5-km) de balão de ar quente com Joseph Gay-Lussac para investigar a atmosfera. Em 1806, acompanhou François Arago a Espanha para completar ali os trabalhos anteriores para medir o arco do meridiano. Biot descobriu a actividade óptica em 1815, a capacidade de uma substância rodar o plano de polarização da luz, que lançou a base para a sacarimetria, uma técnica útil de análise de soluções açucaradas.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1830, o inventor e fabricante britânico <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Starley">James Starley</a>. Ele ficou conhecido como o pai da indústria da bicicleta. Starley deixou a quinta familiar na adolescência e depois de ter trabalhado inicialmente como jardineiro, recorreu a interesses mecânicos. Melhorou a primeira máquina de costura, e por volta de 1861, estava no negócio com Josiah Turner como a Coventry Sewing Machine Company. Em poucos anos, a sua fábrica começou a produzir bicicletas. Em 1870, entrou no negócio por conta própria, produzindo as suas máquinas de costura Europa e as bicicletas Ariel, "penny-farthing" e triciclos. A Ariel, uma bicicleta leve totalmente metálica (1871), é considerada como a primeira bicicleta verdadeira, a primeira bicicleta de duas rodas auto-propulsionada a utilizar a direcção pivô-central. A sua roda de direcção tangente-tensão (1876) ainda é utilizada.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1882, o físico experimental norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Williams_Bridgman">Percy Williams Bridgman</a>. Ele ficou conhecido pelos seus estudos de materiais a altas temperaturas e pressões. Foi galardoado com o Prémio Nobel da Física em 1946 pela sua "invenção de um aparelho para produzir pressões extremamente elevadas, e pelas descobertas que fez com ele no campo da física de alta pressão". Foi o primeiro físico de Harvard a receber um Prémio Nobel da Física. Em 1908, iniciou o seu primeiro trabalho experimental com pressões estáticas elevadas de cerca de 6.500 atmosferas. Eventualmente, ele atingiu cerca de 400.000 atmosferas. Durante os estudos das mudanças de fase dos sólidos sob pressão, ele descobriu várias formas de alta pressão de gelo. Bridgman também escreveu eloquentemente sobre assuntos de interesse geral na física da sua época.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1951, o matemático norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Freedman">Michael Freedman</a>. Ele recebeu a Medalha Fields em 1986 pela sua prova da conjectura em quatro dimensões (1982). A conjectura de Poincaré, um dos famosos problemas da matemática do século XX, afirma que um colector tridimensional fechado simplesmente ligado é uma esfera tridimensional. A conjectura dimensional superior de Poincaré afirma que qualquer n-manifold fechado que seja homotopia equivalente à n-esfera deve ser a n-esfera. Para valores de n pelo menos 5, foi dada uma solução por Smale em 1961. Duas décadas depois, a Freedman provou a conjectura para n = 4. No entanto, a conjectura original para n=3 permaneceu em aberto. Grigori Perelman deu uma prova completa em 2003.</p>

<p>E foi lançado hoje o Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. Com a designação de "Jammy Jellyfish" esta versão de Ubuntu é uma LTS, isto significa que irá ter 5 anos de suporte. De entre as novidades podemos destacar o Kernel Linux 5.15 LTS. Esta versão inclui alguns componentes do GNOME 42. O compilador de sistema é o GCC 11.2. Nos equipamentos suportados destaca-se os novos Raspberry PI Zero 2W e os Raspberry PI 4.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou, três astronautas chineses regressaram à Terra depois de terem estado no espaço 183 dias. Os astronautas da missão Shenzhou-13 regressaram no passado dia 16, depois da missão mais longa feita por astronautas chineses. O Objectivo da China para este ano é de enviar para a estação espacial que está a construir - a Tiangong - dois módulos experimentais, duas naves tripuladas e duas naves de carga.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker e alguns vídeos interessantes.</p>

<p><em>"The Mastcam-Z camera recorded video of Phobos, one of the Red Planet’s two moons, to study how its orbit is changing over time. NASA’s Perseverance Mars rover has captured dramatic footage of Phobos, Mars’ potato-shaped moon, crossing the face of the Sun. These observations can help scientists better understand the moon’s orbit and how its gravity pulls on the Martian surface, ultimately shaping the Red Planet’s crust and mantle. Captured with Perseverance’s next-generation Mastcam-Z camera on April 2, the 397th Martian day, or sol, of the mission, the eclipse lasted a little over 40 seconds – much shorter than a typical solar eclipse involving Earth’s Moon. (Phobos is about 157 times smaller than Earth’s Moon. Mars’ other moon, Deimos, is even smaller.)"</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-perseverance-rover-captures-video-of-solar-eclipse-on-mars">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The SST26LF064RT memory device is Microchip’s second SuperFlash technology-based offering to be space qualified. Designers of spaceflight-qualified systems have a great need to reduce development time, cost and risk in their systems. Microchip Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP) proposed the concept of starting with Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) devices and then replacing them with space-qualified, Radiation-Tolerant (RT) equivalent parts. Microchip today announces it has extended its family of COTS-based, RT SuperFlash® devices for these applications and is bringing the Microchip memory technology’s unrivaled 50 kilorad (krad) Total Ionizing Dose (TID) tolerance to a 64-Mbit serial quad I/O NOR flash memory device for use in harsh aerospace and defense system environments. “The SST26LF064RT SuperFlash device brings the best TID performance on the market to a 64-Mbit serial quad I/O memory solution that works alongside any SRAM-based FPGA in diverse space applications,” said Bob Vampola, associate vice president of Aerospace and Defense at Microchip. “It is ideal for systems used in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) space constellations and other harsh radiation environments where companion flash memory is required for storing the critical software code or bitstream that drives the complete system.” Microchip SuperFlash NOR flash memory products use a proprietary split-gate cell architecture to improve performance, data retention and reliability as compared to conventional stacked-gate flash."</em> <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/about/news-releases/products/serial-64-mbit-superflash-memory">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://uk.kyocera.com/news/2022/04/21092347.html">Kyocera develops transmissive metasurface technology that redirects wireless signals for improved 5G and 6G performance</a></h2>

<p><em>"Kyocera Corporation (President: Hideo Tanimoto) has developed a Transmissive Metasurface technology that can redirect wireless network signals in a specific direction to improve the coverage area and performance of 5G and eventually 6G networks. The Transmissive Metasurface will help deliver high-frequency millimeter-wave 5G and 6G to places where communication is impossible due to obstacles, expanding service areas beyond the capability of conventional Reflective Metasurface technologies used today. The 28 GHz band used in 5G networks, and the higher frequency band being studied for 6G, have a high degree of rectilinear propagation. Signals often cannot reach locations where a direct line of sight to the base station is obstructed. Reflective Metasurface technology offers a very limited ability to change the direction of a signal to reach these areas. To solve this issue and expand performance, Kyocera developed a new Transmissive Metasurface technology that can redirect radio waves at smaller angles to extend targeted network coverage."</em> <a href="https://uk.kyocera.com/news/2022/04/21092347.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Propelling micrometre-sized drones using light only and exerting precise control: Physicists at the University of Würzburg have succeeded at this for the first time. Their microdrones are significantly smaller than red blood cells. A hand-held laser pointer produces no noticeable recoil forces when it is "fired" - even though it emits a directed stream of light particles. The reason for this is its very large mass compared to the very small recoil impulses that the light particles cause when leaving the laser pointer. However, it has long been clear that optical recoil forces can indeed have a very large effect on correspondingly small particles. For example, the tails of comets point away from the Sun partly due to light pressure."</em> <a href="https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/en/news-and-events/news/detail/news/licht-motoren-fuer-mikrodrohnen-1/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Drawing lessons from the compound eyes of trilobites, NIST researchers fabricate tiny lenses that see both near and far. Five hundred million years ago, the oceans teemed with trillions of trilobites — creatures that were distant cousins of horseshoe crabs. All trilobites had a wide range of vision, thanks to compound eyes — single eyes composed of tens to thousands of tiny independent units, each with their own cornea, lens and light-sensitive cells. But one group, Dalmanitina socialis, was exceptionally farsighted. Their bifocal eyes, each mounted on stalks and composed of two lenses that bent light at different angles, enabled these sea creatures to simultaneously view prey floating nearby as well as distant enemies approaching from more than a kilometer away. Inspired by the eyes of D. socialis, researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have developed a miniature camera featuring a bifocal lens with a record-setting depth of field — the distance over which the camera can produce sharp images in a single photo."</em> <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/04/inspired-prehistoric-creatures-nist-researchers-make-record-setting-lenses">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2022/04/20/new-technique-3d-printing/">Stanford engineers develop new kind of 3D printing</a></h2>

<p><em>"Engineers at Stanford and Harvard have laid the groundwork for a new system for 3D printing that doesn’t require that an object be printed from the bottom up. While 3D printing techniques have advanced significantly in the last decade, the technology continues to face a fundamental limitation: objects must be built up layer by layer. But what if they didn’t have to be? Dan Congreve, an assistant professor of electrical engineering at Stanford and former Rowland Fellow at the Rowland Institute at Harvard University, and his colleagues have developed a way to print 3D objects within a stationary volume of resin. The printed object is fully supported by the thick resin – imagine an action figure floating in the center of a block of Jell-O – so it can be added to from any angle. This removes the need for the support structures typically required for creating complex designs with more standard printing methods."</em> <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2022/04/20/new-technique-3d-printing/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.uu.nl/en/news/new-promising-nanogel-separates-chemicals-continuously">New promising nanogel separates chemicals continuously</a></h2>

<p><em>"Nanomaterials scientists from Utrecht University have improved a nanogel in such a way that it can now transport individual molecules from one liquid to the other. “By enlarging the surface area between two liquids, we can increase the exchange of chemicals. This technique can make industrial processes more energy efficient and open possibilities to make better solar cells.” The researchers’ paper was recently published by the scientific magazine Advanced Materials. Physical Chemist Martin Haase and his research group work on techniques to make so-called bijels: emulsions of two liquids that do not mix, like oil and water, separated by an ultra-thin layer of nanoparticles that stabilizes the surface between the fluids. “In such gel-like materials, two repellent liquids are interwoven”, Haase explains. “At the interface of the two, molecules can move from one liquid to the other through the nanolayer.” The gels work best if the interface between the two liquids has a large surface."</em> <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en/news/new-promising-nanogel-separates-chemicals-continuously">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scientists use ‘impressive’ chemistry that opens new doors for hard drives and other cutting-edge technology Sometimes making a brand-new type of box requires outside-the-box thinking, which is exactly what Spartan chemists used to create an eight-atom, magnetic cube. That tiny box is at the heart of a new magnetic molecule that could power future technologies for data storage, quantum computing and more. “In the beginning, our approach seemed like a really wild idea,” said Selvan Demir, an assistant professor of chemistry in the College of Natural Science. “But, it turns out it works.” Demir and her team published their work in the journal Chem, which featured the research on the cover of its March 10 issue. Part of what made the researchers’ idea so wild was their choice to work with starting ingredients that are notoriously finicky in the chemistry community. One ingredient is a group of elements referred to as lanthanides, which occupy a special row toward the bottom of the periodic table of elements."</em> <a href="https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2022/single-molecule-magnet">[...]</a>

The work, published in the journal Optics Express, uses a sapphire optical fibre – a thread of industrially grown sapphire less than half a millimetre thick – which can withstand temperatures over 2000°C. When light is injected onto one end of the sapphire fibre, some is reflected back from a point along the fibre which has been modified to be sensitive to temperature (known as a Bragg grating). The wavelength (colour) of this reflected light is a measure of the temperature at that point. The research resolves a 20-year-old problem with existing sensors that, whilst the sapphire fibre seems very thin, in comparison to the wavelength of light it is huge. This means that the light can take many different paths along the sapphire fibre, which results in many different wavelengths being reflected at once."</em> <a href="https://eng.ox.ac.uk/news/sapphire-fibre-could-enable-cleaner-energy-and-air-travel/">[...]</a>

Instead, Venus would be locked in place, always facing the sun the way the same side of the moon always faces Earth. The gravity of a large object in space can keep a smaller object from spinning, a phenomenon called tidal locking. Because it prevents this locking, a UC Riverside scientist argues the atmosphere needs to be a more prominent factor in studies of Venus as well as other planets. These arguments, as well as descriptions of Venus as a partially tidally locked planet, were published today in a Nature Astronomy article. “We think of the atmosphere as a thin, almost separate layer on top of a planet that has minimal interaction with the solid planet,” said Stephen Kane, UCR astrophysicist and lead paper author."</em> <a href="https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2022/04/20/why-venus-rotates-slowly-despite-suns-powerful-grip">[...]</a>

A lot of early, hand drawn PCBs had this look, where every connection is smooth and slightly melted. When people first switched to using computers to design circuit boards, the routing options were very limited and traces were forced to have sharp corners. Some people forget that our tendency to restrict traces to 45° angles is mainly a holdover from before there were any other options. Some of the benefits of teardrops and smooth traces are controversial, but the following can generally be agreed upon: - Smooth corners are potentially less prone to errors in the etching process - In the case of drill/pad misalignment, teardrops reduce the chance of a breakout - For flexible PCBs, sharp corners are stress concentrators, so removing them reduces the chance of cracking - Denser routing is possible when arbitrary angles are permitted - There may be some electromagnetic compliance (EMC) benefits, since sharp transitions represent a sudden change in impedance That last point is the one people tend to dwell on.

<p><em>"Introduction One day I thought about the performance gap between the first Intel processor and modern machines. Of course, we can try to do some estimations empirically – we know clock rate and how the pipeline is organized and what features intel 4004 CPU has (but it would not be standard FLOPS, because there was no embedded support for float numbers yet). But there are few details: architecture bit width (only 4 bits in comparison with modern 64 bits! ), very limited instruction set (it’s missing even basic logical operators like AND or XOR) and peripheral limitations (ROM/RAM accesses). So I decided to research the subject in practice. After some thinking, I chose π number calculation as a benchmark."</em> <a href="https://mark.engineer/2022/04/calculating-pi-digits-on-first-intel-microprocessor-intel-4004/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The TMS9918 from Texas Instruments and its derivatives were widely used video chips in the 1980s. So they were built into many popular home computers and game consoles of the time, such as the ColecoVision, CreatiVision, Memotech MTX, MSX, SG-1000/SC-3000, Spectravideo, Sord M5, Tatung Einstein, Texas Instruments TI-99/4, Casio PV-2000, and Tomy Tutor. The original TMS9918/9918A outputs NTSC composite video, but there is also a variant for PAL (TMS9928/TMS9928A). All these variants are referred to as Video Display Processor (VDP). The VDP has its own video RAM, which is separate from the system RAM. It was originally intended for use with 4116 DRAM chips, but these are rare nowadays and also require three different supply voltages, making them more cumbersome to handle."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/michalin70/arduino-library-for-the-tms9918-video-dislplay-processor-4087a3">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Build a small circuit from salvaged components, to make an LED shine brightly from low-voltage sources. I feel a special connection to this circuit – whether you call it the "One-Volt LED" (named by Z. Kaparnik in 1999), or the "Vampire Micro Torch" or "Joule Thief" (designed in 2002 by Big Clive). The essence of this popular circuit comes from Kaparnik's article in Everyday Practical Electronics, which included schematics for a "Bright Light" that will power LEDs for ages, pulling the leftover energy out of a nearly-dead 1.2V or 1.5V battery. It's a truly magical little circuit, and versatile enough to work with a broad range of odd NPN transistors, salvaged ferrite cores, and "unusable" batteries. Sustainability heaven! The circuit OK, OK... it's really not ALL that mysterious."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/glowascii/joule-thief-pcb-power-from-dead-batteries-651d67">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Perhaps the most convoluted walking mechanism I've ever seen, "Wacky Walker" was a lot of fun to design, 3D print, assemble, test, and, most important, watch in action! The inspiration for this model came from JK Brickworks Lego reproduction of a late 1980s toy known as "BearMobill" (yes, me neither). The model incorporates a motorized chassis hanging from an oval track having free rotating legs. When the chassis passes beyond the front pair of legs, it's weight is tuned just enough to flip the oval track over bringing the previously rear legs to the front to repeat the process. Designed using Autodesk Fusion 360, sliced using Ultimaker Cura 4.12.1, and 3D printed in PLA on Ultimaker S5s. I acquired the following parts: - One N20 30RPM 6VDC gear motor."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Wacky-Walker/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A few weeks ago, a video appeared in my recommended video feed from Tim at GrandIllusions (https://www.youtube.com/c/grandillusions) showing a crayon line following toy car designed forty years ago that had no electronics whatsoever, but no operational details were provided (Tim was perplexed regarding how the car operated). Not long after that, John at RobotHut (https://www.youtube.com/user/Robothut) sent me a link to a video of a design he created of a three motor version of the crayon following car. Between the two videos, and always loving to design, 3D print and assemble mechanisms, I designed this single motor crayon following car using a flexible 3D printed TPU axle to transfer rotary motion from the rear wheel to the front wheels. The theory behind the design is elegantly simple. A single rear wheel drives the car forward while the counter rotating front wheels "sense" the crayon line. When the counter rotating front wheels come in contact with the sticky wax crayon line, they are designed to steer the car away from the line."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Crayon-Car-Mechanism/">[...]</a>
