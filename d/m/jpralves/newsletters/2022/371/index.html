<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1768, o engenheiro mecânico anglo-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Slater">Samuel Slater</a>. Ele fundou a indústria americana do algodão-têxtil. Antes de deixar Nottingham e imigrar para os EUA em 1789, Slater aprendeu com Jedediah Strutt (sócio de Richard Arkwright) em Inglaterra. Uma vez nos EUA, encontrou apoio para construir a máquina de fiar e cardar Arkwright, com a qual estabeleceu a primeira fábrica de algodão de sucesso nos EUA em Pawtucket, Rhode Island, bem como muitas outras na região da Nova Inglaterra.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1781, o engenheiro e inventor inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephenson">George Stephenson</a>. Ele foi um dos principais pioneiros da locomotiva de caminho-de-ferro. A primeira linha férrea que construiu correu de Darlington a Stockton, que abriu a 27 de Setembro de 1825 quando grandes multidões o viram aos comandos da Locomotion ao puxar 36 vagões cheios de sacos de carvão e farinha. A viagem inicial de pouco menos de 9 milhas demorou duas horas. Os ensaios Rainhill de 1829, foi uma competição para a construção da locomotiva mais rápida. Ganhou com a sua famosa locomotiva, a Rocket, que viajou a uma velocidade nunca vista de 36 milhas por hora. Stephenson construiu então a linha Liverpool para Manchester, que abriu a 15 de Setembro de 1830. Ele é considerado como uma das pessoas mais influentes da Revolução Industrial na Europa.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1861, o químico russo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Heinrich_Johann_Apollon_Tammann">Gustav Heinrich Johann Apollon Tammann</a>. Ele ajudou a fundar a ciência da metalurgia e foi pioneiro no estudo da estrutura interna e propriedades físicas dos metais e suas ligas. Além disso, os seus estudos sobre equilíbrios heterogéneos (ou seja, o comportamento da matéria em função da composição química, temperatura e pressão) desempenharam um papel importante na sistematização da química inorgânica e contribuíram significativamente para o desenvolvimento da química física como disciplina. Em 1903, Gustav Tammann estabeleceu o primeiro Instituto de Química Inorgânica na Alemanha, antes de mudar o seu interesse de investigação para a química física dos metais e ligas.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1921, o inventor americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forrest_Bird">Forrest M. Bird</a>. Ele desenvolveu o primeiro respirador médico fiável, de baixo custo e produzido em massa, o Bird Universal Medical Respirator para cuidados cardiopulmonares agudos ou crónicos. Para continuar o seu desenvolvimento e comercialização, fundou a Bird Products Corporation (1954). Testou-o em doentes tão gravemente doentes que se esperava uma falha cardiopulmonar, mas muitos deles sobreviveram devido ao seu aparelho - que ficou conhecido como "o pássaro". Bird continuou a fazer melhorias. Foi amplamente adoptado por hospitais em todo o mundo. O respirador "Babybird", introduzido em 1970, reduziu grandemente as mortes de crianças devido a problemas respiratórios.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1930, o balonista americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Abruzzo">Ben Abruzzo</a>. Ele, com três companheiros de tripulação, fez o primeiro voo de balão transpacífico que foi também o mais longo voo sem escalas, na Double Eagle V. Treze andares de altura, o Double Eagle V com hélio, pilotado por Ben Abruzzo, Larry Newman, Ron Clark e Rocky Aoki do Japão, lançado de Nagashimi, Japão, a 10 de Novembro de 1981. Quando aterrou 84 horas, 31 minutos mais tarde na Floresta Nacional de Mendocino, Cal., o novo recorde de distância foi estabelecido em 5.768 milhas. Acompanhou também Maxie Anderson e Larry Newman no primeiro voo de balão transatlântico no Double Eagle II (11-17 de Agosto de 1978).</p>

<p>Em 1905, Albert Einstein publicou a sua análise da teoria quântica de Max Planck e a sua aplicação à luz. O seu artigo apareceu em Annalen der Physik. Embora não estivesse envolvido qualquer trabalho experimental, foi por estas ideias que Einstein ganhou o seu Prémio Nobel.</p>

<p>E nesta semana que passou os estados membros da união europeia chegaram a um acordo acerca da proposta para um carregador comum no espaço da união europeia. No Outono de 2024, o USB Tipo C tornar-se-á a porta de carregamento comum para todos os telemóveis. O acordo provisório sobre a directiva alterada relativa ao equipamento de rádio, estabelece uma única solução de carregamento para certos dispositivos electrónicos. Esta lei faz parte de um esforço mais amplo da UE para tornar os produtos na UE mais sustentáveis, para reduzir os resíduos electrónicos, e para facilitar a vida dos consumidores.</p>

<p>De acordo com as novas regras, os consumidores deixarão de precisar de um dispositivo de carregamento e cabo diferente cada vez que comprarem um novo dispositivo, e poderão utilizar um único carregador para todos os seus dispositivos electrónicos portáteis de pequena e média dimensão. Telemóveis, tablets, leitores electrónicos, auriculares, câmaras digitais, auscultadores e auscultadores, consolas de videojogos portáteis e altifalantes portáteis que são recarregáveis através de um cabo com fios terão de ser equipados com uma porta USB tipo C, independentemente do seu fabricante. Os computadores portáteis também terão de ser adaptados aos requisitos até 40 meses após a entrada em vigor.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker e alguns vídeos interessantes.</p>

<p><em>"By autumn 2024, USB Type-C will become the common charging port for all mobile phones, tablets and cameras in the EU, Parliament and Council negotiators agreed today. The provisional agreement on the amended Radio Equipment Directive, establishes a single charging solution for certain electronic devices. This law is a part of a broader EU effort to make products in the EU more sustainable, to reduce electronic waste, and make consumers’ lives easier. Under the new rules, consumers will no longer need a different charging device and cable every time they purchase a new device, and can use one single charger for all of their small and medium-sized portable electronic devices. Mobile phones, tablets, e-readers, earbuds, digital cameras, headphones and headsets, handheld videogame consoles and portable speakers that are rechargeable via a wired cable will have to be equipped with a USB Type-C port, regardless of their manufacturer. Laptops will also have to be adapted to the requirements by 40 months after the entry into force."</em> <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220603IPR32196/deal-on-common-charger-reducing-hassle-for-consumers-and-curbing-e-waste">[...]</a>

The main body of NASA’s Europa Clipper spacecraft has been delivered to the agency’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. Over the next two years there, engineers and technicians will finish assembling the craft by hand before testing it to make sure it can withstand the journey to Jupiter’s icy moon Europa. The spacecraft body is the mission’s workhorse. Standing 10 feet (3 meters) tall and 5 feet (1.5 meters) wide, it’s an aluminum cylinder integrated with electronics, radios, thermal loop tubing, cabling, and the propulsion system. With its solar arrays and other deployable equipment stowed for launch, Europa Clipper will be as large as an SUV; when extended, the solar arrays make the craft the size of a basketball court."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-europa-clipper-mission-completes-main-body-of-the-spacecraft">[...]</a>

<p><em>"When temperatures fall below freezing, cellphones need to be recharged frequently, and electric cars have shorter driving ranges. This is because their lithium-ion batteries’ anodes get sluggish, holding less charge and draining energy quickly. To improve electrical performance in the extreme cold, researchers reporting in ACS Central Science have replaced the traditional graphite anode in a lithium-ion battery with a bumpy carbon-based material, which maintains its rechargeable storage capacity down to -31 F. Lithium-ion batteries are great for powering rechargeable electronics because they can store a lot of energy and have long lifespans. But when temps fall below freezing, these energy sources’ electrical performance declines, and when conditions are cold enough, they can fail to transfer any charge. It’s why some people living in the U.S. Midwest have trouble with their electric cars in the dead of winter, and why it’s risky to use these batteries in space explorations. Recently, scientists determined that the flat orientation of graphite in the anode is responsible for the drop in a lithium-ion battery’s energy storage capacity in the cold."</em> <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/presspacs/2022/acs-presspac-june-8-2022/lithium-ion-batteries-that-last-longer-in-extreme-cold.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=120625">Study Reveals How Some High-Energy Particle 'Jets' Lose Energy</a></h2>

<p><em>"Results may offer new insight into properties of quark-gluon plasma (QGP)—the hot mix of fundamental nuclear-matter building blocks that filled the early universe. Scientists studying particle collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) have revealed how certain particle-jets lose energy as they traverse the unique form of nuclear matter created in these collisions. The results, published in Physical Review C, should help them learn about key “transport properties” of this hot particle soup, known as a quark-gluon plasma (QGP). “By looking at how jets of particles slow down as they move through the QGP, we can learn about its properties the same way studying how objects move through water can tell you something about its density and viscosity,” said Raghav Kunnawalkam Elayavalli, a postdoctoral fellow at Yale University and member of RHIC’s STAR experiment collaboration. But there are multiple ways a jet can lose energy—or be “quenched.” So, it can be hard to tell which of those causes is creating the quenching effect. With the new findings, for the first time, STAR has identified a specific population of jets for which the physicists say they can distinctively identify the mechanism: individual quarks emitting gluons as they interact with the QGP."</em> <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=120625">[...]</a>

<p><em>"QUT researchers have used intersecting light beams to control chemical reactions in an advanced material, paving the way for future use in 3D printers that print entire layers, instead of single points, at a time. QUT’s Centre for Materials Science interdisciplinary research team, made up of Dr Sarah Walden, Leona Rodrigues, Dr Jessica Alves, Associate Professor James Blinco, Dr Vinh Truong, and ARC Laureate Fellow Professor Christopher Barner-Kowollik, have published their research in Nature Communications. Dr Walden said light was a particularly desirable tool for activating chemical processes, because of the precision it offered in starting a reaction. “Most of the work QUT’s Soft Matter Materials Group researchers have done in the past with light has been to use a laser beam to start and stop a chemical reaction along the entire volume where the light strikes the material,” Dr Walden said. “In this case, we have two different coloured light beams, and the reaction only occurs where the two beams intersect. “We use one colour of light to activate one molecule, and the second colour of light to activate another molecule."</em> <a href="https://www.qut.edu.au/news?id=181408">[...]</a>

Superconductors are materials with no electrical resistance whatsoever, commonly requiring extremely low temperatures. They are used in a wide range of domains, from medical applications to a central role in quantum computers. Superconductivity is caused by specially linked pairs of electrons known as Cooper pairs.

<p><em>"Artificial intelligence (AI) plays an important role in many systems, from predictive text to medical diagnoses. Inspired by the human brain, many AI systems are implemented based on artificial neural networks, where electrical equivalents of biological neurons are interconnected, trained with a set of known data, such as images, and then used to recognize or classify new data points. In traditional neural networks used for image recognition, the image of the target object is first formed on an image sensor, such as the digital camera in a smart phone. Then, the image sensor converts light into electrical signals, and ultimately into the binary data, which can then be processed, analyzed, stored and classified using computer chips. Speeding up these abilities is key to improving any number of applications, such as face recognition, automatically detecting text in photos, or helping self-driving cars recognize obstacles. While current, consumer-grade image classification technology on a digital chip can perform billions of computations per second, making it fast enough for most applications, more sophisticated image classification such as identifying moving objects, 3D object identification, or classification of microscopic cells in the body, are pushing the computational limits of even the most powerful technology."</em> <a href="https://blog.seas.upenn.edu/penn-engineers-create-chip-that-can-process-and-classify-nearly-two-billion-images-per-second/">[...]</a>

It has been used in the revolution of cloud communication systems in the field of electronics as it has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth communications capabilities. The microcontroller has several pinouts. In this article, we are going to focus on the 3v3 pin which is where the powering of the ESP8266occurss. This 3V3 means that the ESP8266 is powered by the use of the 3.3V and therefore we need to ensure that before we power this system we are doing it with the right voltages or else we might end up creating more damage."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/simon-mugo/3v3-power-supply-system-for-esp8266-4a0046">[...]</a>

<p><em>"What makes this project special is that we are going to render graphics on a text LCD display which is not supposed to be used this way. Since you cant control any particular pixel, this idea appears to be more of a pipe dream than a realistic plan. And this is why you should try it and push the hardware limits. Spoiler: it will not run DOOM for now, but it will run "Bad Apple"! HARDWARE A character LCD display. The most common is 1602."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Streaming-Video-on-a-Text-LCD-Display-With-Arduino/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Low-cost device for control mosquitoes, weeds, pest etc. This is an innovative and effective method for remote monitoring of mosquitoes and their neutralization. Was explained in detail how was leveraged modern advances in neural networks to use a powerful laser to neutralize mosquitoes. The experimental low-cost prototype for mosquito control uses a powerful laser to thermally neutralize the mosquitoes. The developed device is controlled by a single-board computer based on the neural network and demonstrated experimental research for mosquito neutralization during which, to maximize approximation to natural conditions, simulation of various working conditions was conducted. We showed that a low-cost device can be used to kill mosquitoes with a powerful laser."</em> <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/185652-laser-device-for-neutralizing-mosquitoes">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This radio was made by using TEA5767 module radio. This radio use the radio module TEA5767 which can operate from 76Mhz to 108Mhz. Furthermore, using a spst switch, we can turn on and off the radio and see the frequency chosen on the LCD (this use I2C protocol) by two buttons that change the frequency value. In the last we can change the volume thanks to a potentiometer on an amplificator to whom are connected two speakers and save through the EEPROM the last frequency chosen.

<h2><a href="https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Science-Clock/">Arduino Science Clock</a></h2>

<p><em>"I have toyed with the idea of building a clock for sometime and my sister had a big birthday coming up so I decided that this was a great opportunity to build a clock for her as a gift. My sister has a PhD in science and works as a science educator so I decided to make a science themed clock. I wanted to make the clock slightly different, the first thing that stands out with this clock is that it doesn't have numbers, I used the periodic table elements instead. For those of you that don't know here's a list of the elements I used with there corresponding number H-Hydrogen He-Helium Li-Lithium Be-Beryllium B-Boron C-Carbon N-Nitrogen O-Oxygen F-Fluorine Ne-Neon Na-Sodium Mg-Magnesium So rather than 6 O-Clock it is actually carbon o-clock etc. The clock has both digital and analogue systems for time keeping. The analogue system simply uses two stepper motors for moving the hands in hour or minute steps."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Science-Clock/">[...]</a>
