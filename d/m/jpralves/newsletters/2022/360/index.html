<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1693, o horólogo inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harrison">John Harrison</a>. Ele inventou o primeiro cronómetro marinho prático, que permitiu aos navegadores calcular com precisão a sua longitude no mar. Ele foi levado a iniciar este trabalho após uma enorme recompensa oferecida pelo governo britânico por novos instrumentos de navegação para evitar mais desastres no mar. John Harrison assumiu o estabelecimento científico e académico do seu tempo e ganhou o prémio da longitude através de extraordinária perspicácia mecânica, talento e determinação.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1809, o matemático francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Liouville">Joseph Liouville</a>. Ele descobriu números transcendentais (aqueles que não são as raízes das equações algébricas com coeficientes racionais), e que há infinitamente muitos deles. Também trabalhou em análise real e complexa, teoria dos números e geometria diferencial. O seu nome é recordado na teoria de Sturm-Liouville das equações diferenciais que generaliza as ideias de Joseph Fourier, e são importantes na física matemática. Ele estudou mecânica celestial. Liouville fundou em 1836, e editou durante quase quatro décadas, o Journal de Mathématique, que continua a ser uma importante publicação matemática francesa. Editou e publicou (1843) os manuscritos deixados para trás após a morte prematura de Evariste Galois 22 anos antes.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1820, o físico francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmond_Becquerel">Edmond Becquerel</a>. Ele era filho do químico Antoine-César Becquerel e pai do físico Henri Becquerel (que descobriu a radioactividade). O seu próprio trabalho experimental foi feito em electricidade, ótica e magnetismo. Mediu as propriedades das correntes eléctricas, como estas surgem, e descobriu (1840) correntes eléctricas em certas reacções químicas iniciadas pela luz. Estudou o diamagnetismo (1845-46). Em 1855, descobriu que o simples deslocamento de um condutor metálico num líquido produziria alguma corrente eléctrica. Inventou o fosforoscópio para medir a curta duração da fosforescência dos materiais após exposição à luz brilhante, e foi também capaz de examinar o espectro da luz que emanava dos corpos luminescentes.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1835, o físico austríaco <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Stefan">Josef Stefan</a>. Ele propôs uma lei de radiação (1879) afirmando que a quantidade de energia radiada por segundo de um corpo negro é proporcional à quarta potência da sua temperatura absoluta. (Um corpo negro é um objecto teórico que absorve toda a radiação que cai sobre ele). Esta lei é conhecida como a lei de Stefan ou a lei de Stefan-Bolzmann. Ele também estudou a electricidade, a teoria cinética dos gases e a hidrodinâmica.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1884, o químico físico holandês-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Debye">Peter Debye</a>. Ele recebeu o Prémio Nobel da Química de 1936 pelas suas investigações de momentos dipolo, raios X, e dispersão de luz em gases. A maior parte do seu trabalho foi em química-física com especial interesse na análise de electrólitos e de momentos dipolares. Ele estabeleceu uma teoria de calor específico com algumas melhorias em relação à proposta por Einstein. Debye realizou um trabalho importante na análise de pós cristalinos utilizando técnicas de difracção de raios X. Ele também determinou as dimensões das moléculas gasosas e as distâncias interatómicas usando raios X.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1893, o astrónomo germano-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Baade">Walter Baade</a>. Ele, com Fritz Zwicky, propôs que as supernovas pudessem produzir raios cósmicos e estrelas de neutrões (1934), e Baade fez extensos estudos sobre a Nebulosa do Caranguejo e a sua estrela central. Durante os apagões da II Guerra Mundial na área de Los Angeles, Baade utilizou pela primeira vez o telescópio Hooker de 100 polegadas para resolver estrelas na região central da Galáxia de Andrómeda. Isto levou à sua definição de duas populações estelares, à percepção de que existiam dois tipos de estrelas variáveis do Cepheid, e a partir daí a uma duplicação da escala assumida do universo. Baade e Rudolph Minkowski identificaram e tomaram espectrogramas de contrapartidas ópticas de muitas das primeiras fontes de rádio descobertas, incluindo Cygnus A e Cassiopeia A.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1903, o bioquímico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Butenandt">Adolf Butenandt</a>. Ele recebeu (com Leopold Ruzicka) o Prémio Nobel da Química de 1939 pelo trabalho pioneiro (1929-34) sobre as hormonas sexuais, principalmente o isolamento do estrone (uma hormona que influencia o desenvolvimento do tracto reprodutivo feminino). Embora forçado pelo governo nazi a recusar o prémio, pôde aceitar a honra em 1949.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1917, o bioquímico inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kendrew">John Kendrew</a>. Ele partilhou o Prémio Nobel da Química de 1962 (com o colega Max Ferdinand Perutz) "pelos seus estudos sobre as estruturas das proteínas globulares". Perutz tinha determinado a estrutura da hemoglobina. Kendrew determinou a estrutura da mioglobina da proteína muscular, que armazena oxigénio e o dá às células musculares quando necessário.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1941, o radioastrónomo e físico americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Hooton_Taylor_Jr.">Joseph Hooton Taylor Jr.</a>. Ele partilhou (com Russell A. Hulse) o Prémio Nobel da Física de 1993 pela sua descoberta conjunta do primeiro pulsar binário (1974). Este fenómeno único, duas estrelas orbitando-se uma à outra - uma delas emitindo regularmente "bipes" de radiofrequência - tem sido importante como campo de prova do espaço profundo para a teoria geral da relatividade de Einstein. O seu grupo de investigação em Princeton utilizou o radiotelescópio de 1000 pés em Arecibo, Porto Rico, o maior e mais sensível do mundo para captar ondas de rádio do espaço.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou foi lançada a versão 5.17 do Kernel de Linux. Chega uma semana mais tarde do que inicialmente previsto, e apresenta uma grande colecção de alterações, melhorias, melhorias de desempenho, e todas as correcções de segurança importantes. Entre as características do kernel do Linux 5.17 está um novo driver AMD P-State (para hardware compatível, ou seja, Zen 2 e mais recente, basicamente). Foi introduzido o Universal Stylus Initiative (USI), suporte para varios teclados Apple Magic 2021 e para dispositivos NZXT. OS filesystems BTRFS e EXT4 ganharam desempenho e ainda foram acrescentados suporte de sanitização para o ARM64, suporte de virtualização KVM para o Intel AMX e suporte virtual Xen USB para guests Xen. Finalmente foi adicionado suporte para o PFRUT (platform firmware runtime update) que permitirá fazer updates de firmware de alguns dispositivos sem reiniciar o sistema.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker e alguns vídeos interessantes. É apresentado o livro "ANALOG SEEKrets" e a revista Hackspace Magazine nº53 de Abril.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2022/03/linux-5-17-released-new-features">Linux Kernel 5.17 Released, This is What’s News</a></h2>

<p><em>"Linux 5.17 arrives a week later than initially planned, and features a canny crop of changes, improvements, performance enhancements, and all-important security fixes. Linus Torvalds, announcing the release on the Linux Kernel Mailing List, says the one-week delay (to account for lately-revealed security issues) meant “…we did get a few last-minute reverts and fixes in and avoid some brown-paper bugs that would otherwise have been stable fodder, so it’s all good.” So what’s new? Linux Kernel 5.17 Features Chief among the features baked in to the Linux 5.17 kernel is a new AMD P-State driver (for compatible hardware, i.e. Zen 2 and newer, basically). Valve is said to have helped in the creation of this driver (thanks to Steam Deck handheld gaming PC) and it promises to offer better power efficiency than the standard ACPI CPUFreq driver. There is, as always, a fresh dollop of support fornext-generation processors from both AMD and Intel, as well as enablement work to support Intel’s upcoming Alchemist graphics cards."</em> <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2022/03/linux-5-17-released-new-features">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The rover’s self-driving capabilities will be put to the test this month as it begins a record-breaking series of sprints to its next sampling location. NASA’s Perseverance Mars rover is trying to cover more distance in a single month than any rover before it – and it’s doing so using artificial intelligence. On the path ahead are sandpits, craters, and fields of sharp rocks that the rover will have to navigate around on its own. At the end of the 3-mile (5-kilometer) journey, which began March 14, 2022, Perseverance will reach an ancient river delta within Jezero Crater, where a lake existed billions of years ago. This delta is one of the best locations on Mars for the rover to look for signs of past microscopic life. Using a drill on the end of its robotic arm and a complex sample collection system in its belly, Perseverance is collecting rock cores for return to Earth – the first part of the Mars Sample Return campaign."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-perseverance-rover-hightails-it-to-martian-delta">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Nexperia, the expert in essential semiconductors, today announced the release of new, enhanced Electrothermal models for its MOSFET devices. Semiconductor manufacturers commonly provide simulation models for their MOSFETs, but these usually only include a limited number of device parameters which have been modelled at typical operating temperatures. Nexperia’s new advanced models capture the thermal interdependency of the complete set of device parameters right across the full operating temperature range from -55 °C to 175 °C. Overall accuracy is further enhanced by the inclusion of reverse diode recovery time and device electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) performance in these advanced models. These enable engineers to create accurate circuit and system level simulations and assess the electrical, thermal and EMC performance before committing to build a prototype. These models also help save time and resources because engineers, who were previously required to ensure that their designs could operate under (unlikely) worst-case conditions, can now simulate their designs across specific temperatures ranges."</em> <a href="https://www.nexperia.com/about/news-events/press-releases/Advanced-Electrothermal-models-from-Nexperia-cover-entire-MOSFET-operating-temperature-range.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/opinion/new-specification-hyperscale-virtualization.html">A New Specification for Hyperscale Virtualization</a></h2>

<p><em>"Today, Intel contributed the Scalable I/O Virtualization (SIOV) specification to the Open Compute Project (OCP) with Microsoft, enabling device and platform manufacturers access to an industry standard specification for hyperscale virtualization of PCI Express and Compute Express Link devices in cloud servers. When adopted, SIOV architecture will enable data center operators to deliver more cost-effective access to high-performance accelerators and other key I/O devices for their customers, as well as relieve I/O device manufacturers of cost and programming burdens imposed under previous standards. The new SIOV specification is a modernized hardware and software architecture that enables efficient, mass-scale virtualization of I/O devices, and overcomes the scaling limitations of prior I/O virtualization technologies. Under the terms of the OCP contribution, any company can adopt SIOV technology and incorporate it into their products under an open, zero-cost license. In cloud environments, I/O devices including network adaptors, GPUs and storage controllers are shared among many virtualized workloads requiring their services. Hardware-assisted I/O virtualization technologies enable efficient routing of I/O traffic from the workloads through the virtualization software stack to the devices."</em> <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/opinion/new-specification-hyperscale-virtualization.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4432.html">STMicroelectronics reveals 2.5V rad-hard digital-to-analog converter for next-generation satellite applications</a></h2>

<p><em>"The STMicroelectronics RHRDAC121 radiation-hardened digital-to-analog converter (DAC) operates down to 2.5V for use in modern, low-power system designs that older 3.3V parts cannot support. Consuming just 0.6mW at its maximum speed and supply voltage, the 12-bit 1Msps successive-approximation register (SAR) DAC helps reduce size, weight, and power (SWaP) in next-generation satellites. Typically used in circuits for telemetry, housekeeping, and precision sensor-gain adjustment, its features include an SPI-compatible serial output, internal voltage reference, and automatic power-on-reset to zero-volt output. These ensure high precision with minimal external components, saving circuit complexity and board area. Maintaining stable performance parameters in harsh conditions up to 100krad(Si) total ionizing dose (TID), the RHRDAC121 is single-event latch-up (SEL) -free up to 125MeV.cm²/mg. It is characterized for single-event transient (SET) and single-event upset (SEU) and ready for immediate deployment with no further up-screening required."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4432.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/international-sea-level-satellite-takes-over-from-predecessor">International Sea Level Satellite Takes Over From Predecessor</a></h2>

<p><em>"Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich, the newest addition to a long line of ocean-monitoring satellites, becomes the reference satellite for sea level measurements. On March 22, the newest U.S.-European sea level satellite, named Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich, became the official reference satellite for global sea level measurements. This means that sea surface height data collected by other satellites will be compared to the information produced by Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich to ensure their accuracy.

A team, led by A/Prof. Lawrence Lee of UNSW Medicine &amp; Health’s EMBL Australia Node in Single Molecule Science, reports how they designed and built rapid exchange molecular machines with stability in the journal ACS Nano. “We adopted a synthetic biology approach to this problem by constructing an artificial nanoscopic machine using DNA and protein components."</em> <a href="https://med.unsw.edu.au/news-events/news/autonomous-nanomachines-inspired-nature">[...]</a>

<p><em>"It’s fairly reasonable to assume that an encrypted email can’t be seen by prying eyes. That’s because in order to break through most of the encryption systems we use on a day-to-day basis, unless you are the intended recipient, you’d need the answer to a mathematical problem that’s nearly impossible for a computer to solve in a reasonable amount of time. Nearly impossible for modern-day computers, at least. “If quantum computing becomes a reality, however, some of those problems are not hard anymore,” said Shantanu Chakrabartty, the Clifford W. Murphy Professor and vice dean for research and graduate education in the Preston M. Green Department of Electrical &amp; Systems Engineering at the McKelvey School of Engineering. Already these new computing paradigms are becoming a reality and could soon be deployable.

<p><em>"Researchers from the Basque Nanoscience Research Center CIC nanoGUNE (San Sebastian, Spain), in collaboration with POLYMAT (San Sebastian, Spain), the Institute of Physics of the Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg and the Max Planck Institute of Microstructure Physics (both in Halle, Germany) demonstrate the all-electrical generation, manipulation, and detection of spin polarization in chiral single-crystalline Tellurium nanowires. The results, published in Nature Materials (DOI: 10.1038/s41563-022-01211-7), pave the way for the development of magnet-free chirality-based spintronic devices. Chiral materials are an ideal playground for exploring the relation between symmetry, relativistic effects, and electronic transport. For instance, chiral organic molecules have been intensively studied to electrically generate spin-polarized currents in the last decade, but their poor electronic conductivity limits their potential for applications. Conversely, chiral inorganic materials such as Tellurium have excellent electrical conductivity, but their potential for enabling the electrical control of spin polarization in devices remains unclear. In this recently publish work, it was shown that the orientation of the electrically generated spin polarization is determined by the nanowire handedness and uniquely follows the current direction, while its magnitude can be manipulated by an electrostatic gate."</em> <a href="https://www.nanogune.eu/en/research/nanodevices/news/magnet-free-chiral-nanowires-spintronic-devices">[...]</a>

The particles are accumulated on the roadsides and then run off into watercourses where they pollute the water ecosystem. Whilst the amount of pollution from larger microplastics is known, there has been a technological gap in the detection and analysis of the fraction of these smaller particles.

<p><em>"A team of experts at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Ames Laboratory has released a new open-source software program called Rxn Rover. It is designed to help chemistry researchers easily and affordably tap into the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) to automate chemical reaction optimization and discovery, speeding the discovery and deployment of new technologies. Process automation is not new, and chemical industries have made big leaps in the last decade using machine learning to aid the discovery and optimization of new chemical reactions and compounds, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry. But the software and hardware systems used to accomplish these tasks are often extremely specialized, expensive, and frequently out of reach for many academic research groups and small R&amp;D labs. “People know that AI is the future, but there is a big gap between that and figuring out how to execute it in fundamental and even applied research,” said Long Qi, a scientist in the Division of Chemical and Biological Sciences at Ames Lab. “We developed Rxn Rover to attempt to bridge that gap, by providing an inexpensive, open-source, highly adaptable way to discover and optimize chemical reactions.” Kevin Basemann, previously a graduate student at Ames Laboratory and Iowa State University, and now a postdoctoral research associate at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, pitched the idea to couple AI with a chemical reactor to automate reactions."</em> <a href="https://www.ameslab.gov/news/rxn-rover-software-helps-small-chem-labs-easily-access-ai-for-reaction-optimization">[...]</a>

<p><em>"One day, the demand for electricity to charge electric vehicles may overwhelm the power grid, unless the electricity sector is prepared for the challenge. With a growing fleet of EVs on the road, grid planners depend on accurate estimates of charging patterns to calculate electricity demand. A team of researchers at Stanford University assembled a scalable probabilistic model for charging demand that can be applied to a flexible array of populations and account for a wide range of factors. Within California, the model found that by 2030 – in a scenario where most EV owners opt to charge their vehicles when they get home every evening – peak charging demand would be more than twice as high as if drivers charged throughout the day at home, work and public stations. By 2030, EV charging will comprise a significant proportion of electricity demand in advanced economies, so keeping peak demand as low as possible would curb the need for new generators and transmission lines. “We wanted to create a model framework for long-term planning that captures real drivers’ charging patterns and accounts for uncertainty,” said Ram Rajagopal, senior author of the study, which was published in the March 1 edition of Applied Energy, Rajagopal is an associate professor in Stanford’s Department of Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering."</em> <a href="https://energy.stanford.edu/news/how-predict-and-manage-ev-growth-keep-electricity-grids-reliable-and-affordable">[...]</a>

Instead of storing data in RAM (random-access memory), it was stored in a 1024-position shift register. You put a bit into the shift register and 1024 clock cycles later, the bit pops out the other end. Since a shift-register memory didn't require addressing circuitry, it could be manufactured more cheaply than a random-access memory chip.1 The downside, of course, is that you had to use bits as they became available, rather than access arbitrary memory locations.

<p><em>"In this project you will be going to decode the signal sent by any type of Remote to make Projects Introduction In this project I will show you how to Decode IR Remote Control Signals' of any Remote using Arduino. The remotes which we use in our home are basically made of IR transmissions for example TV remote, DVD remote, Sound System remote etc. But these signals never interfere with each other because every key in the remote control has unique operation code in Hexadecimal format. By decoding these signals we can know what is the unique code of the key. By knowing the codes we can implement several applications where we can control with same remote. Working on Basics IR remote has a button and a microcontroller with IR LED attached."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/agarwalkrishna3009/decode-ir-remote-control-signals-of-any-remote-using-arduino-ee1595">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The project presented here is a differential output amplifier that converts a single-ended audio signal input to a balanced output pair. This balanced audio project consists of high-performance OPAMPS with on-chip precision resistors. They are fully specified for high-performance audio applications and have excellent AC specifications, including low distortion (0.0005% at 1 kHz) and high slew rate (15 V/µs). The board is based on DRV135 from Texas Instruments. The on-chip resistors are laser-trimmed for accurate gain and optimum output common-mode rejection. Wide output voltage swing and high output drive capability allow use in a wide variety of demanding applications."</em> <a href="https://www.electronics-lab.com/project/audio-line-driver-using-drv135-with-balanced-output/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This plugin intends to enable direct generation of toolpaths from physical line following. This is illustrated in this. This could be useful in cases where the object is not originating from a CAD drawing, but is coming from a physical object, like cutting a piece to fit into an existing odd-shaped hole. Installation This has only been tested on OctoPi. It has only been tested with the latest version of OctoPrint. It might work on earlier versions based on Python 3, but the odds are low that it would work on Python 2."</em> <a href="https://github.com/vector76/CameraTracer">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This project is adapted from the staggeringly popular Make: Electronics Third Edition, which has been completely re-re-written with most photos and schematics replaced and updated! During 2021 I started writing a third edition of my book Make: Electronics. One of the pleasures of this task was that I could rethink all the circuits, and with the benefit of hindsight, I saw how to simplify one project in particular: The intrusion alarm. You’d think an alarm should be easy enough. Just place some sensors on doors and windows, wire them to a beeper, and — job done! But it’s not so simple."</em> <a href="https://makezine.com/projects/build-this-intruder-alarm-two-ways-using-555-timers-or-a-raspberry-pi/">[...]</a>
