<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1803, o matemático francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Charles_Fran%C3%A7ois_Sturm">Jacques Charles-François Sturm</a>. Ele é responsável pelo teorema de Sturm, uma importante contribuição para a teoria das equações. Enquanto tutor da família de Broglie em Paris (1823-24), Sturm conheceu muitos dos principais cientistas e matemáticos franceses. Em 1826, com o engenheiro suíço Daniel Colladon, ele fez a primeira determinação precisa da velocidade do som na água. Um ano mais tarde escreveu um ensaio premiado sobre fluidos compressíveis. Desde a época de René Descartes, existia o problema de encontrar o número de soluções de uma dada equação diferencial de segunda ordem dentro de um determinado intervalo da variável. Sturm forneceu uma solução completa para o problema com o seu teorema que apareceu pela primeira vez em Mémoire sur la résolution des équations numériques (1829; "Tratado sobre Equações Numéricas"). Estes princípios foram aplicados no desenvolvimento da mecânica quântica, como na solução da equação de Schrödinger e dos seus valores-limite.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1899, o inventor húngaro-argentino <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_B%C3%ADr%C3%B3">László Bíró</a>. Ele patenteou a primeira esferográfica moderna comercialmente bem sucedida. A primeira esferográfica tinha sido inventada aproximadamente 50 anos antes por John J. Loud, mas não foi um sucesso comercial.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1901, o físico ítalo-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a>. Ele recebeu o Prémio Nobel da Física em 1938 como um dos principais arquitectos da era nuclear. Foi o último dos físicos de dupla ameaça: um génio na criação tanto de teorias esotéricas como de experiências elegantes. Em 1933, desenvolveu a teoria do decaimento beta, postulando que o recém-descoberto decaimento de neutrões a um protão emite um electrão e uma partícula a que chamou um neutrino. O desenvolvimento da teoria para explicar este decaimento resultou mais tarde na descoberta da fraca força de interacção. Ele desenvolveu as estatísticas matemáticas necessárias para esclarecer uma grande classe de fenómenos subatómicos, descobriu a radioactividade induzida por neutrões, e dirigiu a primeira reacção em cadeia controlada envolvendo a fissão nuclear.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1920, o químico britânico <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_D._Mitchell">Peter D. Mitchell</a>. Ele recebeu o Prémio Nobel da Química de 1978 por ajudar a esclarecer como o ADP (adenosina difosfato) é convertido no composto energético ATP (adenosina trifosfato) nas mitocôndrias das células vivas.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1925, o engenheiro e inventor norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_MacCready">Paul MacCready</a>. Ele inventou não só as primeiras máquinas voadoras movidas a energia humana, mas também as primeiras aeronaves movidas a energia solar a fazer voos sustentados. A 23 de Agosto de 1977, o avião movido a pedal, o Gossamer Condor, voou com sucesso uma rota de 1,15 milhas em número de 8 para demonstrar um voo sustentado e manobrável, pelo qual ganhou o Prémio Kremer de 50.000 libras (95.000 dólares). MacCready desenhou o Condor com o Dr. Peter Lissamen. A sua estrutura era feita de tubos finos de alumínio, cobertos com plástico mylar apoiado com fio de aço inoxidável. Em 1979, o Gossamer Albatross ganhou o segundo Prémio Kremer por ter feito um voo através do Canal da Mancha.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1931, o físico de partículas norte-americano <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Watson_Cronin">James Watson Cronin</a>. Ele partilhou (com Val Logsdon Fitch) o Prémio Nobel da Física de 1980 pela "descoberta de violações dos princípios de simetria fundamental na decadência dos K-mesons neutros". A sua experiência provou que uma reacção inversa não segue o caminho da reacção original, o que implicava que o tempo tem um efeito sobre as interacções subatómicas de partículas. Assim, a experiência demonstrou uma quebra na simetria partícula-antipartícula para certas reacções de partículas subatómicas.</p>

<p>Faz hoje 68 que era fundada a Organização Europeia para a Investigação Nuclear, mais conhecida por CERN (derivado do nome Conseil européen pour la recherche nucléaire). Foi inicialmente constituido por 12 membros fundadores: Bélgica, Dinamarca, França, República Federal da Alemanha, Grécia, Itália, Países Baixos, Noruega, Suécia, Suíça, Reino Unido, e Jugoslávia. Actualmente tem 23 membros e das descobertas feitas por esta organização destacam-se a descoberta de correntes neutras na câmara da bolha da Gargamelle em 1973, a descoberta dos bósons W e Z nas experiências dos UA1 e UA2 em 1983, a determinação do número de famílias de neutrinos leves no Large Electron-Positron Collider (LEP) a operar no pico do bosão Z em 1989, a primeira criação de átomos anti-hidrogénio na experiência PS210 em 1995, a descoberta da violação directa da CP na experiência NA48 em 1999, o Programa Heavy Ion descobriu um novo estado da matéria, o Plasma Quark Gluon em 2000, o isolamento de 38 átomos de anti-hidrogénio em 2010, a Manutenção de anti-hidrogénio durante mais de 15 minutos em 2011, e um bóson com uma massa de cerca de 125 GeV/c2 consistente com o bóson de Higgs, há muito procurado em 2012. É também de realçar que o projecto da World Wide Web foi incubado no CERN.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou, a NASA fez colidir a sonda DART contra um asteroide. Após 10 meses de voo no espaço, o Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) da NASA - a primeira demonstração mundial de tecnologia de defesa planetária - teve um impacto bem sucedido no seu alvo asteróide, a primeira tentativa da agência para mover um asteróide no espaço.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker e alguns vídeos interessantes. É apresentada a revista MagPI nº 122 de Outubro e o livro "Contribute To Open Source: The Right Way 3Rd Edition".</p>

<p><em>"After 10 months flying in space, NASA’s Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) – the world’s first planetary defense technology demonstration – successfully impacted its asteroid target on Monday, the agency’s first attempt to move an asteroid in space. Mission control at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland, announced the successful impact at 7:14 p.m. EDT. As a part of NASA’s overall planetary defense strategy, DART’s impact with the asteroid Dimorphos demonstrates a viable mitigation technique for protecting the planet from an Earth-bound asteroid or comet, if one were discovered. “At its core, DART represents an unprecedented success for planetary defense, but it is also a mission of unity with a real benefit for all humanity,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. “As NASA studies the cosmos and our home planet, we’re also working to protect that home, and this international collaboration turned science fiction into science fact, demonstrating one way to protect Earth.” DART targeted the asteroid moonlet Dimorphos, a small body just 530 feet (160 meters) in diameter. It orbits a larger, 2,560-foot (780-meter) asteroid called Didymos."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-dart-mission-hits-asteroid-in-first-ever-planetary-defense-test">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Observations from the spacecraft’s pass of the moon provided the first close-up in over two decades of this ocean world, resulting in remarkable imagery and unique science. The first picture NASA’s Juno spacecraft took as it flew by Jupiter’s ice-encrusted moon Europa has arrived on Earth. Revealing surface features in a region near the moon’s equator called Annwn Regio, the image was captured during the solar-powered spacecraft’s closest approach, on Thursday, Sept. 29, at 2:36 a.m. PDT (5:36 a.m. EDT), at a distance of about 219 miles (352 kilometers). This is only the third close pass in history below 310 miles (500 kilometers) altitude and the closest look any spacecraft has provided at Europa since Jan. 3, 2000, when NASA’s Galileo came within 218 miles (351 kilometers) of the surface. Europa is the sixth-largest moon in the solar system, slightly smaller than Earth’s moon. Scientists think a salty ocean lies below a miles-thick ice shell, sparking questions about potential conditions capable of supporting life underneath Europa’s surface."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-juno-shares-first-image-from-flyby-of-jupiters-moon-europa">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.global.toshiba/ww/technology/corporate/rdc/rd/topics/22/2209-02.html">Toshiba Boosts Transparent Cu2O Tandem Solar Cell to A New High</a></h2>

<p><em>"Researchers at Japan’s Toshiba Corporation (TOKYO: 6502) have announced a significant advance in their work to develop an efficient, low cost and highly reliable tandem solar cell that raises the output of solar panels by layering a transparent solar cell over a standard silicon cell. Building on their achievements to date, the researchers have reported a transparent cuprous oxide (Cu2O) solar cell with a conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.5%, the highest level yet achieved for a Cu2O cell (*1). This was realized by enlarging its predecessor, announced in December 2021, and points to the potential for mass production. The new cell is expected to provide a boost for the development of EV that do not require plug-in charging, and to advance other mobility applications, such as high-altitude platform stations, telecom platforms in the stratosphere. Worldwide promotion of renewables as a mainstream energy supply, and of efforts to electrify transportation, is creating opportunities for solar cells. Toshiba is committed to using its technological capabilities to advance carbon neutrality, and as part of this is developing highly efficient and reliable low cost tandem solar cells that can be mounted on vehicles and trains, which offer only limited installation space."</em> <a href="https://www.global.toshiba/ww/technology/corporate/rdc/rd/topics/22/2209-02.html">[...]</a>

The fully integrated environment supports co-simulation, debug and trace, high-speed simulation and distributed processing software over multiple SoCs (System-on-Chips) and MCUs (Microcontrollers)—all without the need for actual hardware. This software development environment recognizes the automotive industry’s shift toward “Software First” product development, in which a vehicle’s value is increasingly defined by its software, as well as the “Shift Left” software design approach, which emphasizes software verification and validation earlier in the development cycle, before hardware is available. The first development environment tools are available now for the- R-Car S4 and RH850/U2A devices. “Renesas is committed to providing a development environment that helps our automotive customers realize their vision for Software First, while continuing to support their evolution toward Shift Left software development," said Hirofumi Kawaguchi, Vice President of Renesas' Automotive Software Development Division. “We are confident that this development environment will help our customers transform their E/E architecture and facilitate the early development of ECUs and new products, and ultimately deliver more value.” Integrated Development Environment for ECU Development with Multi-Device Configuration Renesas’ integrated development environment with multi-device support enables software development at the ECU level, adding additional value in vehicles and contributing to the Software First approach."</em> <a href="https://www.renesas.com/eu/en/about/press-room/renesas-launches-integrated-development-environment-enables-ecu-level-automotive-software">[...]</a>

<p><em>"STMicroelectronics has added the TSV782 high-performance dual op amp to its 5V family, with 30MHz gain bandwidth (GBW) and 50µV (typical) input offset voltage for high-speed, high-accuracy signal conditioning. Able to function with a supply as low as 2.0V, the TSV782 can operate from a deeply discharged battery and so extend the runtime of equipment such as smoke alarms. In addition, the operating current of just 3.3mA/channel helps designers maximize the application energy budget to power richer functions and capabilities such as innovative smart features and wireless connectivity. Operating down to 2.0V also lets the op amp use the same power rail as low-voltage logic devices to simplify system design and lower the bill of materials. With rail-to-rail input and output and maximum slew rate of 20V/µs, the TSV782 joins similar rail-to-rail devices in ST’s high-performance family. These include the TSV772, which has GBW of 20MHz and maximum slew rate 13V/µs, and the 50MHz TSV792 that operates at 5.5mA per channel."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4484.html">[...]</a>

Researchers at The University of Texas at Austin are tackling two of the bigger challenges facing electric vehicles: limited range and slow recharging. The researchers fabricated a new type of electrode for lithium-ion batteries that could unleash greater power and faster charging. They did this by creating thicker electrodes – the positively and negatively charged parts of the battery that deliver power to a device – using magnets to create a unique alignment that sidesteps common problems associated with sizing up these critical components. The result is an electrode that could potentially facilitate twice the range on a single charge for an electric vehicle, compared with a battery using an existing commercial electrode. “Two-dimensional materials are commonly believed as a promising candidate for high-rate energy storage applications because it only needs to be several nanometers thick for rapid charge transport,” said Guihua Yu, a professor in UT Austin’s Walker Department of Mechanical Engineering and Texas Materials Institute."</em> <a href="https://news.utexas.edu/2022/09/26/magnetic-field-helps-thick-battery-electrodes-tackle-electric-vehicle-challenges/">[...]</a>

In my early-career research project, our scientific visualization team at Los Alamos National Laboratory wanted to develop algorithms to automatically improve the color maps underlying the images and movies that make data—numbers—easy to understand and interpret at a glance. Our minds have trouble digging meaning out of arrays of digits, but we can quickly spot patterns and trends when those numbers are converted to pictures, with colors representing different values in the data.

This new state-of-the-art technology could help accelerate turbine combustion research aimed at developing engines and aviation fuels that are more environmentally friendly. “This approach, which we call chemical species tomography, provides real-time spatially resolved information for carbon dioxide emissions from a large-scale commercial engine,” said research team leader Michael Lengden from the University of Strathclyde in the U.K. “This information has not been available before at this industrial scale and is a big improvement over the current industry-standard emissions measurement, which involves taking gas from the exhaust to a gas analyzer system in a different location.” The researchers report the new research in the Optica Publishing Group journal Applied Optics. Chemical species tomography works much like the X-ray-based CT scans used in medicine, except that it uses near-infrared laser light tuned to the absorption wavelength of a target molecule and requires very fast imaging speeds to capture the dynamic processes of combustion. “The aviation industry is a major contributor to global carbon dioxide emissions so there is a need for turbine and fuel technologies to improve radically,” said Lengden. “By providing fully validated emissions measurements, our new method could help the industry develop new technology that reduces the environmental impact of aviation.” Imaging emissions from airplane engines Until now it has been impossible to image turbine combustion on test rigs containing a large airplane engine."</em> <a href="https://www.optica.org/en-us/about/newsroom/news_releases/2022/september/researchers_capture_first_images_of_carbon_dioxide/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Due to their very high efficiency in transporting electric charges from light, perovskites are known as the next generation material for solar panels and LED displays. We now have invented a brand-new application of perovskites as optical fibres. The results are published in Science Advances. Optical fibres are tiny wires as thin as a human hair, in which light travels at a superfast speed – 100 times faster than electrons in cables. These tiny optical fibres transmit the majority of our internet data.

<p><em>"Researchers in quantum technology at Chalmers University of Technology have succeeded in developing a technique to control quantum states of light in a three-dimensional cavity. In addition to creating previously known states, the researchers are the first ever to demonstrate the long-sought cubic phase state. The breakthrough is an important step towards efficient error correction in quantum computers. “We have shown that our technology is on par with the best in the world,” says Simone Gasparinetti, who is head of a research group in experimental quantum physics at Chalmers and one of the study’s senior authors. Just as a conventional computer is based on bits that can take the value 0 or 1, the most common method of building a quantum computer uses a similar approach. Quantum mechanical systems with two different quantum states, known as quantum bits (qubits), are used as building blocks."</em> <a href="https://news.cision.com/chalmers/r/quantum-technology-reaches-unprecedented-control-over-captured-light,c3635683">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Computers that can make use of the "spooky" properties of quantum mechanics to solve problems faster than current technology may sound alluring, but first they must overcome a massive disadvantage. Scientists from Japan may have found the answer through their demonstration of how a superconducting material, niobium nitride, can be added to a nitride-semiconductor substrate as a flat, crystalline layer. This process may lead to the easy manufacturing of quantum qubits connected with conventional computer devices. The processes used to manufacture conventional silicon microprocessors have matured over decades and are constantly being refined and improved. In contrast, most quantum computing architectures must be designed mostly from scratch. However, finding a way to add quantum capabilities to existing fabrication lines, or even integrate quantum and conventional logic units in a single chip, might be able to vastly accelerate the adoption of these new systems."</em> <a href="https://www.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/news/3984/">[...]</a>

They also showed that depending on the light used, the metasurface would generate a holographic image or a structural-color nanoprinting image with or without polarization-dependent watermarks. “Our tiny metasurface could be easily attached to currency, ID cards, credit cards, certificates, watches or rings for anticounterfeiting,” said Dai."</em> <a href="https://www.optica.org/en-us/about/newsroom/news_releases/2022/september/metasurface_engineered_to_create_three_different_i/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Physicists at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) have proposed the source of the sudden and puzzling collapse of heat that precedes disruptions that can damage doughnut-shaped tokamak fusion facilities. Coping with the source could overcome one of the most critical challenges that future fusion facilities will face and bring closer to reality the production on Earth of the fusion energy that drives the sun and stars. Researchers traced the collapse to the 3D disordering of the strong magnetic fields that bottle up the hot, charged plasma gas that fuels the reactions. “We proposed a novel way to understand the [disordered] field lines, which was usually ignored or poorly modeled in the previous studies,” said Min-Gu Yoo, a post-doctoral researcher at PPPL and lead author of a Physics of Plasmas paper selected as an editor’s pick together with a figure placed on the cover of the July issue. Yoo has since become a staff scientist at General Atomics in San Diego.

<p><em>"A rooftop tomato plant monitoring system powered by SenseCap K1100 kit is presented in this project. Due to the crisis of agriculture land, it very much important to think about rooftop gardening for food security. Regular maintenance is important for any type of garden. We do rooftop gardening as a hobby. Many of us do not know how to take proper care of the garden. An automated system that can help us in our rooftop gardening, is presented throughout this project."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/banglarbot/rooftop-tomato-plant-monitoring-system-846b7d">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Using 2 ultrasonic sensors to detect the strum motion. And using 3 buttons to play the node The project started with using an ultrasonic sensor to detect distances. Then I thought of using two ultrasonic sensors to tell the passing object‘s movement direction by detecting the change in the measured distance between two sensors. During the testing, the hand wave I used for testing, reminds me of guitar strumming. So I thought of using this to make an air guitar. I mean who can say no to air guitars."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/dmqlkig/breadboard-air-guitar-f70b80">[...]</a>

<p><em>"An automatic suspension adjustment on a bicycle that able to understand the character of the terrain and the activities of the rider. In this project we use data from the motion sensor on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense which is mounted on a bike’s suspension and used under different road conditions. The data was cut into 5 seconds and labeled according to the surface variation and activities. Then processed in Edge Impulse Studio through Neural Network blocks: Spectral Analysis (x, y, z acc) and Classification (Keras) which will produce an ML model that can detect 5 road surface characters and rider activity output (idle, medium, rough, smooth, sprint). The model is deployed into the program on the Nano 33 BLE Sense which has an angle servo motor installed that can adjust the bike’s suspension knob. In the end, this project succeeded in implementing a "smart" system on the bike's suspension which can automatically adjust the level of travel on the suspension (lock, medium, open) according to the character of the road and the activities."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/jallsonsuryo/smart-bike-suspension-7da023">[...]</a>

Let's build this project to get more out of the ancient 0.96" led Required Elements: 1) Image file of QR 2) Arduino Nano 3) OLED display 4) 9V battery 5) PCB shield from PCBWAY In this tutorial, we will build a project with OLED to display different images/ QR using Arduino. Using this you can display any static image on the screen. First, we will modify the image using photo editor and then convert into Arduino compatible hex code. Which then required to light up the single pixel accordingly to the code. The same approach can be used to run a video on this display, which we will try to cover soon."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/OLED-Is-My-New-Picture-Gallery/">[...]</a>
