<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1792, o relojoeiro e inventor norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_Davis">Phineas Davis</a>. Ele virou das suas capacidades de autodidata de fazer jóias e relógios para inventar a primeira locomotiva a carvão bem sucedida construída nos E.U.A. Anteriormente, os caminhos-de-ferro utilizavam locomotivas importadas. A 4 de Janeiro de 1831, a Baltimore e a Ohio Railroad Company anunciaram um prémio de 4.000 dólares para o melhor motor em ensaios realizados em Junho de 1831. Davis criou a sua locomotiva de York e ganhou o concurso.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1832, o matemático, fotógrafo, e romancista inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll">Lewis Carroll</a>. Com o verdadeiro nome de Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, ele é conhecido pelas Aventuras de Alice no País das Maravilhas (1865) e a sua sequela. Depois de se formar no Christ Church College, Oxford em 1854, Dodgson permaneceu lá, dando palestras sobre matemática e tratados de escrita até 1881. Como matemático, Dodgson era conservador. Foi autor de um bom número de livros de matemática, por exemplo, A Syllabus of Plane Algebraical Geometry (1860). Os seus livros de matemática não provaram ter uma importância duradoura, excepto Euclides e os seus Rivais Modernos (1879), que são de interesse histórico. Como lógico, ele estava mais interessado na lógica como um jogo do que como um instrumento para testar a razão.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1888, o geoquímico e mineralogista suíço-norueguês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Goldschmidt">Victor Goldschmidt</a>. Ele estabeleceu uma base teórica para a geoquímica (que no século anterior se tinha limitado à recolha de dados sobre a crosta terrestre acessível, águas e atmosfera). Goldschmidt investigou os elementos maiores e menores nos minerais, e procurou explicar a sua distribuição como resultado de origens cósmicas. Inventou a química cristalina, através da qual tentou completar um registo das formas de cristais minerais, e ligar as variações dessas formas às condições físicas e químicas sob as quais foram formadas. Nesta busca, melhorou os instrumentos existentes e inventou novos instrumentos. É considerado como o fundador da geoquímica moderna.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1936, o físico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_C._C._Ting">Samuel C. C. Ting</a>. Ele partilhou (com Burton Richter) o Prémio Nobel da Física de 1976 pela sua descoberta de uma nova partícula subatómica, a partícula J/psi. Mais recentemente, tem sido o principal investigador na investigação conduzida com o Espectrómetro Magnético Alfa, um dispositivo instalado na Estação Espacial Internacional em 2011.</p>

<p>Em 1951 é feita a primeira detonação controlada de uma bomba atómica. 'Able' foi o primeiro dispositivo nuclear lançado pelo ar a ser explodido em solo americano. O teste teve lugar em Frenchman Flat, um leito de rio seco no local de teste de Nevada. A explosão de 1 quilo-tonelada lançou a quarta série de testes nucleares dos EUA com o nome de código 'Ranger', que consistiu em cinco testes nucleares largados do ar no início de 1951.</p>

<p>Em 1967, um acidente com a Apollo 1 em Terra causou a morte dos astronautas Virgil “Gus” Grissom, Edward H. White II, e Roger B. Chaffee. Uma investigação indicou que um fio eléctrico defeituoso no interior do módulo de comando Apollo 1 foi a causa provável do incêndio. Os astronautas, os primeiros americanos a morrer numa nave espacial, tinham estado a participar numa simulação do lançamento da Apollo 1 programada para o mês seguinte.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker e alguns vídeos interessantes. São apresentadas as revistas MagPi nº 114 e a revista HackspaceMag nº 51 de Fevereiro. É também apresentado o livro "How to Build a Microcomputer … and Really Understand it".</p>

<p><em>"Securing the world’s data will be one of the greatest technology challenges over the next decade of compute. This is why Arm has been collaborating with the University of Cambridge for several years on its CHERI architecture, which defines hardware capabilities that would provide a fundamentally more secure building block for software. The Morello program, a five-year research initiative, involving a consortium led by Arm, was the result of this collaboration and aims to design a new, inherently more secure, Arm-based computing platform for the future. As a major part of this comprehensive research project, Arm has designed and built a system on a chip (SoC) and demonstrator board which contains the first example of the Morello prototype architecture. The Morello prototype boards are now being released, on schedule, and are ready for software developers and security specialists to start using the Morello architecture to demonstrate the enhanced security that can be achieved with hardware capabilities. A closer look at the new Morello prototype board The limited-edition boards are based on the Morello prototype architecture embedded into an Armv8.2-A processor (an adaptation of the Arm Neoverse N1 processor)."</em> <a href="https://www.arm.com/company/news/2022/01/morello-research-program-hits-major-milestone-with-hardware-now-available-for-testing">[...]</a>

This mid-course correction burn inserted Webb toward its final orbit around the second Sun-Earth Lagrange point, or L2, nearly 1 million miles away from the Earth. The final mid-course burn added only about 3.6 miles per hour (1.6 meters per second) – a mere walking pace – to Webb’s speed, which was all that was needed to send it to its preferred “halo” orbit around the L2 point. “Webb, welcome home!” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. “Congratulations to the team for all of their hard work ensuring Webb’s safe arrival at L2 today.

Perovskites are hybrid compounds made from metal halides and organic constituents. They show great potential in a range of applications, e.g. LED lights, lasers, and photodetectors, but their major contribution is in solar cells, where they are poised to overtake the market from their silicon counterparts. One of the obstacles facing the commercialization of perovskite solar cells is that their power-conversion efficiency and operational stability drop as they scale up, making it a challenge to maintain high performance in a complete solar cell.

The potential power of quantum computers lies in their ability to process ‘qubits’ that can take a value of zero or one—or be some fuzzy mix of both simultaneously. “However, to reuse the same circuit for multiple operations, you have to force the qubits back to zero fast,” says Jaw Shen Tsai, a quantum physicist at the RIKEN Center for Quantum Computing.

Materials theorist Boris Yakobson and his colleagues at Rice’s George R. Brown School of Engineering found through atom-level simulations that iron itself plays a role in its own corrosion when exposed to supercritical CO2 (sCO2) and trace amounts of water by promoting the formation of reactive species in the fluid that come back to attack it. In their research, published in the Cell Press journal Matter, they conclude that thin hydrophobic layers of 2D materials like graphene or hexagonal boron nitride could be employed as a barrier between iron atoms and the reactive elements of sCO2.

In the first millionths of a second after the Big Bang, the universe was a roiling, trillion-degree plasma of quarks and gluons — elementary particles that briefly glommed together in countless combinations before cooling and settling into more stable configurations to make the neutrons and protons of ordinary matter. In the chaos before cooling, a fraction of these quarks and gluons collided randomly to form short-lived “X” particles, so named for their mysterious, unknown structures. Today, X particles are extremely rare, though physicists have theorized that they may be created in particle accelerators through quark coalescence, where high-energy collisions can generate similar flashes of quark-gluon plasma. Now physicists at MIT’s Laboratory for Nuclear Science and elsewhere have found evidence of X particles in the quark-gluon plasma produced in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, based near Geneva, Switzerland.

Scientists in 2018 had thought they were looking at liquid water when they saw bright radar reflections under the polar cap. However, the new study published Jan. 24 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters found that the reflections matched those of volcanic plains found all over the red planet’s surface. The researchers think their conclusion — volcanic rock buried under ice — is a more plausible explanation for the 2018 discovery, which was already in question after scientists calculated the unlikely conditions needed to keep water in a liquid state at Mars’ cold, arid south pole. “For water to be sustained this close to the surface, you need both a very salty environment and a strong, locally generated heat source, but that doesn’t match what we know of this region,” said the study’s lead author, Cyril Grima, a planetary scientist at the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics (UTIG).

This edge movement, which is the essence of the quantum Hall effect, can lead to many interesting properties depending on the material and conditions. For conventional electrons, the current flows only in one direction dictated by the magnetic field (‘downstream’). However, physicists have predicted that some materials can have counter-propagating channels where some quasiparticles can also travel in the opposite (‘upstream’) direction.

<p><em>"MIT neuroscientists have developed a computer model that can answer that question as well as the human brain. The human brain is finely tuned not only to recognize particular sounds, but also to determine which direction they came from. By comparing differences in sounds that reach the right and left ear, the brain can estimate the location of a barking dog, wailing fire engine, or approaching car. MIT neuroscientists have now developed a computer model that can also perform that complex task. The model, which consists of several convolutional neural networks, not only performs the task as well as humans do, it also struggles in the same ways that humans do. “We now have a model that can actually localize sounds in the real world,” says Josh McDermott, an associate professor of brain and cognitive sciences and a member of MIT’s McGovern Institute for Brain Research."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/where-sound-come-from-model-0127">[...]</a>

The material is initially soft, but later hardens through a bone development process that uses the same materials found in the skeleton. When we are born, we have gaps in our skulls that are covered by pieces of soft connective tissue called fontanelles. It is thanks to fontanelles that our skulls can be deformed during birth and pass successfully through the birth canal. Post-birth, the fontanelle tissue gradually changes to hard bone.

<p><em>"The new qubits stay in “superposition” for up to 10 seconds, and could make a promising foundation for quantum computers. MIT physicists have discovered a new quantum bit, or “qubit,” in the form of vibrating pairs of atoms known as fermions. They found that when pairs of fermions are chilled and trapped in an optical lattice, the particles can exist simultaneously in two states — a weird quantum phenomenon known as superposition. In this case, the atoms held a superposition of two vibrational states, in which the pair wobbled against each other while also swinging in sync, at the same time. The team was able to maintain this state of superposition among hundreds of vibrating pairs of fermions. In so doing, they achieved a new “quantum register,” or system of qubits, that appears to be robust over relatively long periods of time."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/vibrating-atoms-qubits-0126">[...]</a>

<p><em>"From street and household lighting, to television and mobile displays, light emitting diodes (LEDs) play an essential role in modern life. Now, researchers from the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST) have developed blue LEDs based on a material called metal halide perovskite, that, for the first time, uses asymmetrical bridges to hold the layers of perovskite together, creating a more stable structure. The study, published recently in the Journal of the American Chemical Society on November 18th 2021, could bring perovskite LEDs one step closer to commercialization. “Perovskites have the potential to be a real game-changer in the lighting industry,” said first author Dr. Yuqiang Liu, a former post-doctoral researcher in the OIST Energy Materials and Surface Sciences Unit and currently a professor at Qingdao University, China. “In only a few short years, the efficiency of perovskite LEDs – how well they can transfer electrical energy into light energy – has shot up to a level that rivals traditional LEDs, and soon will surpass them.” Aside from efficiency levels, perovskite LEDs also have numerous advantages over current LED technologies on the market, as they have the potential to produce brighter, purer colors at a fraction of the production cost. However, the stability of perovskite LEDs remains a huge barrier, with the operational lifetime of even the most stable LEDs lasting only a few hundred hours."</em> <a href="https://www.oist.jp/news-center/press-releases/more-stable-blue-perovskite-leds">[...]</a>

In this system, consumers would coordinate with their electric utility operator to dynamically control big energy users, like heat pumps, water heaters and electric vehicle charging stations. This kind of flexible control over energy supply and use patterns is called “transactive” because it relies on an agreement between consumers and utilities.

In the first millionths of a second after the Big Bang, the universe was a roiling, trillion-degree plasma of quarks and gluons — elementary particles that briefly glommed together in countless combinations before cooling and settling into more stable configurations to make the neutrons and protons of ordinary matter. In the chaos before cooling, a fraction of these quarks and gluons collided randomly to form short-lived “X” particles, so named for their mysterious, unknown structures. Today, X particles are extremely rare, though physicists have theorized that they may be created in particle accelerators through quark coalescence, where high-energy collisions can generate similar flashes of quark-gluon plasma. Now physicists at MIT’s Laboratory for Nuclear Science and elsewhere have found evidence of X particles in the quark-gluon plasma produced in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, based near Geneva, Switzerland.

<p><em>"A hugely improved and updated version of my Artificial Life project using the Pimoroni Unicorn HAT HD! The project before This is an update on a previously existing project: Artificial Life which I made way back in the old times of 2017. It is essentially running a simulation on life forms represented by LED's on a matrix and seeing how they interact and evolve. It used the original Unicorn HAT which has an 8x8 array of RGB LEDs; perfect for drawing a board of life forms to move around. It was also running on an original Pi Zero - so the processing power wasn't so good, especially for expansion of the project. It was very glitchy, the life forms could pass and overwrite each other the image blanked out for a small amount of time as each life form moved and there was tons of messy/bad code that mad PyCharm sad."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/314reactor/artificial-life-hd-50ec45">[...]</a>

<p><em>"For detection is used high voltage (from 8000 to 15000 volts) The presence of Alpha radiation is manifested by small sparks between the anode and the cathode. This time I will show you how to make a very simple device that can detect Alpha radiation. The device is also called a Spark detector, because for detection is used high voltage (from 8000 to 15000 volts), and the presence of Alpha radiation is manifested by small sparks between the anode and the cathode. In this type of detector, thin negatively-charged wires are strung through atmospheric air above a planar anode, and sparking occurs when strongly ionizing radiation like alpha particles passes through the high-field region near the wires. The concept was first described by Chang and Rosenblum in 1945, and later it was made many times. Nowadays its making is extremely simple, thanks to these compact high voltage sources that can be purchased for a few dollars."</em> <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/183599-diy-simple-alpha-radiation-spark-detector-hv">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Using the ADP3450, this project measures amount of delay between asserting FPGA IO on base of NPN 2N3094 and LED illuminating on collector. Signal timing is a huge component in FPGA design, and while many tutorials demonstrate how to handle timing within the programmable logic I thought it would be helpful to show how to measure external circuitry timing when it's being driven by an FPGA's I/O and has a direct impact on the timing of the logic in RTL. Recently I posted a project about driving a 5-digit 7-segment display with an FPGA where I had to calculate the proper refresh rate of how long a character needed to be held on each display to appear stable to the human eye. Each common cathode of the 5 7-segment displays where connected to the collector of an NPN 2N3904 BJT that were connected to ground by an I/O pin from the FPGA being set high. Thus, past of this timing of the overall refresh rate included how long it would take for the collector to be connected to the emitter (and ultimately ground) after the FPGA I/O signal was asserted. Using the oscilloscope function of my Analog Discovery Pro ADP3450 with its control interface software WaveForms, I set up a test circuit with a single 2N3904 and LED on its collector to measure the amount of delay between the FPGA I/O pin being asserted on the base of the BJT to when the LED is illuminated."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/whitney-knitter/measuring-circuit-delay-for-fpga-timing-using-the-adp3450-45ed17">[...]</a>

When you connect it to your system port (whether Windows, Linux or even macOS) it starts to countdown when the counting is over it locks the system and this time starts counting the break phase the user cannot unlock your system at this time unless the time is overing or pull the timer out of the port. This timer, in addition to notifying the user of the LED by turning it on a few seconds before the start of the break phase, does not start the next Pomodoro without the user's approval. to start the new Pomodoro, it is enough to keystroke twice on the "Capslock'' with a delay of 1 second.
