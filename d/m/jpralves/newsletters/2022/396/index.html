<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1743, o químico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Heinrich_Klaproth">Martin Heinrich Klaproth</a>. Ele é considerado o fundador da química analítica, tendo descoberto o urânio (1789), zircónio (1789), cério (1803), e contribuído para a identificação de outros. Embora não os tenha isolado como amostras de puro metal, foi capaz de os reconhecer como novos elementos. Aos 16 anos, foi aprendiz de boticário. Depois de ler química em Hanover, instalou-se em Berlim (1771) e começou a sua própria loja de boticário (1780). No final de 1780, era o principal químico analítico da Europa. Klaproth encontrou formas de tratar compostos particularmente insolúveis, teve o cuidado de evitar a contaminação pelo seu aparelho, e insistiu significativamente em relatar "pequenas" discrepâncias de peso no trabalho analítico como resultados consistentes.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1792, o matemático russo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Lobachevsky">Nikolai Lobachevsky</a>. Ele, com János Bolyai da Hungria, é considerado o fundador da geometria não-euclidiana. Lobachevsky construiu e estudou um tipo de geometria em que o postulado paralelo de Euclides é falso (o postulado afirma que através de um ponto não numa determinada linha apenas uma linha pode ser desenhada não encontrando a primeira linha). Isto não foi bem recebido no início, mas a sua maior justificação veio com o advento da teoria da relatividade de Einstein quando foi demonstrado experimentalmente que a geometria do espaço não é descrita pela geometria de Euclides. Além da geometria, Lobachevsky também fez um importante trabalho na teoria das séries infinitas, equações algébricas, cálculo integral, e probabilidades.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1905, o físico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Zener">Clarence Zener</a>. Ele foi o primeiro a descrever a propriedade relativa à interrupção dos isoladores eléctricos. Estas descobertas foram posteriormente exploradas pelos Laboratórios Bell no desenvolvimento do díodo Zener, que recebeu o seu devido nome. Zener era um físico teórico com formação em matemática que conduziu investigação numa vasta gama de assuntos, incluindo: supercondutividade, metalurgia, ferromagnetismo, elasticidade, mecânica da fractura, difusão, e programação geométrica.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1925, o bioquímico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Rodbell">Martin Rodbell</a>. Ele recebeu o Prémio Nobel da Fisiologia ou Medicina de 1994 pela sua descoberta nos anos 60 de transdutores de sinal naturais chamados G-proteínas que ajudam as células do corpo a comunicar entre si. Partilhou o prémio com Alfred G. Gilman, que mais tarde provou a hipótese de Rodbell, isolando a proteína G, assim denominada porque se liga a nucleótidos chamados difosfato de guanosina e trifosfato de guanosina, ou PIB e GTP. Antes da investigação de Rodbell, os cientistas acreditavam que apenas duas substâncias - um receptor hormonal e uma enzima celular interior - eram responsáveis pela comunicação celular. Rodbell, contudo, descobriu que a proteína G actuava como um transdutor de sinal intermédio entre as duas.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1940, o engenheiro electrotécnico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Lawson_(engineer)">Jerry Lawson</a>. Ele é conhecido pelo seu trabalho na concepção da consola de videojogos Fairchild Channel F, bem como por liderar a equipa que foi pioneira no cartucho comercial de videojogos. Foi assim apelidado de "pai do cartucho de videojogos", segundo a revista Black Enterprise em 1982. Acabou por sair da Fairchild e fundou a empresa de jogos Video-Soft.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1941, o físico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Benton">Stephen Benton</a>. Ele foi pioneiro em imagem médica e holografia de belas artes. O seu fascínio pelos fenómenos ópticos começou com os óculos 3-D que usou quando tinha 11 anos para ver o filme House of Wax, de 1953. Em 1968, inventou os "hologramas arco-íris", vistos em cartões de crédito enquanto trabalhava para a Polaroid Corporation. Voltou-se para a academia como professor assistente em Harvard (1968) e mais tarde como professor no Massachusetts Institute of Technology a partir de 1985, onde ajudou a criar o Spatial Imaging Group e dirigiu o programa de arte e ciências dos media M.I.T. Benton foi pioneiro na holografia da luz natural como meio artístico, e foi curador no Museu de Holografia em Manhanttan até ao seu encerramento em 1992.</p>

<p>Em 1997, oito planetas do nosso Sistema Solar alinharam-se de Oeste para Leste, começando por Plutão, seguido por Mercúrio, Marte, Vénus, Neptuno, Urano, Júpiter e Saturno, com uma lua crescente ao lado, num raro alinhamento visível da Terra que durou até 8 de Dezembro. Mercúrio, Marte, Vénus, Júpiter e Saturno são visíveis a olho nu, sendo Vénus e Júpiter, de longe, os mais brilhantes. É necessário um bom par de binóculos para ver os pequenos pontos azuis que são Urano e Neptuno. Plutão é visível apenas por telescópio. Os planetas também se alinharam em Maio de 2000, mas demasiado perto do sol para serem visíveis da Terra. Passar-se-ão pelo menos mais 100 anos até que tantos planetas estejam tão perto e tão visíveis.</p>

<p><em>"Texas Instruments (TI) (Nasdaq: TXN) today announced an expansion in its portfolio of space-grade analog semiconductor products in highly reliable plastic packages for a diverse range of missions. TI developed a new device screening specification called space high-grade in plastic (SHP) for radiation-hardened products and introduced new analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) that meet the SHP qualification. TI also introduced new product families to the radiation-tolerant Space Enhanced Plastic (Space EP) portfolio. Compared to traditional ceramic packages, plastic packages offer a smaller footprint that enables designers to reduce system-level size, weight and power, and thus help reduce launch costs. In the past, space applications and programs used hermetically sealed, ceramic Qualified Manufacturers List (QML) Class V devices to ensure reliability. Today, applications like those in new space, designed to increase commercial access to space programs through short-term missions in low Earth orbit (LEO), are helping expand communication and connectivity."</em> <a href="https://news.ti.com/ti-expands-space-grade-product-portfolio-with-radiation-hardened-and-radiation-tolerant-plastic-packages-for-missions-from-new-space-to-deep-space">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4498.html">STMicroelectronics boosts all-round performance in op amps for industrial and automotive environments</a></h2>

<p><em>"STMicroelectronics is simplifying designers’ search for high-performing operational amplifiers (op amps) by introducing three new 6MHz rail-to-rail devices with strong all-round parameters including a wide operating-voltage range and low noise. The TSB511, TSB512, and TSB514 are single, dual, and quad op amps, respectively. They can operate from a single supply in the range from 2.7V to 36V, and with dual supplies from ±1.35V to ±18V. This wide voltage range and flexibility let engineers benefit from applying a familiar op-amp type across various applications and different power domains. The rail-to-rail input and output help ensure suitable dynamic range when operating close to the minimum supply voltage. Input noise density of 12nV/√Hz allows use in circuits where signal integrity is a priority, particularly with weak or wideband signals."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4498.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The update will make Ingenuity more capable in hilly terrain. NASA's Mars helicopter Ingenuity has performed its shortest-ever flight, the first after a major software update that will allow the little chopper to land more safely and navigate over rugged terrain. Ingenuity's 34th flight, which took place on Tuesday (Nov. 22), lasted only 18 seconds and saw the helicopter briefly hover after takeoff above Mars' surface before landing just 16 feet (5 meters) away from its starting point. The flight, the first since Sept. 29, was the first try-out of a new software system that was beamed to Ingenuity from Earth to improve its ability to operate in the rugged terrain that its parent Perseverance rover is currently exploring. Ingenuity is an extremely successful technology demonstration, but it was built to navigate in smooth terrain, such as Wright Brothers Field, where it was first deployed in April 2021. The helicopter has been nailing one flight after another, prompting its ground control teams to dare to begin sending the flying robot into more complicated landscapes."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/ingenuity-mars-helicopter-flight-34-new-software">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/news/neuralink-demo-shows-monkey-telepathic-typing/">Neuralink demo shows monkey performing ‘telepathic typing’</a></h2>

<p><em>"Neuralink owner Elon Musk said paperwork for human trials has been submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which he claimed could lead to human trials of the company’s brain-implant technology “in about six months.” Neuralink, which Musk helped to set up in 2016, is developing a system that directly links the human brain to a computer interface. It believes the technology, part of which is implanted directly into the brain, will one day allow the human mind to control gadgets and programs merely through thought, potentially opening up a whole new world for people with brain disorders and conditions such as paralysis. In April 2021, Neuralink demonstrated early trials of the technology by showing a monkey playing a game of Pong just by thinking about it. This time, at a special show-and-tell event held on Wednesday evening, a new video showed a different monkey using thought processes to move a mouse cursor around a keyboard while also making selections to create words. Describing the monkey’s actions as “telepathic typing,” Musk said the demonstration raises the possibility of “someone with no interface with the outside world [being able] to control their phone better than someone who has working hands.” You can watch the monkey in action in the video below: Musk said he believed Neuralink’s technology was now at a point where human trials would be safe, going so far as to say that if one of his own children suffered an accident where Neuralink’s technology could potentially help, he would “feel comfortable” going ahead with the implant, adding, “At least in my opinion, it would not be dangerous.” The Neuralink co-founder has said previously that future, more advanced versions of the technology may even be able to function in a way that will enable paraplegics to walk again. But, of course, regulators will have the final say on its use, with Neuralink hoping to get the green light from the FDA next year to take its technology to the next level."</em> <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/news/neuralink-demo-shows-monkey-telepathic-typing/">[...]</a>

The spacecraft Shenzhou-15, or "Divine Vessel", and its three passengers lifted off atop a Long March-2F rocket from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre at 11:08 p.m. (1508 GMT) on Tuesday in sub-freezing temperatures in the Gobi Desert in northwest China, according to state television. Shenzhou-15 was the last of 11 missions, including three previous crewed missions, needed to assemble the "Celestial Palace", as the multi-module station is known in Chinese. The first mission was launched in April 2021. The spacecraft docked with the station more than six hours after the launch, and the three Shenzhou-15 astronauts were greeted with warm hugs from the previous Shenzhou crew from whom they were taking over. The Shenzhou-14 crew, who arrived in early June, will return to Earth after a one-week handover that will establish the station's ability to temporarily sustain six astronauts, another record for China's space programme."</em> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/science/china-launches-crewed-spacecraft-chinese-space-station-state-television-2022-11-29/">[...]</a>

The research project known as HETDEX, or the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment, is based at The University of Texas at Austin’s McDonald Observatory and relies on volunteers who participate online in a project called Dark Energy Explorers. With a smartphone or computer, participants can experience what it’s like to be an astronomer, teasing apart the mysteries of the universe while helping professional astronomers find distant galaxies and learn more about the mysterious force known as dark energy, which is causing the universe to rapidly expand. Since Dark Energy Explorers launched in February 2021, more than 10,000 volunteers have identified approximately 240,000 galaxies. That amounts to almost one-tenth of the number of galaxies the researchers expect to ultimately find in their survey of a patch of sky that includes most of the Big Dipper and is about the size of 2,000 full moons."</em> <a href="https://news.utexas.edu/2022/11/30/amateur-scientists-have-helped-astronomers-identify-nearly-a-quarter-million-galaxies/">[...]</a>

But sometimes the lack of symmetry in a crystal makes the surface energies of its facets unknowable, confounding any theoretical prediction of its shape. Theorists at Rice University say they’ve found a way around this conundrum by assigning arbitrary latent energies to its surfaces or, in the case of two-dimensional materials, its edges. Yes, it seems like cheating, but in the same way a magician finds a select card in a deck by narrowing the possibilities, a little algebraic sleight-of-hand goes a long way to solve the problem of predicting a crystal’s shape.

They have now demonstrated a programmable, wireless device that can control light, such as by focusing a beam in a specific direction or manipulating the light’s intensity, and do it orders of magnitude more quickly than commercial devices."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/control-light-beam-holograms-1128">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A Cornell team has created an interface that allows users to handwrite and sketch within computer code – a challenge to conventional coding, which typically relies on typing. The pen-based interface, called Notate, lets users of computational, digital notebooks – such as Jupyter notebooks, which are web-based and interactive – to open drawing canvases and handwrite diagrams within lines of traditional, digitized computer code. Powered by a deep learning model, the interface bridges handwritten and textual programming contexts: Notation in the handwritten diagram can reference textual code and vice versa. For instance, Notate recognizes handwritten programming symbols, like “n,” and then links them up to their typewritten equivalents. In a case study, users drew quantum circuit diagrams inside of Jupyter notebook code cells. The tool was described in “Notational Programming for Notebook Environments: A Case Study with Quantum Circuits,” presented at the ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology, held Oct. 29 through Nov. 2 in Bend, Oregon."</em> <a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2022/11/programming-tool-turns-handwriting-computer-code">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Cooling accounts for about 15 percent of global energy consumption. Conventional clear windows allow the sun to heat up interior spaces, which energy-guzzling air-conditioners must then cool down. But what if a window could help cool the room, use no energy and preserve the view? Tengfei Luo, the Dorini Family Professor of Energy Studies at the University of Notre Dame, and postdoctoral associate Seongmin Kim have devised a transparent coating for windows that does just that. The coating, or transparent radiative cooler (TRC), allows visible light to come in and keeps other heat-producing light out. The researchers estimate that this invention can reduce electric cooling costs by one-third in hot climates compared to conventional glass windows."</em> <a href="https://news.nd.edu/news/engineers-use-quantum-computing-to-develop-transparent-window-coating-that-blocks-heat-saves-energy/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"UNSW Sydney research demonstrates a 20x improvement in resetting a quantum bit to its ‘0’ state, using a modern version of the ‘Maxwell’s demon’. A team of quantum engineers at UNSW Sydney has developed a method to reset a quantum computer – that is, to prepare a quantum bit in the ‘0’ state – with very high confidence, as needed for reliable quantum computations. The method is surprisingly simple: it is related to the old concept of ‘Maxwell’s demon’, an omniscient being that can separate a gas into hot and cold by watching the speed of the individual molecules. “Here we used a much more modern ‘demon’ – a fast digital voltmeter – to watch the temperature of an electron drawn at random from a warm pool of electrons. In doing so, we made it much colder than the pool it came from, and this corresponds to a high certainty of it being in the ‘0’ computational state,” says Professor Andrea Morello of UNSW, who led the team. “Quantum computers are only useful if they can reach the final result with very low probability of errors."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/science-tech/new-quantum-computing-feat-modern-twist-150-year-old-thought-experiment">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Battery power from electric vehicles to the grid could open a fast lane to a net-zero future. Owners of electric vehicles (EVs) are accustomed to plugging into charging stations at home and at work and filling up their batteries with electricity from the power grid. But someday soon, when these drivers plug in, their cars will also have the capacity to reverse the flow and send electrons back to the grid. As the number of EVs climbs, the fleet’s batteries could serve as a cost-effective, large-scale energy source, with potentially dramatic impacts on the energy transition, according to a new paper published by an MIT team in the journal Energy Advances. “At scale, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) can boost renewable energy growth, displacing the need for stationary energy storage and decreasing reliance on firm [always-on] generators, such as natural gas, that are traditionally used to balance wind and solar intermittency,” says Jim Owens, lead author and a doctoral student in the MIT Department of Chemical Engineering.

When sunlight reflects on an oily puddle of water in a parking lot, it creates a rainbow of swirling colors. That's because of the thin film interference principle, which explains how light reflects off of different layers, or films, in a mixture of liquids. For David Hoffman, an associate scientist at the Department of Energy's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, however, what's happening in those mixtures is a lot more than just pretty colors. The thin interfaces that produce those colors have major implications across biology, chemistry and the oil and pharmaceutical industries, among others.

This IC has a lot of configurations and circuit arrangements. We can design some small sections of a circuit using this IC without using any microcontroller. This IC has some applications in generating square wave up to 500khz with an adjustable duty cycle, generating precise time delays under monostable mode, bistable mode to make a two-latch switch configuration and Schmitt trigger."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/LithiumION/rebuilding-ic555-astable-multivibrator-caca0c">[...]</a>

<p>_"For the casual flight simmer, a peripheral device that sits somewhere between arcade and realism. Hopefully this will inspire someone to make something cool! How it works: I built this device to work with Microsoft Flight Simulator on the Xbox series S, although I suspect it should work for PC as well. The main idea here is to use a USB compatible Arduino (or other microcontroller), to emulate a standard old keyboard and thus send instruction to the game via key commands. We can accomplish this using the Arduino Keyboard library. **You MUST use a USB compatible board for this."_ <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Flight-Simulator-Switch-Panel-for-XboxPC/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"MPU-9250 is one of the most advanced combined accelerometer, gyroscope and compass small size sensors currently available. It replaces the popular MPU-9150 lowering the power consumption, improving gyro noise and compass full scale range performance. It has many advanced features, including low pass filtering, motion detection and even a programmable specialized processor. Internally it includes the MPU-6500, which contains a 3-axis gyroscope plus a 3-axis accelerometer, and the AK8963, the market leading 3-axis digital compass. The MPU-9250 uses 16-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) for digitizing all 9 axes. The MPU-9250 is a high performance accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer option for use in applications such as gesture recognition, self-balancing robots, cell phones, fitness monitoring and similar applications where detection of movement direction and magnitude along with rotation is desired."</em> <a href="https://www.hibit.dev/posts/73/getting-real-time-position-using-mpu9250">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This Arduino code controls a 12V DC motor (linear actuator) using an Adafruit TB6612 1.2A DC Motor Driver and external 12V power supply. For this project, I wanted to control a motor, specifically a linear actuator (with linear motion), using a 12V power supply. For this to work, I found that I needed an Adafruit TB6612 motor driver breakout board in addition to the Arduino Uno board. This driver can control 2 DC motors, or 1 stepper motor (a DC motor usually has 2 wires, while a stepper motor has more than 2 wires coming out of it). Since I had difficulty finding a good Adafruit wiring diagram for a DC motor (with two wires coming out of it), I've made one here for you with Fritzing! For this tutorial, I am using a 12V DC motor (a stepper motor would also work but would require different wiring, explained on the Adafruit.com TB6612 tutorial)."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/bobowman/12v-dc-motor-controlled-by-adafruit-tb6612-motor-driver-feec83">[...]</a>

<p><em>"An MQTT Earthquake Seismc Sensor with M5StickC and SPK HAT Living in a highly seismic activity city brings its own challenges. Waking up in the middle of the night with a shake and wondering the epicenter and magnitude of the earthquake, praying that everyone you love is safe etc. You start browsing through each of the Seismology networks to get a little bit more knowledge about it but you have to wait at least some minutes to get some reliable information about this specific earthquake. Having a smart home with lights, rolling shutters, lots of sensors, actuators etc., an earthquake sensor was the missing piece. If only there was an affordable sensor which will activate during an earthquake and gives audio and visual warning, shut off gas valves, open some doors, rolling shutters and lights for a safe escape route. A professional or amateur grade seismograph or structural vibration sensors were out of question for me since I am nowhere near being a seismologist or do I have the time to analyze the output of these sensors."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/fe-b/seismom5-earthquake-sensor-9982d9">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.instructables.com/Midbar-ESP8266-Version/">Midbar (ESP8266 Version)</a></h2>

<p><em>"A while ago, I made the ESP32 version of Midbar which later evolved into a multi-user Cipherbox. While developing the Cipherbox, I realized that even the Lite version of it might be too expensive and too redundant for some people, so I "resurrected" the single-user Midbar project and made an ESP8266 version of it. The purpose of Midbar is to significantly increase the cost of unauthorized access to its user's personal data. ESP8266 version of Midbar utilizes the 3DES + AES + Blowfish + Serpent encryption algorithm alongside the ESP8266's built-in memory to store eight passwords and four credit cards in the encrypted form. It also utilizes the HMAC SHA-256 to verify the integrity of the stored logins, which means that if at least one bit of an encrypted login gets flipped, Midbar will inform you about it by displaying the following alert: "Integrity Verification Failed!!!" In case you've missed the original Midbar or just want to know why I called it Midbar in the first place - Midbar (מדבר) is a Hebrew word that means "pasture," "uninhabited land," "wilderness," "large tracts of wilderness (around cities)," "desert.""</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Midbar-ESP8266-Version/">[...]</a>
