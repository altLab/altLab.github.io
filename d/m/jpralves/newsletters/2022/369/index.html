<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1667, o matemático francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_de_Moivre">Abraham De Moivre</a>. Ele foi pioneiro no desenvolvimento da trigonometria analítica e na teoria da probabilidade. Publicou The Doctrine of Chance em 1718. A definição de independência estatística aparece neste livro, juntamente com muitos problemas com os dados e outros jogos. Também investigou estatísticas de mortalidade e o fundamento da teoria das anuidades. Morreu na pobreza, e previu correctamente o dia da sua própria morte. Descobriu que dormia 15 minutos mais cada noite e a partir daí a progressão aritmética, calculou que morreria no dia em que dormisse durante 24 horas.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1814, o soprador de vidro alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Gei%C3%9Fler">Heinrich Geissler</a>. Ele conhou o nome da bomba de vácuo Geissler (mercúrio) e o tubo Geissler. Com o baixo vácuo sem precedentes (1/100 mm de mercúrio) que produzia em tubos de vidro selados, colocou à disposição dos primeiros físicos uma ferramenta valiosa para estudar o efeito da electricidade sobre os vestígios de gases restantes. Estes produziram estudos mais detalhados sobre a estrutura da matéria.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1867, o químico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Stieglitz">Julius Stieglitz</a>. Ele interpretou o comportamento e a estrutura dos compostos orgânicos à luz da teoria da valência e aplicou os métodos da físico-química à química orgânica. A sua investigação em campos como os rearranjos moleculares e a estereoquímica ajudou a lançar as bases da físico-química orgânica. Durante a Primeira Guerra Mundial, aconselhou o governo sobre como superar a escassez de produtos químicos provenientes da Alemanha. Foi muito activo no desenvolvimento de gases, corantes e químicos de guerra para as forças militares americanas durante a Primeira Guerra Mundial. Foi presidente do comité sobre drogas sintéticas do Conselho Nacional de Investigação.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1874, o aviador e designer de aviões francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Farman">Henri Farman</a>. Ele desenvolveu os ailerons (1908) para resolver os problemas extremamente difíceis e perigosos do controlo lateral. A sua inovação veio posteriormente a ser generalizada em todos os aviões. Os seus primeiros passos na concepção de aviões começaram em 1907 quando encomendou o seu próprio avião incorporando as suas modificações de concepção de um diedro nas asas e a redução da cauda para um único avião. Estas modificações intuitivas e não científicas foram o início de uma longa carreira na qual Farman diagnosticou e resolveu uma miríade de problemas estruturais e de controlo de aeronaves. O Farman "Golias" foi o primeiro avião de passageiros de longa distância, começando os voos regulares Paris-Londres em 8 de Fevereiro de 1919.</p>

<p>E nesta semana que passou foi lançada a versão final do Kernel Linux 5.18. Foram feitas optimizações no ficheiros de cabeçalhos do kernel que permitem uma compilação mais rápida. Para que se possa compilar o Kernel é agora necessário um compilador com o C11 Standard. Foram feitas melhorias ao nivel do filesystem Btrfs. Foi introduzido suporte para o Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W. Foram também introduzidas melhorias nos processadores RISC-V, AMD EPYC, MIPS e ARM.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker e alguns vídeos interessantes. É apresentada a revista Hackspace nº55 de Junho e a revista MagPi Nº118 de Junho.</p>

<p><em>"Boeing’s [NYSE: BA] CST-100 Starliner spacecraft made its first connection to the International Space Station at 7:28 p.m. Central Time (0028 UTC) today to complete a primary goal of the program’s Orbital Flight Test-2 (OFT-2). With no astronauts on board, Starliner’s autonomous systems and ground controllers in Houston guided the vehicle through a carefully choreographed series of maneuvers to steadily bring the Starliner closer to the orbiting laboratory before docking. Astronauts aboard the space station monitored Starliner throughout the flight and at times commanded the spacecraft to verify control capabilities. “Today’s successful docking of the Starliner is another important step in this rehearsal for sending astronauts into orbit safely and reliably,” said Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security President and CEO Ted Colbert. Launching atop a human-rated United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket on May 19, 2022, from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, Starliner spent its first hours in space performing a series of system demonstrations allowing mission managers to verify the spacecraft was healthy and able to maneuver safely. After docking, the Starliner recharged its batteries using solar arrays located on the service module."</em> <a href="https://boeing.mediaroom.com/news-releases-statements?item=131053">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/news/2022/0517.html">Mitsubishi Electric Develops Technology for the Freeform Printing of Satellite Antennas in Outer Space</a></h2>

<p><em>"Mitsubishi Electric Corporation (TOKYO: 6503) announced today that the company has developed an on-orbit additive-manufacturing technology that uses photosensitive resin and solar ultraviolet light for the 3D printing of satellite antennas in the vacuum of outer space. The novel technology makes use of a newly developed liquid resin that was custom formulated for stability in vacuum. The resin enables structures to be fabricated in space using a low-power process that utilizes the sun's ultraviolet rays for photopolymerization. The technology specifically addresses the challenge of equipping small, inexpensive spacecraft buses with large structures, such as high-gain antenna reflectors, and enables on-orbit fabrication of structures that greatly exceed the dimensions of launch vehicle fairings. Resin-based on-orbit manufacturing is expected to enable spacecraft structures to be made thinner and lighter than conventional designs, which must survive the stresses of launch and orbital insertion, thereby reducing both total satellite weight and launch costs. Spacecraft antenna designs are challenging due to their conflicting requirements for high gain, wide bandwidth, and low weight."</em> <a href="https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/news/2022/0517.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"NASA and Boeing safely landed the company’s CST-100 Starliner spacecraft Wednesday in the desert of the western United States, completing the uncrewed Orbital Flight Test-2 (OFT-2) to the International Space Station to help prove the system is ready to fly astronauts. About four hours after departing the space station, Starliner touched down onto its airbags at 4:49 p.m. MDT, wrapping up the six-day flight, which tested the end-to-end capabilities of the crew-capable spacecraft. The landing followed a deorbit burn at 4:05 p.m., separation of the spacecraft’s service module, and successful deployment of its three main parachutes and six airbags. “NASA’s Commercial Crew Program and our industry partner, Boeing, today took a major and successful step on the journey to enabling more human spaceflight missions to the International Space Station on American spacecraft from American soil,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. “The OFT-2 mission represents the power of collaboration, which allows us to innovate for the benefit of humanity and inspire the world through discovery. This golden era of spaceflight wouldn’t be possible without the thousands of individuals who persevered and poured their passion into this great achievement.” As part of the flight test for NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, Boeing accomplished planned test objectives, including: - Starliner launch and normal trajectory to orbital insertion - Launch of United Launch Alliance’s (ULA) Atlas V and dual-engine Centaur second stage - Ascent abort emergency detection system validation - Starliner separation from the Atlas V rocket - Approach, rendezvous, and docking with International Space Station - Starliner hatch opening and closing, astronaut ingress, and quiescent mode - Crew habitability and internal interface evaluation - Starliner undocking and departure from space station - Starliner deorbit, and crew module separation from service module - Starliner descent and atmospheric entry with aero-deceleration system - Precision targeted landing and recovery “I am incredibly proud of the dedication and perseverance shown by the NASA, Boeing and ULA team culminating in the successful completion of Starliner’s second Orbital Flight Test from start to finish,” said Steve Stich, manager, NASA’s Commercial Crew Program."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-boeing-complete-starliner-uncrewed-flight-test-to-space-station">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Theoretical breakthrough creates path to manipulating quantum chaos for laboratory experiments, quantum computing and black-hole research A theoretical breakthrough in understanding quantum chaos could open new paths into researching quantum information and quantum computing, many-body physics, black holes, and the still-elusive quantum to classical transition. “By applying balanced energy gain and loss to an open quantum system, we found a way to overcome a previously held limitation that assumed interactions with the surrounding environment would decrease quantum chaos,” said Avadh Saxena, a theoretical physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory and member of the team that published the paper on quantum chaos in Physical Review Letters. “This discovery points to new directions in studying quantum simulations and quantum information theory.” Quantum chaos differs from classical-physics chaos theory. The latter seeks to understand deterministic, or non-random, patterns and systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions. The so-called butterfly effect is the most familiar example, whereby the flap of a butterfly’s wings in Texas could, through a bewilderingly complicated but not random chain of cause and effect, lead to a tornado in Kansas.

But for quantum computers to become an everyday reality, there is a long way to go and many challenging tests to pass. One of the tests involves using quantum computers to simulate the properties of materials for next-generation quantum technologies. In a new study from the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory and the University of Chicago, researchers performed quantum simulations of spin defects, which are specific impurities in materials that could offer a promising basis for new quantum technologies. The study improved the accuracy of calculations on quantum computers by correcting for noise introduced by quantum hardware."</em> <a href="https://www.anl.gov/article/argonne-scientists-use-quantum-computers-to-simulate-quantum-materials">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers at Florida State University’s Center for Advanced Power Systems (CAPS), in collaboration with Colorado-based Advanced Conductor Technologies, have demonstrated a new, ready-to-use superconducting cable system — an improvement to superconductor technology that drives the development of technologies such as all-electric ships or airplanes. In a paper published in Superconductor Science and Technology, the researchers demonstrated a system that uses helium gas for crucial cooling. Superconducting cables can move electrical current with no resistance, but they need very cold temperatures to function. “We want to make these cables smaller, with lower weight and lower volume,” said paper co-author Sastry Pamidi, a FAMU-FSU College of Engineering professor and CAPS associate director. “These are very efficient power cables, and this research is focused on improving efficiency and practicality needed to achieve the promise of next-generation superconductor technology.” Previous work showed that the body of superconducting cables could be cooled with helium gas, but the cable ends needed another medium for cooling, such as liquid nitrogen. In this paper, researchers overcame that obstacle and were able to cool an entire cable system with helium gas."</em> <a href="https://news.fsu.edu/news/science-technology/2022/05/24/fsu-researchers-collaborate-with-business-to-develop-next-generation-superconducting-cables/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Quantum materials emit light as though it were only a positive pulse, rather than a positive-negative oscillation. A laser pulse that sidesteps the inherent symmetry of light waves could manipulate quantum information, potentially bringing us closer to room temperature quantum computing. The study, led by researchers at the University of Regensburg and the University of Michigan, could also accelerate conventional computing. Quantum computing has the potential to accelerate solutions to problems that need to explore many variables at the same time, including drug discovery, weather prediction and encryption for cybersecurity. Conventional computer bits encode either a 1 or 0, but quantum bits, or qubits, can encode both at the same time. This essentially enables quantum computers to work through multiple scenarios simultaneously, rather than exploring them one after the other."</em> <a href="https://news.umich.edu/emulating-impossible-unipolar-laser-pulses-paves-the-way-for-processing-quantum-information/">[...]</a>

Mastering control over the dynamic interplay among optical, chemical and mechanical behavior in single-material, liquid crystalline elastomers, results in microposts that combine bending, twisting and turning into complex dances. The advancement could contribute toward further development of soft robotics and other devices. When humans twist and turn it is the result of complex internal functions: the body’s nervous system signals our intentions; the musculoskeletal system supports the motion; and the digestive system generates the energy to power the move. The body seamlessly integrates these activities without our even being aware that coordinated, dynamic processes are taking place. Reproducing similar, integrated functioning in a single synthetic material has proven difficult –few one-component materials naturally encompass the spatial and temporal coordination needed to mimic the spontaneity and dexterity of biological behavior."</em> <a href="https://news.engineering.pitt.edu/dancing-in-the-light/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Dr. Edwin L. Thomas, professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, a team of researchers from Texas A&amp;M University and Yonsei University recently discovered a helicoidal-shaped defect in layered polymers, uncovering how solvents can rapidly diffuse through layers and produce color changes. This research was recently published in Science Advances. In some human-interactive electronics, such as temperature gauges or health sensors, polymers are used that are capable of changing color depending on stimuli. This phenomenon is referred to as stimuli-interactive structural colors because the material reacts and changes color due to environmental changes, such as temperature, the presence of a solvent or solution. A material that has a one-dimensional periodic structure comprised of two (A and B) layers acts like a photonic crystal and can reflect light of a given wavelength (color) depending on the thickness of each layer. Stimuli-interactive structural color works by altering photonic crystals using external stimuli or forces."</em> <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/news/2022/05/msen-a-good-defect-researchers-discover-helicoidal-screw-dislocations-in-layered-polymers.html">[...]</a>

The human eye has the same neural circuit, which researchers think could be used to probe visual diseases at unprecedented resolution. To test shadow detection, the researchers put mice in a maze with nearly no light. The exit was marked by a black spot, just barely distinct from the surrounding darkness. By tracking how the mice moved through the maze and measuring the activity of neurons at the back of the eye – the retina – the team showed that a group of retinal cells known as OFF ganglion cells detected the extremely small dip in light levels. ‘Our goal is to go from molecules all the way up to behaviour,’ says Professor Petri Ala-Laurila, who holds a joint appointment at Aalto and the University of Helsinki."</em> <a href="https://www.aalto.fi/en/news/the-limits-of-vision-seeing-shadows-in-the-dark">[...]</a>

That endeavor is now at an end, though, thanks to new research from the University of Colorado Boulder. Graphyne has long been of interest to scientists because of its similarities to the “wonder material” graphene—another form of carbon that is highly valued by industry whose research was even awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2010. However, despite decades of work and theorizing, only a few fragments have ever been created before now.

<p><em>"I've recently been getting into chiptunes, including both writing music as well as programs to generate the sounds that play the music. My interest in sound generation goes back to 2018, when I wrote a small library for TI-84 calculators to control playback of 16 channels across four wave types on a connected Arduino, and later Raspberry Pi. The system was initially very primitive - it could only use sine, triangle, square, and sawtooth waves, and was only able to control the volume and frequency of the output. It also relied on PWM output through an RC filter, which sounded pretty crappy (but worked). Later versions added support for 8-bit PCM audio at 8000 Hz, but due to the space constraints of the TI-84, I could only store a few seconds of audio, even at such a crappy quality. About two years later, I decided to expand on this a little bit."</em> <a href="https://mcjack123.github.io/PSG/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Black /Green pill stm32f401 , high quality, low noise DAC based on 2 PWM timer channels with virtual software Sigma Delta ADC. DIY about $3-$9 (depends number of displays) low cost solution Software low noise DAC based on 2 PWM timer channels with virtual soft Sigma Delta ADC between stream from usb and PWM output. There is implemented "sigma-delta floating point encoder" workaround of native stm32f401 limit 10.5 bits on 44100 Hz (1904 levels=84MHz/44.1KHz ) So, we can have for only $3 ,very low noise , high sound quality solution, which better then most onboard sound cards ! There is implemented virtual software second order sigma delta adc for the shift quantization noise to high frequency. see here (it provide useful links at the end): https://www.analog.com/media/en/training-seminars/tutorials/MT-022.pdf But instead one bit ( two levels ) i use more bits (0-MAX_LEVELS) Same technology can be used for esp32 high quality sound rendering. stm32f401cdu6 version https://github.com/sdima1357/stm32f401cdu6_Audio stm32f401ccu6 version https://github.com/sdima1357/stm32f401ccAudioNative"</em> <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/185213-stm32-hifi-usb-sound-card-diy">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This is Arduino based and 3D printed nano quadcopter which flies on DC brushed motors. The name nano comes from the fact that the project is based on Arduino nano, which I think is one of the most successful dev boards ever made. This project isn't just another Hey - look what a cool thing I made, it is instead aimed at analysing and understanding the design decisions which need to be made when designing a quadcopter, thus it will be a bit lengthy. However if you want to understand quadcopters from the bottom up - stay with me! When I initially started working on the project (a shame to say - years ago...) I went along with Bluetooth 2.0 module as this was popular back then, however years passed by and many more Arduino modules got developed. Recently, I noticed that a couple more different nano modules such as BLE-Nano and RF-Nano (nRF24L01) are cheaply available on Aliexpress so I decided to revive this project and finally complete it."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-micro-Quadcopter/">[...]</a>
