<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1791, o físico francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A9lix_Savart">Félix Savart</a>. Ele pesquisou várias manifestações de vibração. Com Jean-Baptiste Biot, ele desenvolveu a Lei Biot-Savart (1820) relativa à intensidade do campo magnético em torno de um fio condutor de corrente. Após ter obtido uma licenciatura em medicina (1816), interessou-se pela física, começando pelo estudo do violino para explicar as contribuições dos seus componentes para o som das cordas. Apresentou uma memória sobre o tema à Academia das Ciências de Paris em 1819. Conduziu uma extensa pesquisa sobre a acústica, os padrões nodais dos sistemas vibratórios (incluindo as colunas de ar), e inquéritos relacionados sobre a elasticidade das substâncias. Investigou também a voz e a audição. Concebeu uma roda dentada rotativa para produzir um som de qualquer frequência através de uma palheta segurada contra ela, para medir os limites da audição de alta frequência.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1795, o químico francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Bienaim%C3%A9_Caventou">Joseph Bienaimé Caventou</a>. Ele destacou-se pela investigação que fez em parceria com Pierre-Joseph Pelletier sobre bases vegetais e as contribuições resultantes da química alcalóide para o campo da medicina. Eles ajudaram a fundar a química dos alcalóides vegetais. Isolaram a clorofila (1817), para a qual cunharam o nome francês clorofila em Ann. de Chimie(1818), IX, 195. As suas descobertas alcalóides incluíam estricnina (1818), brucina (1819), quinina (1820), cafeína (1821), e cinchonina. Em 1823, utilizando análises elementares em tubos fechados em que os alcalóides eram queimados, descobriram a presença de azoto nos compostos. Os alcalóides são compostos orgânicos que formam sais solúveis em água que desempenham várias funções na medicina, incluindo analgésicos (analgésicos analgésicos), e estimulantes respiratórios.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1926, o bioquímico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Berg">Paul Berg</a>. Ele fez "estudos fundamentais da bioquímica dos ácidos nucleicos, com particular atenção às técnicas de recombinação do ADN", para as quais partilhou o Prémio Nobel da Química em 1980 (com Walter Gilbert e Frederick Sanger). A experiência pioneira de Berg, na qual ele foi a primeira pessoa a construir uma molécula de recombinant-DNA, iniciou a engenharia genética. Tais moléculas contêm partes de ADN de diferentes espécies, por exemplo, um cromossoma de um vírus combinado com genes de um cromossoma bacteriano. As moléculas de ADN de vírus, sendo relativamente pequenas, são úteis para tais investigações. As aplicações práticas importantes incluem agora o fabrico de hormona humana com a ajuda de bactérias.</p>

<p>Em 1894, a Tower Bridge sobre o Rio Tâmisa em Londres foi oficialmente aberta pelo Príncipe de Gales. A ponte tem 240 m de comprimento e consiste em duas torres de ponte de 65 m ligadas no nível superior por duas passarelas horizontais, e um par central de básculas que podem abrir para permitir a navegação. Originalmente alimentado hidraulicamente, o mecanismo operacional foi convertido para um sistema electro-hidráulico em 1972.</p>

<p>Em 1908, por volta das 7:15 da manhã, a noroeste do Lago Baikal, Rússia, uma enorme bola de fogo quase tão brilhante como o Sol foi vista a atravessar o céu. Minutos mais tarde, houve um enorme clarão e uma onda de choque sentida até 650 km de distância. Sobre Tunguska, um meteorito com mais de 50 m de diâmetro, viajando a mais de 25 km por segundo penetrou na atmosfera terrestre, aquecida a cerca de 10.000 ºC e detonou 6 a 10 km acima do solo. A explosão libertou a energia de 10-50 Megatons de TNT, destruindo 2.200 km quadrados de floresta, não deixando qualquer vestígio de vida. A rocha Tunguska saiu da tempestade de meteoros Taurid Meteor que atravessa a órbita da Terra duas vezes por ano. A primeira expedição científica cujos registos sobrevivem foi feita pelo mineralogista russo Leonid Kulik em 1927.</p>

<p>Há 50 anos, em 1972, foi necessário acrescentar o primeiro segundo (leap-second) ao tempo do mundo, a fim de manter os relógios atómicos super-acurados a par da rotação da Terra. Desde a adopção deste sistema em 1972, em primeiro lugar devido à escolha inicial do valor do segundo (1/86400 dia solar médio do ano 1900) e, em segundo lugar, devido ao abrandamento geral da rotação da Terra. Até 2015, foi necessário acrescentar 26 segundos ao Tempo Universal Coordenado (UTC)</p>

<p>E hoje foram lançados três novos membros da família Pico. O Raspberry Pi Pico W tem um preço de 6 dólares, e traz à plataforma Pico rede sem fios 802.11n, mantendo ao mesmo tempo a compatibilidade total de pinos com o seu irmão mais velho. O Pico H ($5) e o Pico WH ($7) acrescentam cabeçalhos pré-populados, e o novo conector de 3 pinos de debug, ao Pico e ao Pico W respectivamente. O Pico H e o Pico W estão disponíveis hoje; o Pico WH estará disponível em Agosto.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker e alguns vídeos interessantes. É apresentada a revista MagPI nº119 de Julho.</p>

<p><em>"New product alert! In January last year, we launched the $4 Raspberry Pi Pico, our first product built on silicon designed here at Raspberry Pi. At its heart is the RP2040 microcontroller, built on TSMC’s 40nm low-power process, and incorporating two 133MHz Arm Cortex-M0+ cores, 264kB of on-chip SRAM, and our unique programmable I/O subsystem. Since launch, we’ve sold nearly two million Pico boards, and RP2040 has found its way into a huge number of third-party products. We always believed that RP2040 was a great fit for commercial and industrial applications, but the global semiconductor shortage has vastly accelerated adoption. With millions of units on hand today, and pipeline in place for tens of millions more, design engineers who have been let down by their current suppliers have a perfect excuse to experiment."</em> <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-pico-w-your-6-iot-platform/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Intel today announced that its second-generation Habana® Gaudi®2 deep learning processors have outperformed Nvidia’s A100 submission for AI time-to-train on the MLPerf industry benchmark. The results highlight leading training times on vision (ResNet-50) and language (BERT) models with the Gaudi2 processor, which was unveiled in May at the Intel Vision event. Why It Matters: The Gaudi platform from Habana Labs, Intel’s data center team focused on deep learning processor technologies, enables data scientists and machine learning engineers to accelerate training and build new or migrate existing models with just a few lines of code to enjoy greater productivity, as well as lower operational costs. What It Shows: Gaudi2 delivers dramatic advancements in time-to-train (TTT) over first-generation Gaudi and enabled Habana’s May 2022 MLPerf submission to outperform Nvidia’s A100-80G for eight accelerators on vision and language models. For ResNet-50, Gaudi2 delivers a 36% reduction in time-to-train as compared to Nvidia’s TTT for A100-80GB and a 45% reduction compared to an A100-40GB 8-accelerator server submission by Dell for both ResNet-50 and BERT. Compared to first-generation Gaudi, Gaudi2 achieves a 3x speed-up in training throughput for ResNet-50 and 4.7x for BERT."</em> <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/second-gen-habana-gaudi2-outperforms-nvidia-a100.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A concept in development at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory would allow potential planetary missions to chase interesting clues in subsurface oceans. Someday, a swarm of cellphone-size robots could whisk through the water beneath the miles-thick icy shell of Jupiter’s moon Europa or Saturn’s moon Enceladus, looking for signs of alien life. Packed inside a narrow ice-melting probe that would tunnel through the frozen crust, the tiny robots would be released underwater, swimming far from their mothercraft to take the measure of a new world. That’s the vision of Ethan Schaler, a robotics mechanical engineer at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, whose Sensing With Independent Micro-Swimmers (SWIM) concept was recently awarded $600,000 in Phase II funding from the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) program. The funding, which follows his 2021 award of $125,000 in Phase I NIAC funding to study feasibility and design options, will allow him and his team to make and test 3D-printed prototypes over the next two years. A key innovation is that Schaler’s mini-swimmers would be much smaller than other concepts for planetary ocean exploration robots, allowing many to be loaded compactly into an ice probe."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/swarm-of-tiny-swimming-robots-could-look-for-life-on-distant-worlds">[...]</a>

The earliest living things, including bacteria and single-celled organisms called archaea, inhabited a primarily oceanic planet without an ozone layer to protect them from the sun’s radiation. These microbes evolved rhodopsins — proteins with the ability to turn sunlight into energy, using them to power cellular processes. “On early Earth, energy may have been very scarce.

Now, researchers from the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) have demonstrated the control and modulation of acoustic waves with an electric field on chip for the first time. “Acoustic waves are promising as on-chip information carriers for both quantum and classical information processing but the development of acoustic integrated circuits has been hampered by the inability to control acoustic waves in a low-loss, scalable manner,” said Marko Loncar, Tiantsai Lin Professor of Electrical Engineering at SEAS and senior author on this work. “In this work, we showed we can control acoustic waves on an integrated lithium niobate platform, bringing us one step closer to an acoustic integrated circuit.” The research was published in Nature Electronics."</em> <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2022/06/tuning-sound-waves-chip">[...]</a>

<p><em>"An original approach to mass-producing low-cost solar cell foundation blocks could lead to the wide adoption of solar panels made from perovskite ink – a "miracle material" – according to research from the University of Surrey. In the paper published in Scientific Reports, Dr Ehsan Rezaee, a post-doctoral fellow of the Advanced Technology Institute (ATI) at the University of Surrey, explains his research: "The objective is simply to produce solar cell building blocks out of perovskite ink. Whilst perovskite ink is not a new technology, current inks do not guarantee seamless transitions on an industrial scale, as the manufacturing process needs to be highly controlled and optimised. "Our perovskite ink produces a fast and reproducible way to reliably fabricate these solar cell building blocks on a mass scale, paving the way for its use in commercial markets." Perovskite solar cells are a low-cost, lightweight solution and can be built either rigid or flexible, with more possibilities to easily transport and install. The new study examines the foundation blocks of solar cells made of perovskite rather than the traditional silicon, as perovskite cells harvest light through the visible part of the solar spectrum, which has more energy."</em> <a href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk/news/rethink-building-blocks-solar-panels-could-help-mass-production">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Berkeley engineers have created a new type of semiconductor laser that accomplishes an elusive goal in the field of optics: the ability to emit a single mode of light while maintaining the ability to scale up in size and power. It is an achievement that means size does not have to come at the expense of coherence, enabling lasers to be more powerful and to cover longer distances for many applications. A research team led by Boubacar Kanté, Chenming Hu Associate Professor in UC Berkeley’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS) and faculty scientist at the Materials Sciences Division of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), showed that a semiconductor membrane perforated with evenly spaced and same-sized holes functioned as a perfect, scalable laser cavity. They demonstrated that the laser emits a consistent, single wavelength, regardless of the size of the cavity. The researchers described their invention, dubbed Berkeley Surface Emitting Lasers (BerkSELs), in a study published today (Wednesday, June 29) in the journal Nature. “Increasing both size and power of a single-mode laser has been a challenge in optics since the first laser was built in 1960,” said Kanté."</em> <a href="https://engineering.berkeley.edu/news/2022/06/new-single-mode-semiconductor-laser-delivers-power-with-scalability/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"As our tech needs grow and the Internet of Things increasingly connects our devices and sensors together, figuring out how to provide power in remote locations has become an expanding field of research. Professor Seokheun “Sean” Choi — a faculty member in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Binghamton University’s Thomas J. Watson College of Engineering and Applied Science — has been working for years on biobatteries, which generate electricity through bacterial interaction. One problem he encountered: The batteries had a lifespan limited to a few hours. That could be useful in some scenarios but not for any kind of long-term monitoring in remote locations. In a new study, published in the Journal of Power Sources and supported by a $510,000 grant from the Office of Naval Research, Choi and his collaborators have developed a “plug-and-play” biobattery that lasts for weeks at a time and can be stacked to improve output voltage and current.

<p><em>"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) scientists recently obtained high-precision thermodynamic data on warm dense nitrogen at extreme conditions that could lead to a better understanding of the interiors of celestial objects like white dwarfs and exoplanets. The team, which includes researchers from the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Rochester, used an advanced technique that combines pre-compression in a diamond anvil cell and laser-driven shock compression at the Omega Laser Facility at the University of Rochester. Molecules of nitrogen (N2) make up 78% of the air we breathe.They are unique because the two nitrogen atoms in N2 are bound with a triple covalent bond, which is the strongest of all simple diatomic molecules. Nitrogen also is an important constituent of celestial bodies in the outer solar system and beyond. For example, ammonia (NH3) storms are believed to exist in giant planets like Jupiter, while the dwarf planet Pluto, Saturn’s icy moon Titan and Neptune’s icy moon Triton have N2-rich atmospheres. Previous studies with this powerful technique revealed experimental evidence for superionic water ice and helium rain in gas-giant planets."</em> <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/news/breaking-strongest-chemical-bonds-laser-shock-compression">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Only a fraction of the material that could be turned into new plastic is currently recycled. Researchers at Chalmers have now demonstrated how the carbon atoms in mixed waste can replace all fossil raw materials in the production of new plastic. The recycling method is inspired by the natural carbon cycle and could eliminate the climate impact of plastic materials, or even clean the air of carbon dioxide. “There are enough carbon atoms in waste to meet the needs of all global plastic production. Using these atoms, we can decouple new plastic products from the supply of virgin fossil raw materials. If the process is powered by renewable energy, we also get plastic products with more than 95% lower climate impact than those produced today, which effectively means negative emissions for the entire system,” says Henrik Thunman, Professor of Energy Technology at Chalmers University of Technology and one of the authors of the study published in the Journal of Cleaner Production."</em> <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/see/news/Pages/Pioneering-recycling-turns-mixed-waste-into-premium-plastics-with-no-climate-impact.aspx">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A Northwestern University-led team of researchers has developed a small, soft, flexible implant that relieves pain on demand and without the use of drugs. The first-of-its-kind device could provide a much-needed alternative to opioids and other highly addictive medications. The biocompatible, water-soluble device works by softly wrapping around nerves to deliver precise, targeted cooling, which numbs nerves and blocks pain signals to the brain. An external pump enables the user to remotely activate the device and then increase or decrease its intensity. After the device is no longer needed, it naturally absorbs into the body — bypassing the need for surgical extraction. The researchers believe the device will be most valuable for patients who undergo routine surgeries or even amputations that commonly require post-operative medications."</em> <a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2022/06/dissolving-implant-relieves-pain-without-drugs/">[...]</a>

Multipliers are typically used to develop higher voltages for relatively low-current applications such as laser systems, X-ray systems, air ionisers, cathode ray tubes etc... The circuit consists of cascading high-voltage capacitors and diodes, so theoretically each subsequent cascade of two capacitors and two diodes should double the input voltage.

<p><em>"A couple of months ago I got a new roll of pla, I was printing things for a few days without any worries. Last week I went to print a large piece, 200 meters of filament according to Cura... I assumed there would be enough but no... So I decided that it was the last time that happened to me and I thought that if I counted the meters used , I could know the meters that were left. So I got to work and here it is, my mini filament counter! To say that it is not a regressive counter, that is, it does not mark what you have and subtract it and does not keep the memory, you must write down what you are spending on each roll and thus be able to keep track."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Mini-Filament-Counter-for-3d-Printer-Minicontador-/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Rotate the potentiometers in the correct sequence to access system! Ever watched the movie 'Army of Thieves' on Netflix? This project was inspired by how the character in the movie open the vaults, and how intricate the combination locks on the vaults were. I created it having three different sets of combination sequence. If User input the correct first combination then access granted, else it will move on to the next stored combination sequence for the user to try again. And if that is correct access granted, else it will move on to the last stored combination sequence for the user to try one final time."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/c010rblind3ngineer/arduino-combination-safe-ac2c97">[...]</a>

I did a little video just to show there use, while I was making the video I thought I would show how I find the poles of the magnets used. I will be using my 3D Printer to print the parts needed. Other materials can be used, but accuracy is a key factor in the assembly.

<p><em>"ESP32 based computer for orbitrack that displays ECG shape and BPM charts, allowing to train at optimal load At the end of 2021 I got an orbitrack - and immediately wasn't happy about its in-built computer: not only it has poor visibility and no colors - but also its heart rate monitor works only when you keep hands on the bike's handlebar, it has no contacts on vertical moving parts. So I replaced it (in fact, did that a couple of weeks before the war hit, so shooting a video took just a bit longer than I anticipated) Even though this way speed/distance/calories data look nicer than on stock computer, that's not the main improvement. What is really important is that current heart rate is shown - both as a number and as a chart of BPM change over last 30 seconds - and most importantly, heart rate zone is color-coded. In order to get that part done, I've used uECG device which our team created a couple of years ago. In fact any other BLE heart rate monitor can be used as well - they won't give that nice ECG data, but they still output BPM and that's what matters most in practical terms. Heart rate zone defines how hard you are training and in which mode your body works."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/the_3d6/orbitrack-esp32-computer-with-ecg-ee66eb">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Parking is becoming one of the most common issues, it may be a Mall or a Theater, before entering the parking check if theirs any space! Introduction One of the most common problems today is a saturation of parking spaces. Vehicles continue to outnumber existing parking spaces, thus clogging roads. Incidences of violence over occupancy, deformed cars due to a space crunch, and overcharging for parking are some problems that result. Most cities propose increasing parking spaces to combat the problem. Parks and vacant plots are used as potential parking spaces and multi-level facilities are being built, irrespective of the limited land space and resources."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/ajinkyagokhale/iot-based-smart-parking-system-using-raspberry-pi-c7b2dc">[...]</a>
