<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1709, o químico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Sigismund_Marggraf">Andreas Marggraf</a>. Ele foi pioneiro no trabalho analítico. Ele utilizou o teste de chama para distinguir entre potassa e refrigerante. Isolou o zinco do seu minério de calamina, e reconheceu a alumina na argila. Em 1747, Marggraf demonstrou que vários tipos de raízes de beterraba continham açúcar e que o açúcar podia ser extraído e cristalizado. O significado prático desta descoberta não foi reconhecido na altura, durante muitos anos foi considerado como um mero exercício laboratorial. Contudo, algumas décadas mais tarde, levou ao desenvolvimento da indústria açucareira moderna, quando Franz Karl Achard, um aluno de Marggraf, atacou o problema do cultivo da beterraba. Achard conseguiu extrair açúcar da beterraba a uma escala comercial.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1838, o astrónomo matemático norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_William_Hill">George William Hill</a>. Ele foi considerado por muitos dos seus pares como o maior mestre da mecânica celestial do seu tempo. Hill juntou-se ao Gabinete do Almanaque Náutico em 1861. Ele calculou a órbita da lua enquanto fazia contribuições originais para o problema dos três corpos. Introduziu infinitos determinantes, um conceito que mais tarde encontrou aplicação em muitos campos da matemática e da física. Quando Simon Newcomb assumiu o Almanaque Náutico em 1877 e começou uma recomputação completa de todos os movimentos do sistema solar, a Hill foi atribuído o difícil problema das órbitas de Júpiter e Saturno. Após completar o enorme trabalho em dez anos, regressou à sua quinta, onde continuou a sua pesquisa em mecânica celestial.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1845, o matemático russo-alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor">Georg Cantor</a>. Ele criou a teoria moderna dos conjuntos e a ampliou para dar o conceito de números transfinitos, com classes de números cardinais e ordinais. Embora o primeiro trabalho de Cantor se tenha preocupado com as séries de Fourier, a sua reputação assenta na sua contribuição para a teoria dos conjuntos transfinitas. Começou com a definição de conjuntos infinitos proposta por Dedekind em 1872: um conjunto é infinito quando é semelhante a uma parte própria de si mesmo. Os conjuntos com esta propriedade, tais como o conjunto de números naturais, são ditos "denumeráveis" ou "contabilizáveis".</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1847, o inventor escocês-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Graham_Bell">Alexander Graham Bell</a>. Ele é o inventor do telefone. A carreira de Bell foi influenciada pelo seu avô (que publicou The Practical Elocutionist and Stammering and Other Impediments of Speech), pelo seu pai (cujo interesse era a mecânica e os métodos de comunicação vocal) e pela sua mãe (que era surda). Quando adolescente, Alexandre ficou intrigado com os escritos do físico alemão Hermann Von Helmholtz, On The Sensations of Tone. Aos 23 anos, mudou-se para o Canadá. Em 1871, Bell começou a dar instrução em Discurso Visível na Escola para Surdos Mudos de Boston. Este contexto estabeleceu o seu curso no desenvolvimento da transmissão de voz sobre fios. Co-fundou a Bell Telephone Co em 1877. Com o seu sogro, restabeleceu a revista Science (1882)".</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1879, o bioquímico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmer_McCollum">Elmer McCollum</a>. Ele criou o sistema de letras de vitaminas. Descobriu as vitaminas A, B e trabalhou com outros sobre a vitamina D. Realizou um extenso trabalho de investigação em nutrição e crescimento. Foi o primeiro nos Estados Unidos a estabelecer uma colónia de ratos brancos como animais de laboratório a ser objecto das suas experiências nutricionais. Nos anos 1910, reconheceu que uma dieta saudável exigia certas gorduras, e nomeou o componente essencial "lipossolúvel A", por oposição a outro que nomeou "hidrossolúvel B". Embora no início pensasse que cada um era um único composto, mais tarde mostrou que eram de facto complexos. Investigou como certos minerais eram importantes como nutrientes, incluindo cálcio, fósforo, flúor, manganês e zinco.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1898, o matemático austro-alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Artin">Emil Artin</a>. Ele trabalhou na teoria do número algébrico, deu uma grande contribuição para a teoria de campo, e declarou uma lei de reciprocidade que incluía todas as leis de reciprocidade anteriormente conhecidas (1927). Trabalhou também na teoria das tranças (1925), e em anéis com a condição mínima sobre ideais certos, agora chamados anéis Artinianos (1944). Artin tem a distinção de resolver (1927) um dos famosos 23 problemas anteriormente colocados por Hilbert em 1900.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1918, o bioquímico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Kornberg">Arthur Kornberg</a>. Ele partilhou o Prémio Nobel da Fisiologia ou Medicina de 1959 (com Severo Ochoa) pela "descoberta dos mecanismos na síntese biológica do ácido desoxirribonucleico" Kornberg mostrou não só como as moléculas de ADN são duplicadas tanto na natureza dentro das células bacterianas, mas também isolou a primeira enzima polimerizadora de ADN (1958), e reproduziu o processo no tubo de ensaio. A sua investigação incluiu o estudo dos ácidos nucleicos que controlam a hereditariedade em animais, plantas, bactérias e vírus".</p>

<p>A 3 de Março de 1969 era lançada a Apollo 9. Voando em órbita terrestre baixa, foi a segunda missão Apollo tripulada que os Estados Unidos lançaram através de um foguete Saturn V, e foi o primeiro voo da nave espacial Apollo completa: o módulo de comando e serviço (CSM) com o Módulo Lunar (LM). A missão foi pilotada para qualificar o LM para operações de órbita lunar em preparação para a primeira aterragem lunar, demonstrando os seus sistemas de propulsão de descida e subida, mostrando que a sua tripulação podia pilotá-lo de forma independente, e depois encontrar-se e atracar novamente com o CSM, como seria necessário para a primeira aterragem lunar da tripulação. Outros objectivos do voo incluíram o disparo do motor de descida LM para impulsionar a pilha da nave espacial como modo de apoio (como seria exigido na missão Apollo 13), e a utilização da mochila do sistema portátil de suporte de vida fora da cabine LM. A missão foi um sucesso completo.</p>

<p>Foi também nesta data, em 2005 que o Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer terminou o primeiro voo de circunavegação em 2 dias, 19 horas, 1 minuto e 46 segundos. A partir de 2019, esta é a viagem mundial mais rápida da sua classe a uma velocidade de 550,78 km/h. A distância voada foi determinada em 36.912 quilómetros (22.936 mi), apenas 125 quilómetros (78 mi) acima da distância mínima exigida. Tratou-se do primeiro voo de circunavegação sem paragens solo.</p>

<p><em>"A design quirk in the X-ray observatory has made it possible for astronomers to use previously unwanted light to study even more cosmic objects than before. For almost 10 years, NASA’s NuSTAR (Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array) X-ray space observatory has been studying some of the highest-energy objects in the universe, such as colliding dead stars and enormous black holes feasting on hot gas. During that time, scientists have had to deal with stray light leaking in through the sides of the observatory, which can interfere with observations much like external noise can drown out a phone call. But now team members have figured out how to use that stray X-ray light to learn about objects in NuSTAR’s peripheral vision while also performing normal targeted observations. This development has the potential to multiply the insights that NuSTAR provides. A new science paper in the Astrophysical Journal describes the first use of NuSTAR’s stray light observations to learn about a cosmic object – in this case, a neutron star."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-nustar-makes-illuminating-discoveries-with-nuisance-light">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/opinion/fostering-chiplet-ecosystem-future-moores-law.html">Fostering a Chiplet Ecosystem for the Future of Moore’s Law</a></h2>

<p><em>"To satisfy the ever-increasing demand for more computing power, Intel and many of our colleagues in the semiconductor industry have come to the same conclusion: The future of chip innovation lies in moving to modular designs based on “chiplet” building blocks, essentially moving from system-on-chip (SoC) to System-on-Package (SoP) chip architectures. The feasibility of implementing complex systems on monolithic dies is reaching its physical and economic limits. Gordon Moore predicted this “Day of Reckoning” in his seminal 1965 white paper, “Cramming More Components Onto Integrated Circuits,” writing that as chip density and complexity progressed, eventually “it may prove to be more economical to build large systems out of smaller functions, which are separately packaged and interconnected.” The industry’s increasing adoption of modular semiconductor design takes us into the realm of SoP, giving architects incredible flexibility to mix and match the best IP and process technologies for any given product. Intel has been shipping chiplet-based designs since 2016 with Intel® Stratix®10 FPGAs. Modular design is also a key component of our IDM 2.0 strategy as we use internal and external foundry resources to build our products while offering our foundry services to the industry. Later this year, our customers will see our next-generation tile-based processors in the Sapphire Rapids and Ponte Vecchio SoCs."</em> <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/opinion/fostering-chiplet-ecosystem-future-moores-law.html">[...]</a>

The results, published Feb. 23 in Science Advances, are not likely to become transistors or computers right away, but the technique could point the way towards devices with new functions in sensing, computing and robotics. “We showed you can create the elementary building blocks of a circuit—gates, amplifiers, and conductors—which means you should be able to assemble them into arrangements capable of performing more complex operations,” said Juan de Pablo, the Liew Family Professor in Molecular Engineering and senior scientist at Argonne National Laboratory, and the senior corresponding author on the paper. “It’s a really exciting step for the field of active materials.” The details in the defects The research aimed to take a closer look at a type of material called a liquid crystal. The molecules in a liquid crystal tend to be elongated, and when packed together they adopt a structure that has some order, like the straight rows of atoms in a diamond crystal—but instead of being stuck in place as in a solid, this structure can also shift around as a liquid does.

It is suited for many applications as listed below. A single input pin on the LT1158 synchronously controls two N-channel power MOSFETs IRF3710 in a totem pole configuration. Unique adaptive protection against shoot-through currents eliminates all matching requirements for the two MOSFETs. This greatly eases the design of high-efficiency motor control and switching regulator systems."</em> <a href="https://www.electronics-lab.com/project/high-current-half-bridge-with-over-current-shutdown/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"3D printing is very exciting technology as it reaches the home scale but using brand new filament was not acceptable to me as it would just increases the plastic waste amount on the planet. I started to look for a way to turn plastic scraps around me into usable 3D printer filament... On the web I could find many plastic extruders and recyclers but they exceeded my budget so I decided to build my own process. My current system costs less than 100 with half of the parts taken from scrap. The process consists in sorting and cleaning plastic pieces taken from defective household appliances, grinding them to small granules, and feed those granules to a home made small extrusion line. After a quick post-processing step, the output filament can be used by a 3D printer to print new objects. All my work is widely inspired by others projects on the web : Filastruder, Lyman filament extruder, Precious Plastic project and various YouTube or instructables.com contributions."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Recycle-Plastic-Into-3D-Printer-Filament-at-Home/">[...]</a>

As a basic rule of thumb, a lithium battery should be charged at the rate of 0.5C to 1C. In this article/video, I have introduced a universal double lithium battery charger that the charging current (C rate) can be adjusted simply by changing a resistor value. You just need a 5V power source (such as a mobile charger) and a USB Type-C cable. To design the schematic and PC, I used Altium Designer 22 and the SamacSys component libraries (Altium Plugin)."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/hesam-moshiri/double-lithium-ion-lithium-polymer-usb-type-c-charger-d417c6">[...]</a>

To make the experiment simpler, the system is designed to recognize only two gestures: a punch and a flex movement (in the data science field, a binary classification). The biggest challenge of this experiment is trying to run the prediction model on a very tiny device: an 8-bit microcontroller. To achieve this, you can use Neuton. Neuton is a TinyML framework.
