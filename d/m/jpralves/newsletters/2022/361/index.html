<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1596, o filósofo e matemático francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes">René Descartes</a>. Ele é conhecido como "o pai da filosofia moderna". A sua obra, La géométrie, inclui a sua aplicação da álgebra à geometria, da qual temos agora a geometria cartesiana. Durante 1620-28, Descartes viajou pela Europa, estabelecendo-se depois na Holanda. Pouco depois, começou a trabalhar no seu primeiro grande tratado sobre física, Le Monde, ou Traité de la Lumière. Este trabalho estava quase concluído quando lhe chegou a notícia de que Galileu estava condenado a prisão domiciliária. Ele decidiu não publicar essa obra durante a sua vida. Mais tarde, recorreu à filosofia, uma das primeiras a opor-se ao aristotelismo escolástico, começou por duvidar metodicamente dos conhecimentos baseados na autoridade, nos sentidos e na razão. A sua citação mais famosa é "Penso, logo existo".</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1831, o químico escocês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archibald_Scott_Couper">Archibald Scott Couper</a>. Ele, independentemente de August Kekulé, propôs a tetravalência do carbono e a capacidade dos átomos de carbono de se ligarem uns aos outros para formar longas cadeias, conceitos fundamentais para compreender as moléculas encontradas nos organismos vivos. Também criou a utilização de uma linha entre símbolos de elementos para indicar uma ligação química. Escreveu estas ideias marcantes num artigo a ser submetido à Academia Francesa de Ciências através do seu superior, Adolphe Wurtz. Infelizmente para Couper, esse trabalho não foi enviado do laboratório em tempo útil, e entretanto outro químico, August Kekulé tinha publicado a mesma ideia, embora independente, de tetravalência, privando Couper da sua devida fama.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1854, o inventor escocês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugald_Clerk">Dugald Clerk</a>. Ele criou o motor de motociclos de dois tempos, amplamente utilizado em motociclos ligeiros e outras pequenas máquinas. Em 1881 patenteou um motor que construiu em 1876 para funcionar com vapor de hidrocarboneto que utilizava uma explosão a cada dois tempos do pistão em vez de uma explosão a cada dois tempos do ciclo Otto mais comum utilizado pela maioria dos motores de automóveis. Numa outra direcção de investigação importante, estudou as propriedades do combustível gasoso e as suas aplicações de aquecimento e iluminação. O Almirantado britânico nomeou-o director da investigação de engenharia em 1916, seguido do seu cavaleiro em 1917. O seu trabalho aparece nos dois volumes de The Gas, Petrol, e Oil Engine.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1890, o físico australiano-inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lawrence_Bragg">William Lawrence Bragg</a>. Ele, aos 25 anos de idade, partilhou o Prémio Nobel da Física em 1915 (com o seu pai, Sir William Bragg). Lawrence Bragg formulou a lei Bragg da difracção de raios X, que é fundamental para a determinação da estrutura cristalina: nλ = 2dsinθ que relaciona o comprimento de onda dos raios X, λ, o ângulo de incidência num cristal, θ, e o espaçamento dos planos de cristal, d, para a difracção de raios X, onde n é um número inteiro (1, 2, 3, etc.). Em conjunto, os Braggs trabalharam as estruturas cristalinas de uma série de substâncias. No início deste trabalho, mostraram que o cloreto de sódio não tem moléculas individuais no sólido, mas é um conjunto de iões de sódio e cloreto.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1906, o físico japonês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin%27ichir%C5%8D_Tomonaga">Shin'ichirō Tomonaga</a>. Ele partilhou o Prémio Nobel da Física em 1965 (com Richard P. Feynman e Julian S. Schwinger dos EUA) por desenvolver independentemente princípios básicos de electrodinâmica quântica. Foi um dos primeiros a aplicar a teoria quântica às partículas subatómicas com energias muito elevadas. Tomonaga começou com uma análise do acoplamento intermédio - a ideia de que as interacções entre duas partículas ocorrem através da troca de uma terceira (partícula virtual), como um navio que afecta o outro ao disparar uma bala de canhão. Ele utilizou este conceito para desenvolver uma teoria quântica de campo (1941-43) que era consistente com a teoria da relatividade especial. A Segunda Guerra Mundial atrasou as notícias do seu trabalho. Entretanto, Feynman e Schwinger publicaram as suas próprias soluções independentes.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1934, o físico italiano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Rubbia">Carlo Rubbia</a>. Ele foi responsável pela descoberta da partícula W subatómica maciça e de curta duração e da partícula Z. Por volta de 1960, juntou-se ao recém fundado CERN, onde investigou a estrutura das interacções fracas. Em 1976, sugeriu a adaptação do Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) do CERN para colidir protões e antiprotões no mesmo anel e a primeira fábrica mundial de antiprotões foi construída, e começou a funcionar em 1981. Em Janeiro de 1983, veio o anúncio, primeiro a partir do detector UA1, de que as partículas W tinham sido criadas. Alguns meses mais tarde, as partículas Z ainda mais esquivas foram também observadas. Estas partículas são os portadores da chamada força fraca envolvida na decadência radioactiva dos núcleos atómicos.</p>

<p>Em 1889, a Torre Eiffel, Paris, França, foi inaugurada, tornando-se a torre mais alta do mundo da sua época. Com uma altura de 300 m, continuou a ser a estrutura mais alta do mundo até ser ultrapassada pelo Empire State Building, 40 anos mais tarde. O designer Gustave Eiffel, 56 anos, celebrou desfraldando uma bandeira francesa no topo da torre. O imenso desenho das treliças de ferro foi escolhido por unanimidade entre 700 propostas apresentadas num concurso. A construção decorreu entre 26 de Janeiro de 1887 e 31 de Março de 1889, utilizando 300 trabalhadores siderúrgicos. Foi erguida para a Exposição de Paris de 1889, que contou com 1.968.287 visitantes. Os elevadores eram alimentados por maquinaria nos porões dos pilares oriental e ocidental.</p>

<h2><a href="https://toshiba.semicon-storage.com/ap-en/company/news/news-topics/2022/03/mosfet-20220331-1.html">Toshiba Releases 150V N-channel Power MOSFET that Uses Latest Generation Process to Improve Power Supply Efficiency</a></h2>

<p><em>"Toshiba Electronic Devices &amp; Storage Corporation ("Toshiba") has launched a 150V N-channel power MOSFET “TPH9R00CQH” that uses the latest generation process, “U-MOSX-H,” and that is suitable for use in switching power supplies for industrial equipment—including those deployed in data centers and communications base stations. Shipments start today. TPH9R00CQH has a drain-source On-resistance about 42% lower than TPH1500CNH, a 150V product that uses the current generation process, U-MOSⅧ-H. Optimization of the new MOSFET’s structure has improved the trade-off between the drain-source On-resistance and two charge characteristics, realizing excellent low-loss characteristics. In addition, spike voltage between the drain and source at switching operation is reduced, helping to lower electromagnetic interference (EMI) in switching power supplies. Two types of surface mount packages are available: SOP Advance and the more popular SOP Advance(N). Toshiba also offers tools that support circuit design for switching power supplies."</em> <a href="https://toshiba.semicon-storage.com/ap-en/company/news/news-topics/2022/03/mosfet-20220331-1.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A New Shepard vehicle lifted off from Blue Origin's Launch Site One in West Texas on Thursday (March 31) at 9:58 a.m. EDT (1358 GMT), carrying a crew of six people to suborbital space. Just about 10 minutes later, those folks came back down to Earth, their capsule raising a plume of dust as it touched down in the desert. "It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen," passenger Sharon Hagle said on exiting the capsule. Their mission was called NS-20, because it was the 20th spaceflight of a New Shepard vehicle. But it was just the fourth crewed Blue Origin flight, and the first that didn't feature a celebrity passenger. The first crewed New Shepard mission sent Blue Origin founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, aviation pioneer Wally Funk and two other people to the final frontier on July 20, 2021."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/blue-origin-space-tourism-launch-ns-20">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A team co-led team by the University of Surrey has successfully increased the levels of energy absorbed by wafer-thin photovoltaic panels by 25%. Their solar panels, just one micrometre thick (1μm), convert light into electricity more efficiently than others as thin and pave the way to make it easier to general more clean, green energy. In a paper published in the American Chemical Society’s Photonics journal, the team detail how they used characteristics of sunlight to design a disordered honeycomb layer which lies on top of a wafer of silicon. Their approach is echoed in nature in the design of butterfly wings and bird eyes. The innovative honeycomb design enables light absorption from any angle and traps light inside the solar cell, enabling more energy to be generated. The team of researchers from the University of Surrey and Imperial College London worked with experimental collaborators at AMOLF in Amsterdam to design, model and create the new ultra-thin photovoltaic."</em> <a href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk/news/scientists-achieve-record-efficiency-ultra-thin-solar-panels">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://discover.lanl.gov/news/0330-assess">Using ‘ASSESS’ to detect subtle flaws in structures and materials</a></h2>

<p><em>"A new technology could make rocket launches more successful When it comes to materials, engineers are always looking for something better. There is a constant need for stronger, lighter and easier-to-produce materials that can withstand harsh environments. This is particularly true for aerospace applications.

Whether a material is weak or strong, ductile or brittle, however, is not determined simply by the crystal grains that make up the material, but rather by what happens in the space between them known as the grain boundary. Despite decades of investigation, atomic-level deformation processes at the grain boundary remain elusive, along with the secret to making new and better materials. Using advanced microscopy coupled with novel computer simulations that track atomic movement, researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology conducted real-time atomic-level observations of grain boundary deformation in poly-grained metallic materials called polycrystalline materials. The team observed previously unrecognized processes that affect material properties, such as atoms that hop from one plane to another across a grain boundary. Their work, published in Science this March, pushes the limits of atomic-level probing, and enables a deeper understanding of how polycrystalline materials deform."</em> <a href="https://research.gatech.edu/tracking-real-time-atomic-movement-between-crystal-grains-metals">[...]</a>

The stepper motors should make for a smoother and more precise axis movement in theory which is needed to navigate the steel ball through the course, the whole idea of a game of skill is that it can be achieved, a lot I have seen are nearly impossible to complete, so some thought must be given to the layout and the route the ball must take to achieve this goal. I will be using some left over spruce boards from a garden bench build and an off cut of 10mm Mdf for the playing area, the base will be 3mm ply For everything to work correctly the woodworking may be beyond my skills, I'm not that precise but with this type of build, everything has to be precise especially with Axis movement.

<p><em>"MyBroadband successfully played Doom ported to a Raspberry Pi Pico using guidelines provided by Graham Sanderson, also known as Kilograham. The Raspberry Pi Pico is a microcontroller with a dual-core ARM Cortex-M0+ processor, 264KB of RAM, and 2MB of flash storage. The device costs R69.90 in South Africa. With only 2MB of storage, most people assume using the Raspberry Pi Pico for gaming is impossible. They are wrong. Graham managed to recompress the shareware version of Doom and everything needed to make it run on the Pico into the 2MB of storage."</em> <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/hardware/438986-we-played-doom-on-a-r70-raspberry-pi-pico-with-only-2mb-of-storage.html">[...]</a>

It may be considered a fairly sensitive configuration when used with quality RF power amplifier transistors, trimmers and inductors. It involves a power amplification factor of 9 to 12 dB (9 to 15 times). At an input power of 0.1W the output may be well over 1W. It's advisable to choose T1 transistor on the basis of the input voltage. For 12V voltage it is recommended to use transistors such as 2N4427, KT920A, KT934A, KT904, BLX65, 2SC1970, BLY87."</em> <a href="http://electronics-diy.com/electronic_schematic.php?id=1391">[...]</a>

In this project, I focused on developing an AI-driven budget-friendly device to collect water quality data from various water resources in the field and forecast water pollution levels based on oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), and turbidity measurements. Why is water pollution a global issue? Since we incessantly pollute our limited water resources, which are already drowning in chemicals, waste, plastic, and other contaminants, it is crucial to eschew water pollution before it is too late for relieving the plight of people lacking safe drinking water. Although there are international efforts and campaigns to plummet water contaminants, it is yet a pressing issue to track water pollution levels locally to get prescient warnings regarding possible health and environmental risks. In addition to threatening terrestrial animals, plants, and marine life, water pollution is jeopardizing our health."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/kutluhan-aktar/gsm-sms-enabled-ai-driven-tinyml-water-pollution-monitor-4a06e6">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Measuring a body temperature using contactless sensor When debugging an electronics circuit or testing a new hardware design, often times I tend to check if the components on the board are getting hot abnormally by touching them. And if something is messed up (which usually is in the first try) these components could get as hot as 80°C or more burning not only the component but also my finger along with it. After burning my fingers for more times than I could remember I decided to build my own Temperature Gun using Arduino and an Infrared Temperature Sensor. This Thermal gun will be built using a non-contact temperature sensor called MLX90614; hence it can not only be used to measure component temperatures but can also be used for measuring body temperature, surface temperature, Heat ventilation and much more. Of course, these thermal guns are readily available in the market from renowned manufacturers like Fluke, Flir etc. But they are not light on your pockets and on top of that what is more fun than building your own gadgets."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/ey5/contactless-temperature-measuring-using-mlx90614-ir-5686a4">[...]</a>
