<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1765, o inventor, engenheiro mecânico e fabricante norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Whitney">Eli Whitney</a>. Ele inventou o motor do algodão e desenvolveu a ideia e métodos para a produção em massa de peças intercambiáveis. O descaroçador de algodão é uma máquina que separa a fibra de algodão das sementes. O dispositivo, patenteado em 1793, estimulou grandemente o cultivo do algodão no sul dos EUA. Whitney virou-se subsequentemente para o fabrico de armas de fogo, no qual introduziu a noção de peças permutáveis. Isto ele aplicou no cumprimento de um contrato do governo dos EUA (1797) para o fornecimento de mosquetes. Whitney fabricou-os em peças padronizadas para remontagem, o que significa que, pela primeira vez, as peças desgastadas podiam ser substituídas por peças sobressalentes, em vez de requererem substituições especiais.</p>

<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1865, o matemático francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Hadamard">Jacques-Salomon Hadamard</a>. Ele provou o teorema do número primo (como n se aproxima do infinito, o limite do rácio de (n) e n/ln n é 1, onde (n) é o número de números primos positivos não superior a n). Conjugado no século XVIII, este teorema não foi provado até 1896, quando Hadamard e também Charles de la Vallée Poussin, utilizaram análises complexas. O trabalho de Hadamard inclui a teoria das funções integrais e singularidades das funções representadas pela série Taylor. O seu trabalho sobre as equações diferenciais parciais da física matemática é importante. Introduziu o conceito de um valor inicial bem posicionado e de um problema de valor limite. Ao considerar problemas de valor limite, introduziu uma generalização das funções de Green (1932).</p>

<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1947, o bioquímico e biólogo molecular americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Cech">Thomas Cech</a>. Ele, com Sidney Altman, recebeu o Prémio Nobel da Química de 1989 pelas suas descobertas sobre o ARN (ácido ribonucleico). Antes da investigação de Cech sobre o ARN, a maioria dos cientistas acreditava que as proteínas eram os únicos catalizadores em células vivas. As descobertas de Cech e Altman derrubaram a noção de que o ARN é meramente um mensageiro genético - um intermediário na síntese de proteínas a partir do ADN. Cech mostrou que o RNA poderia ter uma função catalítica independente, uma "ribozima", ajudando a uma reacção química sem ser consumido ou alterado. Esta descoberta teve grandes implicações para a engenharia genética, bem como para a compreensão de como surgiu a vida.</p>

<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1948, o físico teórico dinamarquês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per_Bak">Per Bak</a>. Ele cunhou o termo "crítica auto-organizada" num artigo de que foi co-autor (1987). Como ilustração, considere a pilha de areia cónica a crescer no fundo de uma ampulheta. Numerosas pequenas perturbações de grãos de areia individuais causam poucas mudanças, mas são pontuadas por deslizamentos de terra imprevisíveis. Mudanças críticas são impossíveis de prever exactamente no tempo, ou para o grão explícito. Embora desafiantes, tentar criar descrições matemáticas estende-se a terramotos, ou engarrafamentos, ou responder à forma como o universo de partículas fundamentais simples (tais como quarks e gluões) se reuniu em estruturas complexas como animais.</p>

<p>Em 1931, foi emitida uma patente americana pela primeira vez nos EUA para a invenção do cabo coaxial, descrita como um "sistema de condução concêntrica". Os inventores foram Lloyd Espenschied de Kew Gardens, N.Y. e Herman A. Affel de Ridgewood, N.J. A patente foi atribuída ao American Telegraph and Telephone Co. da cidade de Nova Iorque. (N.º 1.835.031). O pedido era de televisão, para a qual é necessária uma vasta gama de frequências de transmissão. Enquanto os requisitos de canais individuais para telegrafia são da ordem de algumas centenas de ciclos no máximo, e a telefonia talvez alguns milhares de ciclos, a televisão requer faixas de centenas de milhares de ciclos de largura para assegurar um grau razoável de detalhe de imagem. É utilizado um único par de condutores concêntricos.</p>

<p>Em 1994, aproximadamente um mês após ter anunciado a criação do elemento 110, uma equipa de cientistas alemães liderada por Peter Armbruster na Gesellschaft für schwerionenforschung (GSI) em Darmstadt, Alemanha, afirmou ter criado o elemento 111. O seu átomo tem 111 protões e 161 neutrões no seu núcleo, o que lhe dá um número de massa de 272. Como novo elemento, foi nomeado unununium, símbolo Uuu, de acordo com um sistema internacionalmente adoptado para a nomeação de novos elementos. Apenas três átomos do elemento foram feitos acelerando os átomos de níquel a alta velocidade e bombardeando-os em bismuto. Quando um átomo de cada um se fundiu para fazer o novo núcleo, este durou cerca de quatro milésimos de segundo antes de se decompor em núcleos mais pequenos. Mais tarde este elemento foi renomeado para Roentgenium. O seu nome vem do físico Wilhelm Röntgen (também soletrado Roentgen), que descobriu os raios X.</p>

<p><em>"The mission’s first two samples of regolith – broken rock and dust – could help scientists better understand the Red Planet and engineers prepare for future missions there. NASA’s Perseverance rover snagged two new samples from the Martian surface on Dec. 2 and 6. But unlike the 15 rock cores collected to date, these newest samples came from a pile of wind-blown sand and dust similar to but smaller than a dune. Now contained in special metal collection tubes, one of these two samples will be considered for deposit on the Martian surface sometime this month as part of the Mars Sample Return campaign. Scientists want to study Martian samples with powerful lab equipment on Earth to search for signs of ancient microbial life and to better understand the processes that have shaped the surface of Mars. Most of the samples will be rock; however, researchers also want to examine regolith – broken rock and dust – not only because of what it can teach us about geological processes and the environment on Mars, but also to mitigate some of the challenges astronauts will face on the Red Planet."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-perseverance-rover-gets-the-dirt-on-mars">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://news.skhynix.com/sk-hynix-develops-mcr-dimm/">SK hynix Develops MCR DIMM – World’s Fastest Server Memory Module</a></h2>

<p><em>"SK hynix Inc. (or “the company”, www.skhynix.com) announced today that it has developed working samples of DDR51 Multiplexer Combined Ranks2 (MCR) Dual In-line Memory Module, the world’s fastest server DRAM product. The new product has been confirmed to operate at the data rate of minimum 8Gbps, and at least 80% faster than 4.8Gbps of the existing DDR5 products. MCR DIMM is an achievement coming from out-of-the-box thinking with an aim to improve the operation speed of DDR5. Challenging the prevailing concept that the operation speed of DDR5 relies on that of DRAM chip itself, engineers sought to find a way to improve the speed of modules instead of chips for development of the latest product. SK hynix designed the product in a way that enables simultaneous operation of two ranks by utilizing the data buffer3 installed onto the MCR DIMM based on Intel’s MCR technology. By enabling simultaneous operation of two ranks, MCR DIMM allows transmission of 128 bytes of data to CPU at once, compared with 64 bytes fetched generally in conventional DRAM module."</em> <a href="https://news.skhynix.com/sk-hynix-develops-mcr-dimm/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Studying an atomic clock on-board a spacecraft inside the orbit of Mercury and very near to the Sun might be the trick to uncovering the nature of dark matter, suggests a new study published in Nature Astronomy. Dark matter makes up more than 80 per cent of mass in the universe, but it has so far evaded detection on Earth, despite decades of experimental efforts. A key component of these searches is an assumption about the local density of dark matter, which determines the number of dark matter particles passing through the detector at any given time, and therefore the experimental sensitivity. In some models, this density can be much higher than is usually assumed, and dark matter can become more concentrated in some regions compared to others. One important class of experimental searches are those using atoms or nuclei, because these have achieved incredible sensitivity to signals of dark matter. This is possible, in part, because when dark matter particles have very small masses, they induce oscillations in the very constants of nature."</em> <a href="https://www.ipmu.jp/en/20221206-quantumsensors">[...]</a>

In addition, the lifetimes can be tuned by making a simple alteration to the material's internal structure. The group, which included collaborators from Princeton University and Pennsylvania State University, demonstrated a new structure-property concept that imparts the ability to spatially localize electrons or holes within a core/shell heterostructure by tuning the charge carrier's kinetic energy on a parabolic potential energy surface. According to UIC chemist Preston Snee, this charge carrier separation results in extended radiative lifetimes and in continuous emission at the single-nanoparticle level.

Although sodium-sulphur (Na-S) batteries have existed for more than half a century, they have been an inferior alternative and their widespread use has been limited by low energy capacity and short life cycles. Using a simple pyrolysis process and carbon-based electrodes to improve the reactivity of sulphur and the reversibility of reactions between sulphur and sodium, the researchers' battery has shaken off its formerly sluggish reputation, exhibiting super-high capacity and ultra-long life at room temperature.

Recent astronomical observations, supported by theoretical modeling, reveal a new observational fingerprint of neutron-star mergers, which may shed light on the production of heavy elements throughout the universe. “Astronomers have long believed that gamma-ray bursts fell into two categories: long-duration bursts from imploding stars and short-duration bursts from merging compact stellar objects,” said Chris Fryer, an astrophysicist and Laboratory Fellow at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Fryer is coauthor and leader of the modeling team on a paper about the phenomenon published today in Nature. “But in a recently observed event, we've found a kilonova along with a long-duration gamma-ray burst, and that has thrown a wrench into this simple picture.” Hypernovae/supernovae are the visible-light, transient objects produced in these explosions from imploding objects, while kilonovae are visible-light transients produced by merging compact objects where at least one is a neutron star. Gamma-ray bursts can accompany both types of transients."</em> <a href="https://discover.lanl.gov/news/1207-gamma-ray-burst">[...]</a>

<p><em>"MIT-trained electrical engineer Jorg Scholvin guides researchers fabricating new technology at MIT.nano. Jorg Scholvin ’00, MEng ’01, PhD ’06 first set foot in a cleanroom midway through his undergraduate studies. It was the late 1990s and, as a computer science major, he’d registered for a fabrication class for a firsthand look at how a computer is assembled. “It’s amazing to see how it’s built,” he realized, “and to build it myself.” By the end of the semester, Scholvin had shifted his focus toward electrical engineering and went on to spend several years at MIT developing his fabrication skills. Now, he guides others through all the possibilities of the cleanroom as an assistant director at MIT.nano, the Institute’s center for nanoscale science and engineering. Originally from Germany, Scholvin has made MIT his home base for more than 25 years, minus a brief interlude in finance."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/all-possibilities-cleanroom-1208">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In some materials, the molecules line up in a regular, repeating pattern. In others, they all point in random directions. But in many advanced materials used in medicine, computer chip manufacturing and other industries, the molecules arrange themselves in complex patterns that dictate the material’s properties. Scientists haven’t had good ways to measure molecular orientation in three dimensions at a microscopic scale, leaving them in the dark about why some materials behave the way they do. Now, researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have measured the 3D orientation of the molecular building blocks of plastics, called polymers, observing details as small as 400 nanometers, or billionths of a meter, in size. The measurements, described in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, show polymer chains twisting and undulating in complex and unexpected ways."</em> <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/12/molecules-have-orientation-and-scientists-have-new-way-measure-it">[...]</a>

Combine this with his devotion to the tenkey pad on a full-size keyboard and the fact that I happened to have an old rotary dial in my bin of spare parts, and the path forward for this year’s April Fool’s prank was self-evident. I mean, of course, that buying a cheap $13 mechanical keyboard off eBay and hacking the rotary dial into it was the most reasonable course of action. Firmware While the easy route out with a fabrication project like this is just to go for cosmetic completeness, I figured that it was imperative that the dial actually work for numeric input - especially since I was planning to remove the number row as well, thus forcing the use of the rotary dial for numeric or symbolic entry. My rotary dial has two primary pairs of contacts. One goes open when the dial is moved past the 1 position, and the other creates the characteristic pulse train upon release (one pulse per numeric position)."</em> <a href="https://squidgeefish.com/projects/rotary-keyboard/">[...]</a>

Supplies - Arduino Nano - 60 LEDs/Meter Neopixel LED strip with 15LEDs (25cm)."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/3D-Printed-Chistmas-Tree-Lamp/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The CMOS series of integrated circuits appeared shortly after the TTL series. This means that at the beginning of the 70s it was available on the market in an accessible way for any user. Hence the nostalgia of those who used these circuits and who remember those years. Today, these integrated circuits are considered outdated, but building a device that uses them can bring back pleasant memories, can bring back into use components that would otherwise constitute electronic waste, and last but not least, a useful device could be obtained in the electronics technician's laboratory. The HCMOS series appeared on the market a little later and had, in addition to CMOS (low consumption and higher degree of integration compared to TTL), an increased working speed. The latter can be used at over 60 MHz."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Nostalgic-CMOS-Frequency-Meter/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Extending from the idea of my previous post Joystick Module Calibration and Press Detection, this post is an attempt to futher ehnance the code to implement wireless Joystick support over ESP-Now communication protocol, which is built-in to ESP microcontroller boards. Two ESP microcontroller boards are need. One as server, which will have physical Joystick module attached. One as client, which will be receiving Joystick signals (ESP-Now packets) from the server, to realize wireless "virtual" Joystick. Here, I will only use ESP8266 microcontroller boards -- ESP01 board and ESP8266 board (NodeMCU). Of cause, the ESP-Now communication protocol doesn't require that the boards be the same type, and therefore can be ESP32."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Wireless-Joystick-Module-Experiment-With-ESP8266-o/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This is second hardware revision for Programmable Keypad project I made some time ago. General concept and code for this project has not changed. So please check original post for this project if you want to get better understanding about it. In a nutshell this device is a Keypad which uses Arduino Pro Micro as keyboard emulator. Each button sends key press combination over USB which is mapped to some particular action on operating system. "</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Programmable-Keypad-Rev-B/">[...]</a>

I have a great interest in modern digital fabrication technologies such as 3D printing &amp; CNC machines. The Pizza-Pizza CNC Machine is a Marlin-based three-axis CNC I developed alongside three of my friends. My contributions to the project include the gantry, electronic housing, and parts of the frame CAD, as well as the machine's electronics system, firmware, and pizza-preparing gcode."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Pizza-Pizza-CNC-Machine/">[...]</a>
