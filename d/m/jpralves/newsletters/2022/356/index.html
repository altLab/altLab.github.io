<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1663, o Engenheiro e inventor inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Newcomen">Thomas Newcomen</a>. Ele é o inventor da primeira máquina a vapor atmosférica bem sucedida do mundo. A sua invenção c.1711 entrou em uso até 1725 para bombear água das minas de carvão ou elevar a água para alimentar as rodas d'água. Em cada volta, o vapor enchia um cilindro fechado por um pistão, depois um jacto de água arrefecia e condensava o vapor no cilindro criando um vácuo, depois a pressão atmosférica empurrava o pistão para baixo. Um feixe transversal transferiu o movimento do pistão para o funcionamento da bomba. Isto foi um desperdício de combustível necessário para reaquecer o cilindro para o próximo curso. Apesar de lento e ineficiente, o motor da Newcomen foi utilizado durante os primeiros 60 anos da nova era do vapor que começou, talvez a invenção mais importante da Revolução Industrial.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1709, o inventor francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_de_Vaucanson">Jacques de Vaucanson</a>. Ele foi o inventor de autómatos - dispositivos robotizados de significado posterior para a indústria moderna. Em 1737-38, produziu um tocador de flauta transversal, um tocador de tubo e de tambor, e um pato mecânico, que foi especialmente notável, não só imitando os movimentos de um pato vivo, mas também os movimentos de beber, comer, e "digerir". Fez melhorias na mecanização da tecelagem da seda, mas a sua invenção mais importante foi ignorada durante várias décadas - a de automatizar o tear por meio de cartões perfurados que guiavam os ganchos ligados aos fios de urdidura. (Mais tarde reconstruída e melhorada por J.-M. Jacquard, tornou-se uma das invenções mais importantes da Revolução Industrial).</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1841, o engenheiro irlandês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Philip_Holland">John Philip Holland</a>. Ele ficou conhecido como o "pai do submarino moderno", que concebeu e construiu o primeiro navio subaquático aceite pela Marinha dos Estados Unidos. Em 1873, emigrou para os EUA onde, com o apoio financeiro da Irish Fenian Society (que esperava utilizar submarinos contra a Inglaterra), construiu o Fenian Ram, um pequeno submarino que se revelou um sucesso limitado numa corrida de ensaio. Em 1895, a sua J.P. Holland Torpedo Boat Company recebeu um contrato da Marinha dos EUA para construir um submarino, e em 1898 foi lançado um submarino bem sucedido da Holanda, o primeiro submarino verdadeiramente prático. O governo dos EUA encomendou mais seis; encomendas semelhantes vieram de Inglaterra, Japão, e Rússia.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1946, o matemático russo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigory_Margulis">Grigory Margulis</a>. Ele recebeu a Medalha Fields em 1978 pelas suas contribuições para a teoria dos grupos Lie, embora não tenha sido autorizado pelo governo soviético a viajar para a Finlândia para receber o prémio. Em 1990, Margulis imigrou para os Estados Unidos. O trabalho de Margulis esteve largamente envolvido na resolução de uma série de problemas na teoria dos grupos Lie. Em particular, Margulis provou ser uma conjectura de longa data de Atle Selberg sobre subgrupos discretos de grupos Lie semi-simples. As técnicas que utilizou no seu trabalho foram extraídas de combinatórias, teoria ergódica, sistemas dinâmicos, e geometria diferencial.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1955, o inventor e empresário norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs">Steve Jobs</a>. Ele, em 1976, co-fundou a Apple Inc. com Steve Wozniak para fabricar computadores pessoais. Durante a sua vida, foi-lhe concedido ou solicitado 338 patentes como inventor ou co-inventor não só de aplicações em computadores, dispositivos electrónicos portáteis e interfaces de utilizador, mas também de uma série de outras numa gama de tecnologias. Desde o início, esteve activo em todos os aspectos da empresa Apple, concebendo, desenvolvendo e comercializando. Após o sucesso inicial da série Apple II de computadores pessoais, o Macintosh substituiu-a com uma interface gráfica movida a rato. Ele  manteve a Apple na vanguarda do design inovador, funcional e de fácil utilização com novos produtos, incluindo o tablet iPad e o iPhone. Ele também esteve envolvido com filmes de computação gráfica através da sua compra (1986) da empresa que se tornou Pixar.</p>

<p>Faz hoje 10 anos que era lançado para o mercado o Raspberry Pi. Desde então, tornou-se um fenómeno mundial, alimentando uma vasta gama de projectos hobby e de produtos comerciais. Desenvolvido na Inglaterra pela fundação Raspberry PI em associação com a Fabricante de Chips Broadcom o objectivo inicial desta placa era a promoção do ensino de ciência da computação básica em escolas de países em desenvolvimento. A versão originalmente lançada foi o Raspberry Pi 1 B com 256MB de memória RAM e tinha um custo de 35 USD.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker e alguns vídeos interessantes. É apresentada a revista MagPI Magazine Nº 115 de Março.</p>

<p><em>"The rover has racked up a series of accomplishments, including new distance records, as it reaches the end of the first of several planned science campaigns on the Red Planet. NASA’s Perseverance rover has notched up a slew of firsts since touching down on Mars one year ago, on Feb. 18, 2021, and the six-wheeled scientist has other important accomplishments in store as it speeds toward its new destination and a new science campaign. Weighing roughly 1 ton (1,025 kilograms), Perseverance is the heaviest rover ever to touch down on Mars, returning dramatic video of its landing. The rover collected the first rock core samples from another planet (it’s carrying six so far), served as an indispensable base station for Ingenuity, the first helicopter on Mars, and tested MOXIE (Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment), the first prototype oxygen generator on the Red Planet. Perseverance also recently broke a record for the most distance driven by a Mars rover in a single day, traveling almost 1,050 feet (320 meters) on Feb. 14, 2022, the 351st Martian day, or sol, of the mission. And it performed the entire drive using AutoNav, the self-driving software that allows Perseverance to find its own path around rocks and other obstacles."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-perseverance-celebrates-first-year-on-mars-by-learning-to-run">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Advanced Driver Assist Systems (ADAS) have grown from a premium vehicle feature to a capability consumers now expect as standard in new vehicles. In parallel, the global chip shortage is making it clear to the automotive industry the criticality of silicon and electronics to the development and competitive positioning of its products. Drivers increasingly depend on ADAS applications such as collision avoidance, lane departure warnings and automated emergency braking, and vehicles increasingly rely on cameras positioned around the car to enable many of these features. Indeed, according to a recent report from Strategy Analytics the value of the automotive camera market is expected to grow by greater than 19% from 2020 to 2025, making it the most important sensor type in providing data needed for the vehicle to make decisions about its surroundings. As the number and sophistication of vehicle cameras increases, so does the compute power needed to translate the high throughput of image data – efficiently and safely – into outputs that meet the varying requirements for machine and human vision. To enable new capabilities in ADAS and autonomous driving, the industry will need a new approach to image processing, and to address this, we have added the Mali-C78AE ISP to our portfolio of IP specifically developed to meet the performance and safety needs of automotive applications."</em> <a href="https://www.arm.com/company/news/2022/02/arm-adds-new-isp-to-advance-adoption-of-adas-and-automation-technologies">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Announced at ISSCC 2022: Impedance Tuning and Reference Signal Self-Correction Technologies Can Facilitate Bluetooth LE Implementation in IoT Devices. Renesas Electronics Corporation (TSE:6723), a premier supplier of advanced semiconductor solutions, today announced the development of two 2.4 GHz RF transceiver technologies that support the Bluetooth® Low Energy (LE) low-power, near-field communication standard. The new technologies also achieve a smaller mounting area and better power efficiency. Renesas presented these technologies at International Solid-State Circuits Conference 2022 (ISSCC 2022), held between February 20 and 24 in San Francisco. In addition to being compact, low cost, and power efficient, IoT devices must provide flexible support for Bluetooth LE regardless of their implementation format. Renesas has developed two new technologies to address these requirements: 1) a matching circuit technology that covers a wide impedance range and enables the IC to match a variety of antenna and board impedances without an external impedance-matching circuit; 2) a signal correction technology for locally generated reference signals that uses a small circuit to self correct inconsistencies in the circuit elements and variations in surrounding conditions without calibration."</em> <a href="https://www.renesas.com/eu/en/about/press-room/renesas-develops-bluetooth-low-energy-rf-transceiver-technologies-simplify-board-design-reduce">[...]</a>

The crux of the team’s discovery is that this new material is easily tunable. That is, it can be switched between two different states by changing the temperature. This means the material can work as an optical filter, absorbing different frequencies of light depending on whether it’s in a gelled state.

In hopes of making batteries that not only perform better than those currently used in EVs, but also are made from readily available materials, a group of Drexel University chemical engineers have found a way to introduce sulfur into lithium-ion batteries – with astounding results. With global sales of EVs more than doubling in 2021, prices of battery materials like lithium, nickel, manganese and cobalt surged and supply chains for these raw materials, most of which are sourced from other countries, became bottlenecked due to the pandemic. This also focused attention on the primary providers of the raw materials: countries like Congo and China; and raised questions about the human and environmental impact of extracting them from the earth. Well before the EV surge and battery material shortage, developing a commercially viable sulfur battery has been the battery industry’s sustainable, high-performing white whale.

Even better, entanglement leads to scalability, which solves the roadblock of exponentially increasing the size of the data in order to learn it,” said Andrew Sornborger, a computer scientist at Los Alamos and a coauthor of the paper published Feb. 18 in Physical Review Letters. “The theorem gives us hope that quantum neural networks are on track towards the goal of quantum speed-up, where eventually they will outperform their counterparts on classical computers.” The classical No-Free-Lunch theorem states that any machine-learning algorithm is as good as, but no better than, any other when their performance is averaged over all possible functions connecting the data to their labels."</em> <a href="https://discover.lanl.gov/news/0223-quantum-machine-learning">[...]</a>

However, the wide applications of QKD are curtailed by the channel loss since the encoded photons cannot be amplified or relayed via classical optical techniques to keep its security, which limits the increase of key rate and distance of QKD. A research team led by Academician Guo Guang-Can from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) extended the transmission distance of QKD to over 830 km optical fibers. They broke the record of 605 km achieved by researchers from Toshiba’s Cambridge Research Laboratory, and made an important step towards terrestrial quantum secure communication and networks over the scale of 1000 km.

<p><em>"Scientists identify a long-sought magnetic state predicted nearly 60 years ago Scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Brookhaven National Laboratory have discovered a long-predicted magnetic state of matter called an “antiferromagnetic excitonic insulator.” “Broadly speaking, this is a novel type of magnet,” said Brookhaven Lab physicist Mark Dean, senior author on a paper describing the research just published in Nature Communications. “Since magnetic materials lie at the heart of much of the technology around us, new types of magnets are both fundamentally fascinating and promising for future applications.” The new magnetic state involves strong magnetic attraction between electrons in a layered material that make the electrons want to arrange their magnetic moments, or “spins,” into a regular up-down “antiferromagnetic” pattern. The idea that such antiferromagnetism could be driven by quirky electron coupling in an insulating material was first predicted in the 1960s as physicists explored the differing properties of metals, semiconductors, and insulators. “Sixty years ago, physicists were just starting to consider how the rules of quantum mechanics apply to the electronic properties of materials,” said Daniel Mazzone, a former Brookhaven Lab physicist who led the study and is now at the Paul Scherrer Institut in Switzerland. “They were trying to work out what happens as you make the electronic ‘energy gap’ between an insulator and a conductor smaller and smaller. Do you just change a simple insulator into a simple metal where the electrons can move freely, or does something more interesting happen?” The prediction was that, under certain conditions, you could get something more interesting: namely, the “antiferromagnetic excitonic insulator” just discovered by the Brookhaven team."</em> <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=119438">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers and clinicians have been working to use focused ultrasound combined with microbubbles to open the blood-brain barrier (BBB) for both noninvasive diagnostic use as well as to deliver treatments to the brain for tumors and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the few existing devices for preclinical research are expensive, bulky and lack the precision needed for small animal research. Hong Chen, associate professor of biomedical engineering in the McKelvey School of Engineering and of radiation oncology in the School of Medicine at Washington University in St. Louis, and her team have developed a low-cost, easy-to-use and highly precise focused ultrasound (FUS) device that can be used on small animal models in preclinical research. The FUS transducer, created in-house using a 3D printer, costs about $80 to fabricate. It can be integrated with a commercially available stereotactic frame to precisely target a mouse brain. Results of the work were published online in IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering Feb. 15."</em> <a href="https://engineering.wustl.edu/news/2022/Low-cost-3D-printed-device-may-broaden-use-of-focused-ultrasound-technique.html">[...]</a>

In the mid-1990s, a few energy activists in Massachusetts had a vision: What if citizens had choice about the energy they consumed? Instead of being force-fed electricity sources selected by a utility company, what if cities, towns, and groups of individuals could purchase power that was cleaner and cheaper? The small group of activists — including a journalist, the head of a small nonprofit, a local county official, and a legislative aide — drafted model legislation along these lines that reached the state Senate in 1995.

One method that currently attracts a lot of interest is a combination of thermal pretreatment and hydrometallurgy, in which aqueous chemistry is used to recover the metals. Several companies are developing systems that will use this combination, but the researchers at Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, discovered that these companies use widely differing temperatures and times in their processes, and that there was a great need for a comparative study to determine the optimal thermal treatment and hydrometallurgical process for recycling lithium-ion batteries. 30 minutes and room temperature can suffice A key finding of the new study was that the hydrometallurgical process can be carried out at room temperature."</em> <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/chem/news/Pages/Perfecting-the-EV-battery-recycling-process.aspx">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This is my multiple-category project/productivity timer with RGB keys (real keyboard switches and keycaps!) and a colorful RGB backlit LCD. It’s a device I couldn’t buy for any price. I’ve tried software timers (and have made several) for desktop and phones. But when tasks start switching quickly (exactly when I want to track them the most), it’s always been too much of a hassle to operate a software timer. I really wanted to be able to hit a single key to switch timer categories."</em> <a href="http://ratfactor.com/multitimer">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/veebch/clock">Pico Railway Clock</a></h2>

<p><em>"Reinvigorating a handsome old clock and making it super-accurate, without any internet. Uses a Raspberry Pi Pico, a radio antenna and a couple of components to emulate a signal from a Mother clock. The DCF77 signal is a radio signal that carries information from some Atomic Clocks. The signal covers most of Europe and is accurate to within a second over about 300,000 years (the DCF77 signal has been broadcasting the time since 1973 and in 2021 it was agreed to be continued for at least 10 more years). (The United States uses WWVB, United Kingdom uses MSF and Japan uses JJY. You could easily adapt the code to any of those signals) Hardware - Old 'nebenuhr' clock with secondary mechanism (a mechanism that is controlled by pulses from the mother-clock) - A ferrite receiver (for the DCF77 signal) - A microcontroller (Raspberry Pi Pico) - Real time clock (RTC) (backup for any radio signal issues) - H bridge (LN298), for the polarity switch that triggers the clock mechanism - Step-up module to send correct voltage pulse to the clock (replaces the dc power supply used in the video)"</em> <a href="https://github.com/veebch/clock">[...]</a>

<p><em>"I recently took an ESP32-Cam module and built it into my mailbox. Got tired of walking outside to check it only to find it’s empty. It was a mostly straight forward process, however, I did run into a few snags so I thought I’d document it a little in case you are stuck in a similar project. The camera takes images of the inside of the mailbox a few times a day and uploads them to an FTP server. It is powered by a single 18650 lithium-ion cell that is kept charged by a small solar panel. I am not using the onboard regulator of the ESP module (AMS1117)."</em> <a href="https://fhuable.fhu-space.net/mailboxbot/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This robot walks along the trajectory that has been provided and acts as a building security guard from gas leaks. Introduction Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) as a Gas Decomposer using a Fan with Control P is a security robot that can detect gas. This robot will walk following the existing line trajectory. When it detects gas around the line, this robot will stop and turn on the fan to remove or decompose the gas that is around. When the gas is not detected, the robot will return to the path following the existing line. We use P control to control the fan speed based on the detected gas intensity, where the more gas detected, the faster the fan speed will spin."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/mhdkevinalghozali/mini-agv-as-a-gas-decomposer-using-fan-with-pid-control-f9e0a3">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This project can automatically classify three different musical genres (i.e., classical, metal, and reggae) from device-playing music files. Dataset Music can be classified into genres in a variety of ways, including rock, pop, religious, and secular music. This project uses a deep learning approach to automatically classify different musical genres. We'll need a set of audio tracks that are similar in size and frequency range. The GTZAN genre classification dataset is the most widely recommended dataset for music genre classification projects, and it was collected specifically for this purpose. In the years 2000-2001, the GTZAN genre collection dataset was compiled."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/tronixlabph/classify-music-genre-with-arduino-nano-33-ble-sense-fb2903">[...]</a>
