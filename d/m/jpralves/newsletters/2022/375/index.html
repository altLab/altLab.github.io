<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1673, o eminente relojoeiro inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Graham_(clockmaker)">George Graham</a>. Ele foi primeiro sócio, depois sucessor do negócio da Tompion. Graham melhorou a fuga do cilindro da Tompion's. Além disso, inventou (c. 1715) a fuga de cilindros (em que a roda de escape permanece estacionária quando não avança.) Usando estes dois desenvolvimentos em conjunto, os relógios de Graham's funcionaram com uma precisão insuperável durante mais de um século e meio. Também fez aparelhos astronómicos para Edmond Halley, James Bradley, a Academia Francesa de Ciências, e Charles Boyle, 4º Conde de Orrery. Para este último, concebeu um modelo de relógio mostrando os movimentos dos planetas à volta do Sol, posteriormente conhecido como um orrery. Inventou um calibrador de feixe com um parafuso micrómetro.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1752, o inventor e tecelão francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Marie_Jacquard">Joseph Marie Jacquard</a>. Ele inventou o tear de energia programável Jacquard para tecido de brocado. O seu tear produziria mecanicamente qualquer padrão, controlado por cartões de controlo perfurados (1805). Isto serviu de impulso para a revolução tecnológica da indústria têxtil e é a base do tear automático moderno. O conceito de utilizar cartões perfurados foi mais tarde aplicado por Hollerith para acompanhar os dados do censo de 1890 dos EUA. A ideia evoluiu ainda mais para a introdução de cartões perfurados por computador.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1816, o astrónomo suíço <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Wolf">Rudolf Wolf</a>. Ele descobriu o ciclo das manchas solares de 11 anos e foi o co-descobridor da sua ligação com a actividade geomagnética na Terra. Em 1849, concebeu um sistema agora conhecido como o número de manchas solares de Wolf. Este sistema ainda é utilizado para estudar a actividade solar através da contagem das manchas solares e dos grupos de manchas solares. Em matemática, Wolf escreveu sobre teoria e geometria do número primo, e mais tarde sobre probabilidade e estatística - um longo artigo discutiu a experiência da agulha de Buffon. Ele estimou π pelos métodos de Monte Carlo.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1944, o embriologista inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Wilmut">Ian Wilmut</a>. Ele supervisionou a equipa de cientistas que produziu um cordeiro chamado Dolly, o primeiro mamífero clonado a partir de uma célula de um adulto. O nascimento da Dolly no Instituto Roslin, Edimburgo, Escócia, a 5 de Julho de 1996, foi anunciado a 23 de Fevereiro de 1997. O trabalho-chave foi realizado pelo microbiologista Keith Campbell.</p>

<p>Em 1936, várias patentes americanas foram concedidas ao seu inventor, Henry F. Phillips (Nos. 2.046.343, 2.046.837, -38, -39, -40), para o parafuso e chave de fendas Phillips. Descrevem um sistema de fixação envolvendo um recesso cruciforme pouco profundo e uma chave de fendas a condizer com uma ponta afunilada que convenientemente se auto-centram na cabeça do parafuso. Phillips fundou a Phillips Screw Company para licenciar as suas patentes. Após três anos de rejeição, finalmente convenceu a Empresa Americana de Parafusos a gastar $500.000 para desenvolver um processo de produção e fabricar os parafusos. A General Motors foi convencida a utilizar os parafusos no seu Cadillac de 1936. Em 1940, praticamente todos os fabricantes de automóveis americanos tinham mudado para parafusos Phillips.</p>

<p><em>"A new study using archival observations by the now-retired Spitzer Space Telescope found a common trait among distant worlds where the exotic clouds form. Most clouds on Earth are made of water, but beyond our planet they come in many chemical varieties. The top of Jupiter’s atmosphere, for example, is blanketed in yellow-hued clouds made of ammonia and ammonium hydrosulfide. And on worlds outside our solar system, there are clouds composed of silicates, the family of rock-forming minerals that make up over 90% of Earth’s crust. But researchers haven’t been able to observe the conditions under which these clouds of small dust grains form. A new study appearing in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society provides some insight: The research reveals the temperature range at which silicate clouds can form and are visible at the top of a distant planet’s atmosphere."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasa-helps-decipher-how-some-distant-planets-have-clouds-of-sand">[...]</a>

<p><em>" Nexperia, the expert in essential semiconductors, today announced the release of a new range of 20 V &amp; 30 V MOSFETs in the world’s smallest DFN package, the DFN0603. Nexperia already offers ESD protection devices in this package, but has now succeeded in bringing it to their MOSFET portfolio, a feat as yet unmatched in the industry. Next generation wearable and hearable devices are incorporating new levels of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), creating several challenges for product designers. Firstly, available board space is at a premium as functionality is added, plus heat dissipation becomes a problem as power consumption increases. Nexperia has drawn on its decades of experience as an industry leader in the production of discrete components and designed this innovative range of tiny MOSFETs to successfully overcome both concerns. The ultra-low-profile DFN0603 package, measuring only 0.63 x 0.33 x 0.25 mm, uses 13% less space than MOSFETs in the next smallest package (DFN0604)."</em> <a href="https://www.nexperia.com/about/news-events/press-releases/Nexperia-releases-the-smallest-DFN-MOSFETs-in-the-world-.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ: NXPI) today announced that a specialized security algorithm co-authored by NXP security experts has been selected by NIST to become part of an industry global standard designed to counter quantum threats. A second algorithm co-authored by NXP will also advance to the fourth and final round for further analysis and consideration for standardization. As the dangers of quantum computers become more clear, this effort anticipates the need to protect encrypted data and connected devices. The selected post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms will be used to develop a new public key encryption standard that is secure against both traditional and quantum computers. Many cyber security experts believe that when large-scale quantum computers come to fruition, the sheer computing power of these machines will be able to “solve” encryption challenges in a fraction of the time, breaking today’s public key encryption systems and leaving data, digital signatures and devices vulnerable. This creates substantial security risks for online devices and data, including financial transactions, critical infrastructure, over-the-air update mechanisms, and more."</em> <a href="https://www.nxp.com/company/about-nxp/nxp-helps-standardize-next-generation-security-with-post-quantum-cryptography:NW-NXP-HELPS-STANDARDIZE-NEXT-GENERATION-SECURITY">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Our maXTouch KoD controller enables innovative Human-Machine Interface (HMI) solutions by combining mechanical knobs with existing multi-touch displays. Many automotive and industrial touch HMI designers are looking to merge the benefits of a mechanical rotary encoder input with the flexibility of modern multi-touch displays. Microchip Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP) today announces the maXTouch® Knob-on-Display™ (KoD™) family of touchscreen controllers as the first automotive-grade touchscreen controller family to natively support the detection and reporting of capacitive rotary encoders, as well as mechanical switches on top of a touch panel. Unlike traditional mechanical rotary encoders, this new technology enables the mounting of the knob directly onto the display without an opening in the panel or any customization of the touch pattern, increasing design flexibility and system cost savings. The KoD technology eliminates the need for custom touch sensor patterns, providing designers the ability to easily implement a different knob count, shape and position to accommodate a variety of end-user products. The customized configurations are adjustable without changing the embedded firmware of the maXTouch KoD touch controller, leading to a faster and more flexible development cycle."</em> <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/about/news-releases/products/maxtouch-knob-on-display-touch-controller-family">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Nearly 400 wind farms in Ireland today collectively generate more than 35% of the island’s electricity. These carbon-free electrons travel on power transmission lines to farms, businesses and homes, helping utilities avoid emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels to generate electricity. Like everywhere around the world, the intensity of the wind in Ireland fluctuates throughout the day and over the course of the seasons, which causes variable power production. As the supply of renewable energy increases, a growing problem for electric power grid operators is created. That’s because they need to only put on the exact amount of energy that users are pulling out.

<p><em>"The collaboration has observed a new kind of “pentaquark” and the first-ever pair of “tetraquarks” The international LHCb collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has observed three never-before-seen particles: a new kind of “pentaquark” and the first-ever pair of “tetraquarks”, which includes a new type of tetraquark. The findings, presented today at a CERN seminar, add three new exotic members to the growing list of new hadrons found at the LHC. They will help physicists better understand how quarks bind together into these composite particles. Quarks are elementary particles and come in six flavours: up, down, charm, strange, top and bottom. They usually combine together in groups of twos and threes to form hadrons such as the protons and neutrons that make up atomic nuclei. More rarely, however, they can also combine into four-quark and five-quark particles, or “tetraquarks” and “pentaquarks”."</em> <a href="https://home.cern/news/news/physics/lhcb-discovers-three-new-exotic-particles">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/IBM-TEL-chip-debonding">The breakthrough that could simplify the 3D chipmaking supply chain</a></h2>

<p><em>"IBM Research and Tokyo Electron have partnered on a chipmaking innovation that simplifies the supply chain and process for producing wafers with 3D chip stacking technology. The demand for computer chips has never been higher, but the last two years have put unprecedented pressure on global supply chains.

The 55-pound (25 kilograms) CAPSTONE successfully performed its first engine burn today (July 7), an 11-minute maneuver that started at 8:30 a.m. EDT (1230 GMT) and changed its velocity by 45 mph (72 kph) as planned, NASA officials said in an update(opens in new tab). CAPSTONE is now about 289,000 miles (465,000 kilometers) from Earth, agency officials added. That's significantly beyond the orbit of the moon, but that's part of the plan; the probe is taking a long, looping and highly fuel-efficient path that will deliver it to lunar orbit on Nov. 13.

<p><em>"A small asteroid the size of a bus will make an extremely close approach to Earth on Thursday (July 7), passing within just 56,000 miles (90,000 kilometers) – or about 23 percent of the average distance between Earth and the Moon. And just a few days ago, no one knew it was coming The asteroid, named 2022 NF, is expected to pass safely by our planet, according to calculations by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Astronomers discovered the sneaky asteroid using data from the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS) – a system of cameras and telescopes based in Hawaii with the primary goal of detecting near-Earth objects, or NEOs. On July 4, researchers identified the object and calculated its approximate size and trajectory, estimating that the space rock measured between 18 and 41 feet wide (5.5 meters and 12.5 meters) at its longest dimension. Because of its diminutive size, 2022 NF does not fit NASA's criteria for a "potentially hazardous asteroid," which generally must measure at least 460 feet (140 meters) long and pass within 4.6 million miles (7.5 million km) of Earth, according to Live Science's sister site Space.com. While the newly detected asteroid will sail well within that distance, it is much too small to be considered an existential threat to Earth."</em> <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/astronomers-just-detected-an-asteroid-that-s-passing-extremely-close-to-earth-today">[...]</a>

Using a novel fabrication process, MIT researchers have produced smart textiles that snugly conform to the body so they can sense the wearer’s posture and motions.

They used this process to create a “smart” shoe and mat, and then built a hardware and software system to measure and interpret data from the pressure sensors in real time. The machine-learning system predicted motions and yoga poses performed by an individual standing on the smart textile mat with about 99 percent accuracy.

The four selected encryption algorithms will become part of NIST’s post-quantum cryptographic standard, expected to be finalized in about two years. “Today’s announcement is an important milestone in securing our sensitive data against the possibility of future cyberattacks from quantum computers,” said Secretary of Commerce Gina M. Raimondo. “Thanks to NIST’s expertise and commitment to cutting-edge technology, we are able to take the necessary steps to secure electronic information so U.S. businesses can continue innovating while maintaining the trust and confidence of their customers.” The announcement follows a six-year effort managed by NIST, which in 2016 called upon the world’s cryptographers to devise and then vet encryption methods that could resist an attack from a future quantum computer that is more powerful than the comparatively limited machines available today. The selection constitutes the beginning of the finale of the agency’s post-quantum cryptography standardization project. “NIST constantly looks to the future to anticipate the needs of U.S. industry and society as a whole, and when they are built, quantum computers powerful enough to break present-day encryption will pose a serious threat to our information systems,” said Under Secretary of Commerce for Standards and Technology and NIST Director Laurie E.

In order for a soft material to be considered for use as an artificial muscle, it must be able to output mechanical energy and remain viable under high-strain conditions — meaning it does not easily lose its form and strength after repeated work cycles. While many materials have been considered contenders for making artificial muscles, dielectric elastomers (DE) — lightweight materials with high elastic energy density — have been of special interest because of their optimal flexibility and toughness.

Most solar generation systems used for residential areas have fixed solar panels, frequently mounted on the roof. Some solar generation sites have panels mounted in the fixed but optimal angle that can be used year-round. Some sites use adjustable tilt angle panels whose tilt angles are adjusted each season to improve efficiency. This project will have two solar panels – one is fixed (orientation and tilt) and the other tracks the sun and compare solar irradiance performance of the two systems. For tracking system, the solar panel’s tilt angle is adjusted by a servo motor, and the servo motor is mounted on the stepper for orientation adjustment."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/a-t-robotics/solar-irradiance-comparison-fixed-vs-tracking-fd594e">[...]</a>

<p><em>"OpenRefMic is an open hardware design for a reference microphone that fits in the popular 1/2" reference microphone form factor, works with consumer microphone interfaces, and meets or exceeds the performance of professional reference microphones at a vastly reduced total system cost. Critical specs, performance - Frequency Response: 10Hz-25kHz (±1dB after EQ) - Noise Floor: 18dBA - Acoustic Overload Point: 118dBSPL - Dimensions: 12.7x99mm - Parts cost: $40 (not including 3D printed parts) - Interface: mini-XLR, 48V phantom power - Total system cost: &lt;$250 (with Focusrite Scarlett 2i2) The core of the OpenRefMic design is a preamplifier that biases an electret microphone from 48V phantom power and buffers the microphone signal to send it to a standard microphone interface. The circuit was designed for the PUI AOM-5024L-HD-F-R low noise microphone capsule, and has been built and tested with that part, but should work with most other electret mics. The schematic and PCB layout were done with KiCAD and are available in the Preamplifier section of the project, along with the BOM for all electrical and mechanical parts. OpenRefMic construction is simple. The case is 3D printed with any standard material, and the mic capsule is held in place with a press-fit grille printed in TPU."</em> <a href="https://github.com/loudifier/OpenRefMic">[...]</a>
