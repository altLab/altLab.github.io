<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1877, o inventor norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Lionel_Cowen">Joshua Lionel Cowen</a>. Ele ficou conhecido pela invenção de comboios modelo eléctricos. Aos 18 anos, tinha inventado um rastilho para acender o pó de magnésio para fotografia com flash, que o Departamento da Marinha lhe comprou para ser um rastilho para detonar minas submarinas. Ele concebeu uma luz de tubo de bateria, mas sem aplicação prática. (O seu parceiro, Conrad Hubert, a quem deu os direitos melhorou-o e fundou a Eveready Flashlight Company). Aos 22 anos de idade, criou uma locomotiva de comboios movida a bateria, destinada apenas como atraidor de atenção para outras mercadorias na montra de uma loja. Para sua surpresa, muitos clientes queriam comprar o comboio de brinquedo. Assim, fundou uma empresa modelo de caminhos-de-ferro.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1910, o inventor norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Neustadter">Arnold Neustadter</a>. Ele inventou o Rolodex, um ficheiro de cartas rotativas por ordem alfabética com uma embraiagem com rolamentos de esferas. Ele inventou o dispositivo nos anos 40 com a ajuda de um engenheiro que desenvolveu a caixa cilíndrica. Neustadter especializou-se em tecnologia de escritório, inventando também o Swivodex, um tinteiro à prova de derramamento e o Clipodex, uma ferramenta de ditado de joelho.</p>

<p>Há trinta e três anos atrás, a 25 de Agosto de 1989, a nave espacial Voyager 2 da NASA fez um voo de aproximação a Neptuno. Deu à humanidade o seu primeiro grande plano do 8º planeta do nosso sistema solar. Também marcou o fim da Grande Viagem da missão Voyager aos 4 planetas gigantes do sistema solar, Júpiter, Saturno, Urano e Neptuno.</p>

<p>Há 31 anos era anunciado publicamente, por Linus Torvalds, o Linux. A sua intenção de criar o Linux como um sistema operativo livre, como um hobby, nada de profissional, e apenas para processadores intel 386/486. Passados estes anos todos sabemos a importância e impacto que este sistema tem no mundo actual e a forma humilde como nasceu. Sendo usado em todo os smartphones Android, routers, set-top-boxes, servidores, Desktops e nos 500 mais rápidos super-computadores, trata-se de um software bastante complexo e que está presente, ainda que escondido, nas nossas vidas.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker e alguns vídeos interessantes. É apresentada a revista MagPI Magazine nº121 de Setembro e o livro "Build a Raspberry Pi Media Player".</p>

<p><em>"Could one of the biggest puzzles in astrophysics be solved by reworking Albert Einstein’s theory of gravity? A new study co-authored by NASA scientists says not yet. The universe is expanding at an accelerating rate, and scientists don’t know why. This phenomenon seems to contradict everything researchers understand about gravity’s effect on the cosmos: It’s as if you threw an apple in the air and it continued upward, faster and faster. The cause of the acceleration, dubbed dark energy, remains a mystery. A new study from the international Dark Energy Survey, using the Victor M. Blanco 4-meter Telescope in Chile, marks the latest effort to determine whether this is all simply a misunderstanding: that expectations for how gravity works at the scale of the entire universe are flawed or incomplete."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasa-scientists-help-probe-dark-energy-by-testing-gravity">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-perseverance-makes-new-discoveries-in-mars-jezero-crater">NASA’s Perseverance Makes New Discoveries in Mars’ Jezero Crater</a></h2>

<p><em>"The rover found that Jezero Crater’s floor is made up of volcanic rocks that have interacted with water. Scientists got a surprise when NASA’s Perseverance Mars rover began examining rocks on the floor of Jezero Crater in spring of 2021: Because the crater held a lake billions of years ago, they had expected to find sedimentary rock, which would have formed when sand and mud settled in a once-watery environment. Instead, they discovered the floor was made of two types of igneous rock – one that formed deep underground from magma, the other from volcanic activity at the surface. The findings are described in four new papers published Thursday, Aug. 25. In Science, one offers an overview of Perseverance’s exploration of the crater floor before it arrived at Jezero’s ancient river delta in April 2022; a second study in the same journal details distinctive rocks that appear to have formed from a thick body of magma. The other two papers, published in Science Advances, detail the unique ways that Perseverance’s rock-vaporizing laser and ground-penetrating radar established that igneous rocks cover the crater floor."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-perseverance-makes-new-discoveries-in-mars-jezero-crater">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Two astrophotographers have teamed up to produce an out-of-this-world photo of the moon, capturing over 200,000 shots to create a single image. Andrew McCarthy and Connor Matherne collaborated last November to push their photography skills to the limit. Their finished product was posted online Saturday, and is currently gaining lots of attention on Reddit. The two stargazers first connected over Reddit and then Instagram, sharing and commenting on each other's work over the past three or four years. After recognizing one another's strengths in photography, they decided to team up for a photoshoot of Earth's moon. "When he and I put our heads together we were able to make something a little off brand for both of us, which is cool," McCarthy told NPR."</em> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/08/22/1118713393/astrophotographers-moon-reddit-image">[...]</a>

<p><em>"SpaceX launched another big batch of its Starlink internet satellites to orbit today (Aug. 19) and also aced a rocket landing at sea. A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying 53 Starlink spacecraft lifted off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida today at, appropriately enough, 3:21 p.m. EDT (1921 GMT). About nine minutes into the mission, the Falcon 9's first stage came back to Earth for a vertical touchdown on the SpaceX droneship A Shortfall of Gravitas, which was stationed in the Atlantic Ocean off the Florida coast. It was the ninth launch and landing for this particular Falcon 9 first stage, according to a SpaceX mission description(opens in new tab). The rocket's upper stage, meanwhile, continued its way upward, eventually deploying the 53 satellites into low Earth orbit as planned a little over 15 minutes after launch, SpaceX confirmed via Twitter(opens in new tab). SpaceX has already launched more than 3,000 spacecraft for its Starlink constellation, which beams broadband service to customers around the globe."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-starlink-group-4-27-launch-rocket-landing">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google is combining the eyes and arms of physical robots with the knowledge and conversation skills of virtual chatbots to help its employees fetch soda and chips from breakrooms with ease. The mechanical waiters, shown in action to reporters last week, embody an artificial intelligence breakthrough that paves the way for multipurpose robots as easy to control as ones that perform single, structured tasks such as vacuuming or standing guard. Google robots are not ready for sale. They perform only a few dozen simple actions, and the company has not yet embedded them with the "OK, Google" summoning feature familiar to consumers. While Google says it is pursuing development responsibly, adoption could ultimately stall over concerns such as robots becoming surveillance machines, or being equipped with chat technology that can give offensive responses, as Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) and others have experienced in recent years. Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) are pursuing comparable research on robots."</em> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/ok-google-get-me-coke-ai-giant-demos-soda-fetching-robots-2022-08-16/">[...]</a>

Research at the Vitoria-Gasteiz Faculty of Engineering of the UPV/EHU has used convolutional neural networks to predict airflow characteristics in the aerodynamic profiles of high-power wind turbines, and has shown that flow control devices can be studied using these neural networks, with tolerable errors and a reduction in computational time of four orders of magnitude. The study has been published by Scientific Reports - NATURE. Wind energy has become an important source of electricity generation and aims to achieve a cleaner, more sustainable energy model. However, in order to compete with conventional energy resources, the performance of wind turbines needs to be improved. To do this, flow control devices are deployed on the aerofoils to improve the aerodynamic efficiency of the wind turbine rotors: “So, with the same wind turbine you can produce more megawatts, the cost per megawatt hour is reduced, and when that is transferred, for example, to an offshore wind turbine (which is huge), means that the implementation cost is negligible, but the aerodynamic improvement may be in the region of 8 or 10 %,” explained Unai Fernández-Gámiz, lecturer in the Department of Nuclear Engineering and Fluid Mechanics of the UPV/EHU-University of the Basque Country."</em> <a href="https://www.ehu.eus/en/web/campusa-magazine/-/neural-networks-being-used-to-improve-the-performance-of-high-power-wind-turbines">[...]</a>

These experiments combine several key aspects of quantum many-​body physics in unexpected ways, thus paving a novel path to understanding and creating exotic states of quantum matter. Pumps, in a nutshell, are devices that use cyclic motion to attain the steady transport of some cargo. In a bicycle pump, the repeated up and down strokes of a piston create air flow. In an Archimedean screw pump (pictured below), water is transferred between reservoirs by turning a crank. Related concepts have been explored as well in quantum systems, in particular for transporting electrons one by one through solid-​state materials, thereby generating a quantised current."</em> <a href="https://www.phys.ethz.ch/news-and-events/d-phys-news/2022/08/a-quantum-pump-without-the-crank.html">[...]</a>

This new detector, known as sPHENIX – together with RHIC’s newly enhanced STAR detector – will greatly advance physicists’ ability to study subtle details of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) – a remarkable form of matter that filled the early Universe. RHIC recreates tiny specks of this early-Universe particle soup thousands of times each second by colliding the nuclei of atoms at nearly the speed of light. Over the next three years, sPHENIX and STAR will provide unprecedented views of the primordial plasma, in which the most fundamental building blocks of visible matter – quarks and gluons – flow like a nearly perfect liquid with virtually no resistance. Those studies will complete RHIC’s mission to unravel the mysteries of QGP, including how it evolved nearly 14 billion years ago into the protons and neutrons that make up the nuclei of atoms."</em> <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=220781">[...]</a>

Today, scientists will describe how flat wooden shapes extruded by a 3D printer can be programmed to self-morph into complex 3D shapes. In the future, this technique could be used to make furniture or other wooden products that could be shipped flat to a destination and then dried to form the desired final shape. The researchers will present their results at the fall meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS). ACS Fall 2022 is a hybrid meeting being held virtually and in-person Aug. 21–25, with on-demand access available Aug. 26–Sept."</em> <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/newsreleases/2022/august/your-next-wooden-chair-could-arrive-flat-then-dry-into-3d-shape-video.html">[...]</a>

A thermostat is the single most beneficial device that one can add to their home so it automatically maintains a steady and comfortable temperature in the home. There are many types and variants of this simple device but in a nutshell, a thermostat is just a temperature-operated switch that controls a heater or a cooler depending on the setup and application. In my example, I made a thermostat that can be attached to a central heating system, like a pellet burner, that can be then controlled via Bluetooth Low Energy from a mobile phone using a custom-built application. The entire project is based on the XIAO nRF52840 BLE board from Seeed Studio and uses a DHT22 sensor to measure the temperature and humidity of the room. Tools and materials used in the project: - XIAO BLE nRF52840 - 5V Single Channel Relay - Mini SPDT Switch - DHT22 Temperature &amp; Humidity Sensor - Mini breadboards - Mini breadboard jumpers - Breadboard jump wires - LiPo Battery - Soldering station - Cheap Android phone"</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/taste-the-code/arduino-ble-thermostat-with-mobile-app-f05a2a">[...]</a>

This is the simplest form of FM transmitter which has the capability of transferring broadcasted music or voice to a range of 50m depending on the type of antenna that has been used. The system works without the requirement of tuning and the crystal quarts used are locked to a maximum of 90MHz. This system can eliminate frequency drift which is a common effect of modern LC-based transmitter systems. The system is built around low power audio amplifier LM386, PN2222Atransistor, 1SV149 varactor diode, 30MHz crystal quartz, and several other components like potentiometer, diodes, capacitors, and resistors. The tank circuit built at the collector of PN2222A which is made up of inductor L1 and capacitor C5 has a tuning of 3 times what the crystal quartz is rated which is 90MHz."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/simon-mugo/fm-transmitter-system-board-7a7fbf">[...]</a>

RAM is indeed the most limiting factor on many boards as it dictates how much data you can hold in memory at any given time. Until recently, most microcontrollers had RAM memory ranging from 2 Kb (Arduino UNO) to 8 Kb (Arduino MEGA). Many other microcontrollers were in the same ballpark. Nowadays we experienced a huge leap forward and boards come equipped with up to 512 Kb of RAM.

A PID controller continuously calculates an error value as the difference between a desired setpoint and a measured process variable and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms. In our case, the MPU6050 sensor collects data of the position (more precisely the angle) of the device, and sends that data to the microcontroller which performs calculations based on previously given algorithms and constants, and sends the result to the electric motor, which with its movement tends to hold the device in the desired position.

As I understand it a hobbyist back in the day could get an ASCII keyboard that quite literally presented as an interface a header giving 7-bits of ASCII and an additional strobe pin that indicated that a key had been pressed. Press the “A” key on the keyboard and the 7-bits representing the letter “A” in ASCII would be set high/low on 7 output pins and the strobe pin would momentarily go high. Needless to say, the Apple I was wired up in such a way that when the strobe pin pulsed it would immediately fetch the 7-bits of ASCII from the keyboard. And just as simply, to display a character the Apple I would output ASCII in the same manner. In the output case, another device similar to the TV Typewriter would look for a similar “strobe” and push the character into a buffer that was constantly being read from and displayed to a television display."</em> <a href="https://www.engineersneedart.com/adam74/adam74.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Virtualise a non-linear sensor into a single linear function using the LInterp PROGMEM array generator This tutorial shows you how to "Virtualise" a non-linear magnetic position sensor to produce an accurate linear position measurement from a single function call. It uses the LInterp array generator described in the ProjectHub tutorial "LInterp - A linear interpolation PROGMEM array generator" to produce a linear translation array for the sensor in program-space memory (PROGMEM). The resulting sensor measurement function uses no RAM storage. This scheme works on any Arduino board. A simple magnetic position sensor A Hall-effect magnetic flux sensor such as the Allegro Microsystems UGN3503 used in this tutorial makes an excellent contact-free short-range position sensor when used with a small rare-earth magnet positioned on the moving part being monitored. It is ideal where a position sensor must be fitted to existing equipment non-invasively (apart from a static magnetic field) or where a mechanical sensor would offer too much motive resistance."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/dxb_/a-precise-linear-magnetic-position-sensor-using-linterp-1a80df">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The USB Power Injector allows a convenient way to power up USB 2.0 devices from a lab power supply, while still allowing data transfer. When powering devices from a standard USB 2.0 port, either from a PC or from a standard USB hub, you never have the niceties that an adjustable lab style power supply has. During development that means you can’t set precise voltage and current limits. In the best case scenario, that means you can’t test under/over voltage protections. In the worst case, you run excessive current trough your device and you don’t even know that’s happened.USB hubs tend to have overcurrent protection, but most don’t send the overcurrent event to the operating system.That can cause confusion and loss of time for a hardware engineer during development or to testing personnel during production.This project allows a way to conveniently power a USB2.0 device from a lab power supply and thus avoiding the problems described above. The schematic for this project is quite simple."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/nikola-manolov/usb-power-injector-547960">[...]</a>

<p><em>"3.7" E paper shows time synchronized at powerup in the style of an analog clock as well as of the corresponding group of words. The display which is connected to the ESP32 via SPI Interface, is driven with the GxEPD2 library and the fonts are provided by the U8g2_for_Adafruit_GFX library whose methods work inside the picture loop (paged drawing) of GxEPD2. The time information is received from a public ntp (network time protocol) server in the setup and then copied to the time structure (struct tm) named timeinfo in updateTime(). Admittedly I have zero knowlegde in programming and thus the synchronization of the time could be programmed much more effectively and smart. I used the strftime function to generate three strings for hour, minute and second and then converted them back to integers. Once at start the number of seconds at this moment is then subtracted from the minute the clock normally waits until it updates the time to the next minute and refreshes the display."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/trialrunner/simple-fine-drawn-analog-and-word-clock-on-e-paper-b94eba">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Last month I spent quite a lot of time on expansion modules for use with the ESP-12E I2C Base Card. While the system worked exceptionally well as a prototyping and firmware testing platform ( as originally intended ), I immediately saw that the physical size of everything ( base board, with the cards) would be a problem inside any enclosure, when used with a real-world project. At the same time, I have an ongoing need to design and manufacture a device for a friend, that will have very limited space inside the enclosure due to other essential components. I have thus decided to combine the functionality of two of the IO Expander cards into a more compact design, on a single PCB ( Which I plan to use to power and control an Air Assist blower on my desktop CNC/Laser cutter, as well as function as a next step prototype for my other project.
