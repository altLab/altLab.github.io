<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1616, o anatomista e matemático dinamarquês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bartholin">Thomas Bartholin</a>. Ele foi o primeiro a descrever completamente todo o sistema linfático humano (1652) e um dos primeiros defensores da descoberta de Harvey da circulação do sangue. Entrou para a faculdade de matemática (1647-49), depois foi professor de anatomia (1649-61) na Universidade de Copenhaga. Publicou muitos trabalhos sobre anatomia, fisiologia e medicina, (1645-74) e um trabalho geral sobre farmacologia (1658). Em 1654, Bartholin e a faculdade de medicina da sua universidade publicaram conselhos sobre como as pessoas podiam cuidar de si próprias durante a peste. Depois de uma propriedade comprada por Bartholin (1663) ter sido destruída pelo fogo em 1670, o rei Christian V pagou-lhe um salário anual como seu médico pessoal, embora os seus serviços fossem raramente necessários.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1891, o físico inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Chadwick">James Chadwick</a>. Ele recebeu o Prémio Nobel da Física (1935) pela sua descoberta do neutrão. Estudou em Cambridge, e em Berlim sob a orientação de Geiger, tendo depois trabalhado no Laboratório Cavendish com Rutherford, onde investigou a estrutura do átomo. Trabalhou na dispersão de partículas alfa e na desintegração nuclear. Ao bombardear berílio com partículas alfa, Chadwick descobriu o neutrão - uma partícula neutra no núcleo do átomo - pelo qual recebeu o Prémio Nobel da Física em 1935. Em 1932, Chadwick cunhou o nome "neutrão", que descreveu num artigo da revista Nature. Liderou o trabalho do Reino Unido sobre a bomba atómica na II Guerra Mundial, e foi nomeado cavaleiro em 1945.</p>

<p>Em 1906, o Dr. Lee DeForest (26 Aug 1873 - 30 Jun 1961), um dos "pais da rádio", anunciou o seu tubo de vácuo eléctrico de três elementos (agora conhecido como triodo) numa reunião do Instituto Americano de Engenheiros Electrotécnicos. Ele tinha descoberto que quando uma malha, ou grelha, de arame era colocada entre o filamento e a "placa" colectora num tubo de díodo (feito pela primeira vez por J. Ambrose Fleming, 1904), um grande efeito amplificador de tensão podia ser produzido. A DeForest patenteou este tubo de vácuo em 15 de Janeiro de 1907. A capacidade deste tubo para amplificar sinais fracos era uma invenção tão grande como o próprio rádio, porque tornava possível a comunicação de longa distância.</p>

<p>Em 1983, a quinta definição legal do metro foi a distância que a luz percorre no vácuo em 1/299.792.458 de um segundo. comprimento do metro foi redefinido na 17ª reunião do organismo internacional Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures (GCPM) por um método para dar maior precisão. Superou a quarta definição legal adoptada em 14 de Outubro de 1960 com base numa linha espectral de kryton. As definições anteriores incluíam a distância entre as marcas no protótipo internacional de barra métrica feita de liga de platina e irídio (28 de Setembro de 1889). Antes disso, foi decidido que o metro deveria ser um décimo-milionésimo da distância do Pólo Norte ao equador (1 de Agosto de 1793), e o conceito mais antigo era o comprimento de um pêndulo com meio período de um segundo (8 de Maio de 1790).</p>

<p>E nesta semana que passou a canonical lançou o Ubuntu 22.10. Com o nome de código "Kinetic Kudu", esta versão inclui as mais recentes toolchains de ferramentas e aplicações com particular incidência no ecossistema da Internet das Coisas. Esta nova versão desta distribuição trás o Kernel 5.19 do Linux acompanhado pelo GNOME 43. Adicionalmente trás atualizações nos subsistemas Mesa, Pipewire, BlueZ e CUPS para além das ultimas versões do Firefox, do LibreOfficee e do Thunderbird.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker e alguns vídeos interessantes. É apresentada a revistar HackSpace Magazine nº 60 de Novembro.</p>

<p><em>"The rover has arrived at a special region believed to have formed as Mars’ climate was drying. After journeying this summer through a narrow, sand-lined pass, NASA’s Curiosity Mars rover recently arrived in the “sulfate-bearing unit,” a long-sought region of Mount Sharp enriched with salty minerals. Scientists hypothesize that billions of years ago, streams, and ponds left behind the minerals as the water dried up. Assuming the hypothesis is correct, these minerals offer tantalizing clues as to how – and why – the Red Planet’s climate changed from being more Earth-like to the frozen desert it is today. The minerals were spotted by NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter years before Curiosity landed in 2012, so scientists have been waiting a long time to see this terrain up close. Soon after arriving, the rover discovered a diverse array of rock types and signs of past water, among them popcorn-textured nodules and salty minerals such as magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt is one kind), calcium sulfate (including gypsum), and sodium chloride (ordinary table salt)."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-curiosity-mars-rover-reaches-long-awaited-salty-region">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4490.html">Small and flexible synchronous buck controller from STMicroelectronics handles extreme step-down ratios</a></h2>

<p><em>"With compact dimensions and an input-voltage range from 6V to 75V, STMicroelectronics’ L3751 synchronous buck controller serves different applications from industrial equipment to battery powered light electric vehicles. The 3.5mm x 4.5mm controller is also suited to use in telecom and networking equipment that feature commonly used 24V and 48V buses. Having minimum on-time duration of 40ns, the L3751 can support an extremely low duty cycle thereby permitting a large step-down ratio. This allows powering low-voltage devices directly without intermediate conversion, which helps simplify circuit design and lower bill-of-materials (BOM) costs. The device integrates a 7.5V supply for the gate drivers. In addition to having a wide supply-voltage range, the L3751 has 100V-tolerant inputs that allow operation in harsh electrical environments."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4490.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Pictures of the sky can show us cosmic wonders; movies can bring them to life. Movies from NASA’s NEOWISE space telescope are revealing motion and change across the sky. Every six months, NASA’s Near-Earth Object Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer, or NEOWISE, spacecraft completes one trip halfway around the Sun, taking images in all directions. Stitched together, those images form an “all-sky” map showing the location and brightness of hundreds of millions of objects. Using 18 all-sky maps produced by the spacecraft (with the 19th and 20th to be released in March 2023), scientists have created what is essentially a time-lapse movie of the sky, revealing changes that span a decade. Each map is a tremendous resource for astronomers, but when viewed in sequence as a time-lapse, they serve as an even stronger resource for trying to better understand the universe."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasa-telescope-takes-12-year-time-lapse-movie-of-entire-sky">[...]</a>

NASA has successfully touched down on Mars nine times, relying on cutting-edge parachutes, massive airbags, and jetpacks to set spacecraft safely on the surface. Now engineers are testing whether or not the easiest way to get to the Martian surface is to crash. Rather than slow a spacecraft’s high-speed descent, an experimental lander design called SHIELD (Simplified High Impact Energy Landing Device) would use an accordion-like, collapsible base that acts like the crumple zone of a car and absorbs the energy of a hard impact.

<p><em>"Latest DisplayPort specification provides greater alignment with USB Type-C and USB4; adds new features for more efficient DisplayPort tunneling over USB4. The Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA®) announced today that it has released DisplayPort 2.1, the latest version of the DisplayPort specification, which is backward compatible with and supersedes the previous version of DisplayPort (DisplayPort 2.0). VESA has been working closely with member companies to ensure that products supporting DisplayPort 2.0 would actually meet the newer, more demanding DisplayPort 2.1 spec. Due to this effort, all previously certified DisplayPort 2.0 products including UHBR (Ultra-high Bit Rate) capable products – whether GPUs, docking station chips, monitor scalar chips, PHY repeater chips such as re-timers, or DP40/DP80 cables (including both passive and active, and using full-size DisplayPort, Mini DisplayPort or USB Type-C connectors) – have already been certified to the stricter DisplayPort 2.1 spec. Achieving a robust, end-to-end user visual experience remains the utmost priority for VESA's DisplayPort specification, whether across a native DisplayPort cable, via DisplayPort Alt Mode (DisplayPort over the USB Type-C connector), or tunneled through the USB4 link. As such, DisplayPort 2.1 has tightened its alignment with the USB Type-C specification as well as the USB4 PHY specification to facilitate a common PHY servicing both DisplayPort and USB4."</em> <a href="https://vesa.org/featured-articles/vesa-releases-displayport-2-1-specification/">[...]</a>

The solicitation does not include operational support for current infrastructure at the site that is still in use, including a 12-meter radio telescope or the Lidar facility, which is used to study the upper atmosphere and ionosphere to analyze cloud cover and precipitation data. The decision was mourned by scientists around the world who used the telescope at the Arecibo Observatory for years to search for asteroids, planets and extraterrestrial life. The 1,000-foot-wide (305-meter-wide) dish also was featured in the Jodie Foster film “Contact” and the James Bond movie “GoldenEye.” The reflector dish and the 900-ton platform hanging 450 feet above it previously allowed scientists to track asteroids headed to Earth, conduct research that led to a Nobel Prize and determine if a planet is potentially habitable."</em> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/astronomy-technology-science-caribbean-puerto-rico-f4dff01350154a2eb5460e5834564fbd">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Femtosecond lasers used to fabricate precision ultrathin mirrors for space telescopes that capture star formation and other high-energy space events Researchers have developed a new way to use femtosecond laser pulses to fabricate the high-precision ultrathin mirrors required for high-performance x-ray telescopes. The technique could help improve the space-based x-ray telescopes used to capture high-energy cosmic events involved in forming new stars and supermassive black holes. “Detecting cosmic x-rays is a crucial piece of our exploration of the universe that unveils the high-energy events that permeate our universe but are not observable in other wavebands,” said research team leader Heng Zuo, who performed the research at MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research and is now at the University of New Mexico. “The technologies our group developed will help telescopes obtain sharp images of astronomical x-rays that can answer many intriguing science questions.” X-ray telescopes orbit above the Earth’s atmosphere and contain thousands of thin mirrors that must each have a precisely curved shape and be carefully aligned with respect to all the other mirrors. In Optica, Optica Publishing Group’s journal for high-impact research, the researchers describe how they used femtosecond laser micromachining to bend these ultrathin mirrors into a precise shape and correct errors that can arise in the fabrication process. “It is difficult to make ultra-thin mirrors with an exact shape because the fabrication process tends to severely bend the thin material,” said Zuo."</em> <a href="https://www.optica.org/en-us/about/newsroom/news_releases/2022/october/new_way_to_make_telescope_mirrors_could_sharpen_ou/">[...]</a>

Recently, a research team co-led by chemists from City University of Hong Kong (CityU) discovered an innovative way to overcome this problem by introducing an unconventional phase nanomaterial as a catalyst, boosting battery energy efficiency up to 83.8%. The study reveals a novel design of catalysts for the new generation of meta-gas batteries that can contribute to carbon neutral goals. The metal-carbon dioxide battery can provide durable electricity (high energy density) for electronics, and enable carbon dioxide (CO2) fixation without extra energy consumption from an external circuit to convert CO2 greenhouse gas emissions into value-added products (Figure 1). In particular, the lithium-carbon dioxide battery has high theoretical energy density (1876 Wh kg-1), making it a promising candidate for next-generation high-performance energy conversion and storage technology.

<p><em>"Researchers create a method for magnetically programming materials to make cubes that are very picky about what they connect with, enabling more-scalable self-assembly. While automated manufacturing is ubiquitous today, it was once a nascent field birthed by inventors such as Oliver Evans, who is credited with creating the first fully automated industrial process, in flour mill he built and gradually automated in the late 1700s. The processes for creating automated structures or machines are still very top-down, requiring humans, factories, or robots to do the assembling and making. However, the way nature does assembly is ubiquitously bottom-up; animals and plants are self-assembled at a cellular level, relying on proteins to self-fold into target geometries that encode all the different functions that keep us ticking. For a more bio-inspired, bottom-up approach to assembly, then, human-architected materials need to do better on their own. Making them scalable, selective, and reprogrammable in a way that could mimic nature’s versatility means some teething problems, though."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/reprogrammable-materials-selectively-self-assemble-1020">[...]</a>

Advanced materials known as ferroelectrics present a promising solution to help lower the power consumed by the ultrasmall electronic devices found in cell phones and computers. Ferroelectrics — the electrical analog to ferromagnets — are a class of materials in which some of the atoms are arranged off-center, leading to a spontaneous internal electric charge or polarization.

<p><em>"Meet Sonny the UV Budgie - an automata IoT bird who looks up online weather data from the Met Office API and announces the UV index for the day and the week ahead (in doing so, he flaps his wings automaton-style!). The image of the display shows actual data in the UK heatwave where burn times were 20mins max. The Budgie warns the user of what the midday sun or 'Peak UV' will be (i.e. what's the most protection you need if leaving the house in the morning - when the UV might initially be low, but could get seriously high at noon! ), and serves as a reminder that, for example, sun protection is still relevant on a cloudy day. The UV Budgie was developed as a way to engage kids in becoming more aware of the importance of being ‘sun-safe’ by 'listening to Sonny's advice'."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Build-a-UV-Level-Monitoring-Budgie-Using-IoT-and-W/">[...]</a>

We will also go over some of the basic concpt In this tutorial let’s know aboutRaspberry Pi Pico ADC, How it works, what are its uses, Pinout, and finally how to read the ADC value of it with a MicroPython example code. In this tutorial, we will use the Pico board to perform an ADC conversion. The Raspberry Pi Pico has four 12-bit ADC channels, but one of them is connected to the internal temperature sensor. The remaining ADC is found at GPIO26, GPIO27, and GPIO28 as ADC0, ADC1, and ADC2, respectively.

<p><em>"This mobile robot with a 4 DOF robotic arm and camera can be controlled remotely from a host PC without the need to be in line of sight. Mobile Arm Robots combine the advantages of mobile platforms and robotic manipulator arms. The extra degrees of freedom from the mobile platform provide user with more workspace and accessibility. Such robots find their place in industrial, health-care and home-care sectors. This project shows how to build a basic WiFi remote controlled 4 wheeled mobile robot with a 4 axes robotic arm manipulator mounted on its chassis. It has an on-board WiFi camera mounted on the robotic arm."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/aadhuniklabs/arduino-based-wifi-mobile-robotic-arm-with-on-board-camera-339af6">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Get rid of the breadboard while using your ESP-32S, and also reuse this for a small project that doesn't need a custom PCB The ESP32-S is, at least in my opinion, one of the most versatile microcontrollers available to the Maker at this moment. It ticks almost all of my boxes for features required in a microcontroller, with a lot of gpio’s, WiFi, and Bluetooth, as well as a lot of storage space for code. I do however have an issue with it, which I usually get around by designing a custom circuit board with a specific purpose. This is great for a project, but as most projects do not start on a custom-built circuit board, I am usually required to use a breadboard module. This is where my problems start. These modules are cumbersome to fit on a breadboard, to say the least, taking up a lot of space, and leaving very little space to connect to its pins with anything else."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/MakerIoT2020/esp32-s-development-board-ee182f">[...]</a>
