<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1836, o químico norueguês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cato_Maximilian_Guldberg">Cato Maximilian Guldberg</a>. Ele, com o seu cunhado Peter Waage, formulou a lei da acção de massa (1864), que detalha os efeitos da concentração, massa, e temperatura nas taxas de reacção química. A lei estabelece que a taxa de uma alteração química depende das concentrações dos reagentes. Assim, para uma reacção: A + B -> C, a taxa de reacção é proporcional a [A][B], onde [A] e [B] são concentrações. Em 1870 Guldberg investigou a forma como o ponto de congelação e a pressão de vapor de um líquido puro são reduzidos por um componente dissolvido. Em 1890, formulou a lei de Guldberg que relaciona o ponto de ebulição e a temperatura crítica.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1921, o engenheiro electrotécnico britânico <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Kilburn">Tom Kilburn</a>. Ele escreveu o programa informático utilizado para testar o primeiro programa armazenado num computador, a Máquina Experimental de Pequena Escala, SSEM, também conhecida como "The Baby". Testado pela primeira vez em 21 de Junho de 1948, o programa demorou 52 minutos a ser executado. O pequeno computador experimental não tinha teclado nem impressora, mas testou com sucesso um sistema de memória desenvolvido na Universidade de Manchester, em Inglaterra. Este sistema, baseado num tubo de raios catódicos, foi o primeiro a poder armazenar programas, enquanto que os computadores electrónicos anteriores tinham de ser ligados novamente para executar cada novo problema.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1926, o bioquímico britânico <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Klug">Aaron Klug</a>. Ele recebeu o Prémio Nobel da Química de 1982 "pelo seu desenvolvimento da microscopia electrónica cristalográfica e pela sua elucidação estrutural de complexos biologicamente importantes de proteínas-ácido nucleico". Enquanto os padrões de difracção de raios X revelam quaisquer estruturas cristalinas tridimensionais altamente ordenadas, a técnica falha para as amostras biológicas com estruturas moleculares menos ordenadas. Contudo Klug desenvolveu a microscopia electrónica cristalográfica que combinava certos princípios dos métodos de difracção com a miscroscopia electrónica, de modo a poder descobrir a estrutura 3-D dos vírus ou amostras de combinações complicadas de ácidos nucleicos e proteínas, tal como se encontram nas membranas, fibras musculares e cromossomas.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1950, o engenheiro electrotécnico norte-americano, programador informático <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak">Steve Wozniak</a>. Também conhecido pelo seu apelido "Woz", ele em 1976, com o parceiro comercial Steve Jobs, foi co-fundador da Apple Inc., que mais tarde se tornou a maior empresa tecnológica do mundo por receitas e a maior empresa do mundo por capitalização de mercado. Através do seu trabalho na Apple nas décadas de 1970 e 1980, é amplamente reconhecido como um dos pioneiros proeminentes da revolução da computação pessoal. Em 1975, Wozniak começou a desenvolver o Apple I no computador que lançou a Apple quando ele e Jobs começaram a comercializá-lo pela primeira vez no ano seguinte. Concebeu principalmente o Apple II, introduzido em 1977, conhecido como um dos primeiros microcomputadores produzidos em massa de grande sucesso. Com o engenheiro de software Jef Raskin, Wozniak teve uma grande influência no desenvolvimento inicial dos conceitos originais Apple Macintosh de 1979 a 1981, quando Jobs assumiu o projecto após a breve saída de Wozniak da empresa devido a um acidente aéreo traumático.[6][7] Após deixar permanentemente a Apple em 1985, Wozniak fundou o CL 9 e criou o primeiro comando universal programável, lançado em 1987. Em seguida, prosseguiu vários outros negócios e empreendimentos filantrópicos ao longo da sua carreira, concentrando-se em grande parte na tecnologia nas escolas K-12.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1956, o matemático francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Louis_Lions">Pierre-Louis Lions</a>. Ele recebeu a Medalha Fields em 1994 pelo seu trabalho desde a década de 1980 sobre equações diferenciais parciais. As fontes de tais equações são muitas - por exemplo, físicas, probalísticas ou geométricas e outras sub-áreas diversas - cada uma estudando diferentes fenómenos para diferentes equações diferenciais parciais não lineares através de métodos totalmente diferentes. Pierre-Louis Lions tem sido chamado único na sua capacidade de transcender estas fronteiras e de resolver problemas prementes em todo o campo.</p>

<p><em>"Latham, New York – Hydrogen fuel cells packed into a pair of 40-foot-long shipping containers here ramped up on an overcast day early this June as engineers gathered around laptops displaying data on the state, health and power output of the cells in this first-of-a-kind hydrogen generator. “This is it, it’s running at three megawatts right now,” exclaimed Mark Monroe, a principal infrastructure engineer on Microsoft’s team for datacenter advanced development. A round of applause and shouts of joy from engineers at Plug, who built the fuel cell system, pierced the white noise from fans atop the shipping containers and pipes venting steam. The moment was the latest milestone on Microsoft’s quest to find a zero-carbon emissions replacement for the backup diesel-powered generators that support continuous operations in the event of power outages and other service disruptions. “What we just witnessed was, for the datacenter industry, a moon landing moment,” said Sean James, Microsoft’s director of datacenter research. “We have a generator that produces no emissions."</em> <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/innovation-stories/hydrogen-fuel-cells-could-provide-emission-free-backup-power-at-datacenters-microsoft-says/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The Microfluidics Cluster of the UPV/EHU-University of the Basque Country has developed a novel magnetic structure designed to manipulate small volumes of fluids. A multidisciplinary study conducted by the Microfluidics Cluster of the UPV/EHU has observed and characterised a novel system involving the use of an external magnetic field to manipulate the air-water interface. The study is part of the European multidisciplinary MAMI project, in which groups and companies from six countries are participating. The work has been featured on the front cover of the prestigious journal Langmuir. Inspired by natural materials that repel water, such as lotus leaves, the study and development of interesting hydrophobic surfaces has been arousing great interest in fields such as the precise manipulation of small volumes of fluids. When magnetic properties are integrated into hydrophobic materials, the remote manipulation of the material is boosted while water is repelled, thus providing fresh perspectives for possible applications."</em> <a href="https://www.ehu.eus/en/web/campusa-magazine/-/remotely-control-the-air-water-interface">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://discover.lanl.gov/news/0810-color-perception">Math error: A new study overturns 100-year-old understanding of color perception</a></h2>

<p><em>"A paradigm shift away from the 3D mathematical description developed by Schrödinger and others to describe how we see color could yield more vibrant computer displays, TVs, printed materials, textiles and more A new study corrects an important error in the 3D mathematical space developed by the Nobel Prize–winning physicist Erwin Schrödinger and others and used by scientists and industry for more than 100 years to describe how your eye distinguishes one color from another. The research has the potential to boost scientific data visualizations, improve TVs and recalibrate the textile and paint industries. “The assumed shape of color space requires a paradigm shift,” said Roxana Bujack, a computer scientist with a background in mathematics who creates scientific visualizations at Los Alamos National Laboratory.

<p><em>"Fabricating intricate optical structures onto the tip of an optical fiber creates a new source of special light beams. An all fiber-based approach to generating special optical beams, called Bessel beams, could open up new applications in imaging, optical trapping and communications. Bessel beams look quite different from the usual Gaussian light beams found in optics. In particular, they possess several interesting properties including self-healing, diffraction-free propagation and the ability to carry orbital angular momentum (OAM). This family of beams — also known as vortex beams with a characteristic ring-like shape and a dark central region — include different “orders” of beams carrying different values of OAM. However, the creation of Bessel beams is somewhat inconvenient: several bulk optical elements, such as spatial light modulators or cone-shaped axicons, are needed to convert Gaussian beams to Bessel beams."</em> <a href="https://discovery.kaust.edu.sa/en/article/1253/customized-fiber-generates-bessel-beams">[...]</a>

Growing up on a farm in Texas, there was always something for siblings Gia Schneider ’99 and Abe Schneider ’02, SM ’03 to do. But every Saturday at 2 p.m., no matter what, the family would go down to a local creek to fish, build rock dams and rope swings, and enjoy nature. Eventually the family began going to a remote river in Colorado each summer. The river forked in two; one side was managed by ranchers who destroyed natural features like beaver dams, while the other side remained untouched. The family noticed the fishing was better on the preserved side, which led Abe to try measuring the health of the two river ecosystems."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/natel-energy-hydropower-0805">[...]</a>

The team from RMIT University says the new greener and lighter concrete also promises to reduce manufacturing and transportation costs significantly. Small amounts of rubber particles from tyres are already used to replace these concrete aggregates, but efforts to replace all of the aggregates with rubber have produced weak concretes that failed to meet the required standards – until now. The study published in the Resources, Conservation &amp; Recycling journal reveals a manufacturing process for structural lightweight concrete where the traditional coarse aggregates in the mix were completely replaced by rubber from used car tyres. Lead author and PhD researcher from RMIT University’s School of Engineering, Mohammad Momeen Ul Islam, said the findings debunked a popular theory on what could be achieved with recycled rubber particles in concrete. “We have demonstrated with our precise casting method that this decades-old perceived limitation on using large amounts of coarse rubber particles in concrete can now be overcome,” Islam said."</em> <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/news/all-news/2022/august/rubber-concrete">[...]</a>

To establish that symbiosis, some legume plants produce hundreds of peptides that help bacteria live within structures known as nodules within their roots. A new study from MIT reveals that one of these peptides has an unexpected function: It sops up all available heme, an iron-containing molecule.

<p><em>"Researchers at Kanazawa University report in ACS Nano the development of a nanoparticle that acts as a heater and a thermometer. Inserting the nanoparticle in living cells results in a heat spot that, by switching it on and off, enables the controlled modulation of local cellular activities. Being able to heat nano-sized regions in biological tissues is key to several biomedical applications. Indeed, many biological processes are temperature-sensitive, and the ability to locally modify temperature provides a way to manipulate cellular activity. A notable purpose is the destruction of cancer cells by heating them. Beside the need for an in-tissue local heating mechanism, it also important to be able to instantaneously measure the generated temperature."</em> <a href="https://www.kanazawa-u.ac.jp/latest-research/109293">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A miniaturized robot invented by Nebraska’s Shane Farritor is on schedule to blast off into space to showcase its skills. NASA recently awarded the University of Nebraska-Lincoln $100,000 through the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) to ready the surgical robot for a 2024 test mission aboard the International Space Station. “NASA has been a long-term supporter of this research and, as a culmination of that effort, our robot will have a chance to fly on the International Space Station,” said Farritor, professor of engineering. Farritor is co-founder of Virtual Incision, a startup company based on Nebraska Innovation Campus. For nearly 20 years, he and his colleagues have been developing the tiny surgical robot known as MIRA, short for “miniaturized in vivo robotic assistant.” The company has attracted more than $100 million in venture capital investment since its founding in 2006. During the next year, Farritor and engineering graduate student Rachael Wagner will write software, configure MIRA to fit inside a space station experiment locker and exhaustively test the device to make sure it’s robust enough to survive launch and its systems will perform as anticipated in space."</em> <a href="https://news.unl.edu/newsrooms/today/article/husker-developed-surgical-robot-readies-for-space-station-test/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This is a memorandum about HAGIWO/ハギヲ using seeed Xiao rp2040 and rasberry PI rp2040 to make your own VCO for the modular combiner. 53rd self-made modular synth.I took a poll on my Youtube channel and the Rasberry pi pico VCO was the most popular. However, the Rasberry pi pico has only 3-pin AD converter, and I was worried that it was a little inconvenient to use it as a VCO. Under such circumstances, Seeed studio released a small microcomputer board called Seeed Xiao RP2040. Since the AD converter has 4 pins, I thought that I could make a VCO with a minimum configuration, so I planned this module. product specs Eurorack standard 3U 6HP sizepower supply: 45mA (at 5V) Canoperate with a single 5V power supply."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/hagiwo/diy-eurorack-modular-synth-rasberry-pi-vco-with-seeed-xiao-133ac0">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Build your own Li-Po &amp; Li-ion Balance Charger for under $10 Recently I purchased some 3S Li-Po batteries for a project I was working on. Unlike single cell batteries, batteries with multiple cells should be charged in a balanced way. This is to ensure that any single cell is not overcharged and hence possibly damaged. Note that the battery has a two connecters. The 2 pin connecter is the output of all three internal Li-Po cells in series. The 4 pin connector is the charging plug and corresponds to the B-, B1, B2 and B+ connections as shown in the diagram below."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/john-bradnam/3s-battery-charger-edee84">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Poseidon - is a modular control setup for your garden pond for sensors and switches. Monitoring is done with the TICK stack (Telegraf, Influxdb, Chronograf and Kapacitor) accompanied by a python Flask webserver for the control and quick overview. All is (in my setup) running on a raspberry PI 4. The influxdb creates some CPU spikes but there is plenty of power over to serve the relevant stuff and UI experience is smooth. I used to run it on a RPI 3B but that was pushing the limits a bit (both memory and CPU) at least for the influxdb database. The application is built mainly of 5 parts (For a deeper description use the READMEs below) but each individual service can be used standalone with some tweaking: - Fishfeeder - Water Control with level and tap (including watering of the garden plants) - Web Server instance - Water Quality - Atlas scientific sensors in custom casing and mounted in a Sieve filter - Pond Control which is the "controller" in this setup The interaction with the pond is mainly done via the web app where you can control timers or interactive feeding, water on/off etc."</em> <a href="https://github.com/boanjo/poseidon">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A fully integrated PCB linear actuator, with the motor driver, encoder and motor all on a single PCB. All designs are open source: Firmware and host software PCB layout and schematics, mechanical components, simulation code Motor Design and Validation Design parameters of the motor were simulated with FEMM. There are not too many free parameters to optimize, but the goal is to find some off the shelf magnets which can be used, and to estimate the importance of things like air gap on motor performance. The design ended up having the simplest possible winding layout (3 slots per pole), which maximized the amount of current carrying traces, while also having a high winding factor. 50mm * 10mm * 2mm magnets were used (which are a bit smaller in reality by ~0.5mm in each dimension), as they were easily available on EBay etc. "</em> <a href="https://benwang.dev/2022/08/09/PCB-Linear-Actuator.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A simple method for connecting nRF24L01 radio modules over the air is proposed. The nRF24L01+ RF transceiver module has a long range with low power consumption. Long range and low power consumption determine the widespread use of radio modules in mobile devices. However, many users have difficulty connecting modules over the air. The problems are evidenced by multi-page discussions in various technical forums. I am also not one of those lucky ones who easily managed to link radio modules."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/user2199899/defeat-nrf24l01-in-three-steps-35cf8f">[...]</a>
