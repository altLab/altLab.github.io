<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1745, o pioneiro francês do balão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgolfier_brothers">Jacques-Étienne Montgolfier</a>. Ele, com o seu irmão Joseph-Michel Montgolfier, desenvolveu o balão de ar quente e realizou os primeiros voos desamarrados. Uma primeira experiência com um balão de tafetá cheio de fumo quente foi feita numa demonstração pública a 5 de Junho de 1783. Seguiu-se um voo com três animais como passageiros a 19 de Setembro de 1783, exibido em Paris e testemunhado pelo Rei Luís XVI. A 21 de Novembro de 1783, o seu balão transportou os dois primeiros homens num voo desamarrado - o primeiro voo tripulado de balões. Modificações do desenho básico de Montgolfier foram incorporadas na construção de balões maiores que, em anos posteriores, levaram à exploração da atmosfera superior. Étienne também desenvolveu um processo de fabrico de vellum.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1795, o químico francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anselme_Payen">Anselme Payen</a>. Ele fez importantes contribuições para a química industrial e descobriu a celulose, um constituinte básico das células vegetais. As fábricas do seu pai produziram vários produtos químicos, e açúcar refinado, pelo que Payen estudou ciência. Em 1815, aos 20 anos, foi nomeado gerente da fábrica do seu pai para a refinação de bórax bruto importado. Aí desenvolveu uma síntese para o bórax a partir de soda e ácido bórico e em 1820 criou uma nova indústria que poderia comercializar o produto sintético a um terço do preço do bórax natural refinado. Em 1822, ele tinha encontrado o valor do carvão vegetal animal para clarificar as soluções de açúcar. Em 1833, Payen descobriu a primeira enzima, para a qual cunhou o nome de diastase. Converte amido em açúcar, e foi mais tarde (1893) chamado amilase.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1925, o fabricante de automóveis <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_DeLorean">John DeLorean</a>. Ele geriu o desenvolvimento de vários veículos ao longo da sua carreira, incluindo o Pontiac GTO muscle car, o Pontiac Firebird, Pontiac Grand Prix, Chevrolet Cosworth Vega, e por fim o DMC DeLorean sports car, que foi apresentado no filme de 1985 Back to the Future. Foi o chefe de divisão mais jovem da história da General Motors, tendo depois partido para iniciar a DeLorean Motor Company (DMC) em 1973. Os atrasos na produção significaram que o primeiro carro da DMC não chegou ao mercado consumidor até 1981, quando um mercado de compras deprimido foi agravado por má imprensa de críticos e do público. Após um ano, o DeLorean não conseguiu recuperar os seus 175 milhões de dólares de custos de investimento, acumulando carros não vendidos, e a empresa estava em dificuldades financeiras. Foram produzidos cerca de 9000 veiculos. Apesar de o carro ter uma reputação de má qualidade de construção e uma experiência de condução menos satisfatória, o DeLorean continua a ter um forte seguimento impulsionado em parte pela popularidade dos filmes Back to the Future. Estima-se que 6.500 DeLoreanos ainda se encontram na estrada.</p>

<p>Em 1838, o sistema telegráfico de Samuel Morse é demonstrado pela primeira vez na Speedwell Iron Works em Morristown, Nova Jersey. O telégrafo, um dispositivo que utilizava impulsos eléctricos para transmitir mensagens codificadas através de um fio, acabaria por revolucionar a comunicação de longa distância, atingindo o auge da sua popularidade nas décadas de 1920 e 1930.</p>

<p>E nesta primeira edição da newsletter de 2022 gostaria de passar uma vista de olhos pelo que passou mais de relevante nas 52 newsletters de 2021.</p>

<p>Em termos de electrónica DIY tivemos o lançamento do Raspberry Pi Pico e da placa Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, não esquecendo da versão 6.0 do software EDA KiCad.
O Planeta Marte foi visitado por três equipamentos lançados pelo Homem. Os Emirados Árabes Unidos enviaram a sonda "Amal". A China enviou a sonda Tianwen-1 com o rover Zhurong e por fim a NASA enviou a sonda Mars 2020 com o rover Perseverance e o helicóptero Ingenuity equipado com Linux.
A Virgin Galactic assim como a Blue Origin iniciaram as viagens espaciais comerciais conseguindo transportar até à orla exterior da atmosfera (cerca de 86 quilómetros de altitude) e trazer de volta civis à Terra. Ambas duraram alguns minutos.
Também a SpaceX lançou do SpaceX Crew Dragon Resilience com quatro norte-americanos civis. Lançada acoplada ao foguetão Falcon 9, esta missão teve o nome de baptismo "Inspiration4" e é considerada a primeira missão espacial totalmente civil. Esta missão durou 3 dias.
O final do ano de 2021 ficou ainda marcado pelo lançamento tão aguardado do Telescópio Espacial James Webb. Desenvolvido desde 1996 pela NASA com contribuições da ESA e da CSA, o telescópio irá fazer uma viagem de 1.500 milhões de quilómetros até entrar numa órbita halo a volta do Sol-Terra (Ponto de Lagrange L2) a partir de onde fará as observações.
A Microsoft lançou o Windows 11, a Canonical lançou os Ubuntu 21.04 e 21.10, a RedHat lançou o Fedora 35 e a Debian lançou o Debian 11 - Buster. O Linux fez 30 anos em 2021.</p>

<p>Esta semana decorre a CES 2022. A Intel lançou a sua 12ª geração de processadores Alder Lake . A AMD apresentou os seus novos processadores Ryzen 6000. A Sony demonstrou o seu novo conceito de SUV, o Vision-S 02, que incorpora capacidades de operação remota podendo ser controlado à distância através de redes 5G. A BMW apresentou em conjunto com a Eink um prototipo do seu novo carro, o iX, que permite controlar a cor do veiculo em tempo real alterando a apresentação do mesmo de forma dinâmica entre branco e preto. O carro representa uma nova aplicação radical da tecnologia E Ink, e embora alguns possam vê-lo como o derradeiro veículo de fuga ao modificar instantaneamente a sua tonalidade, existem algumas aplicações práticas (e mais interessantes) para um carro com mudança de cor. A utilização de branco para reflectir o Sol em dias quentes e de preto em dias frios para reter o calor do Sol faz diferença em termos de aproveitamento térmico.</p>

<p>E nesta semana que passou também recebemos a noticia que o escudo solar que o Telescópio James Webb transporta foi aberto com sucesso. Este escudo de 21 metros é um marco fundamental na sua preparação para operações científicas. O escudo solar - do tamanho aproximado de um campo de ténis em tamanho real - foi dobrado para caber dentro da área de carga útil de do foguetão Arianespace Ariane 5 antes do lançamento. A equipa Webb começou a implantar remotamente o escudo do Sol 28 de Dezembro de 2021, três dias após o lançamento.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, alguns modelos 3D, projetos de maker e alguns vídeos interessantes. É apresentado o livro de pinouts criado para designers e engenheiros como uma referência rápida para recordar as diferentes funções de pinout nos seus projectos electrónicos.</p>

Unearthing these possibilities and creating technological solutions was the goal of the Fraunhofer lighthouse project QUILT, the results of which are now available. Light can do some amazing things. For example, light particles (photons) be entangled upon creation, which connects them inextricably to one another in terms of their properties, not just across great distances, but also across different wavelength ranges. These entangled photons are the tools used by the Fraunhofer researchers in the project “QUILT – Quantum Methods for Advanced Imaging Solutions.” They are using the photons to develop quantum optical solutions for wavelength ranges that have thus far proven to be virtually inaccessible.

<p><em>"Sound waves may pave the way for topological electronic transistors Topological materials move electrons along their surface and edges without any loss, making them promising materials for dissipationless, high-efficiency electronics. Researchers are especially interested in using these materials as transistors, the backbone of all modern electronics. But there’s a problem: Transistors switch electronic current on and off, but it’s difficult to turn off the dissipationless flow of electrons in topological materials. Now, Harvard University researchers have designed and simulated the first topological acoustic transistors — with sound waves instead of electrons — and proposed a connection architecture to form a universal logic gate that can switch the flow of sound on and off. “Since the advent of topological materials around 2007, there has been a lot of interest in developing a topological electronic transistor,” said Jenny Hoffman, the Clowes Professor of Science at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) and the Department of Physics. “Although the materials we used won't yield an electronic topological transistor, our general design process applies to both quantum materials and photonic crystals, raising hopes that electronic and optical equivalents may not be far behind.” The research is published in Physical Review Letters."</em> <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2022/01/first-topological-acoustic-transistor">[...]</a>

Patricia Weisensee, assistant professor of mechanical engineering &amp; materials science, and Junhui Li, a doctoral student in her lab, made the finding after using high-speed imaging methods to study a microscopic entrapped bubble that forms when droplets of water hit a heated, smooth, water-repellant surface. Results of the research are published in the Experimental Thermal and Fluid Science Jan. 1, 2022 print issue. The bubble — only a few hundred microns in size — forms inside a water droplet from absorbing the air underneath it as it begins to lift off from the surface. “We’re creating capillary waves on the droplet, because as the droplet impacts, it compresses, and that sends a shockwave through the droplet and creates a doughnut-shaped droplet with the air bubble entrapped in the middle,” Weisensee said."</em> <a href="https://engineering.wustl.edu/news/2021/Heat-conduction-plays-prominent-role-in-droplet-dynamics.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"MIT researchers are testing a simplified turbulence theory’s ability to model complex plasma phenomena using a novel machine-learning technique. To make fusion energy a viable resource for the world’s energy grid, researchers need to understand the turbulent motion of plasmas: a mix of ions and electrons swirling around in reactor vessels. The plasma particles, following magnetic field lines in toroidal chambers known as tokamaks, must be confined long enough for fusion devices to produce significant gains in net energy, a challenge when the hot edge of the plasma (over 1 million degrees Celsius) is just centimeters away from the much cooler solid walls of the vessel. Abhilash Mathews, a PhD candidate in the Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering working at MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center (PSFC), believes this plasma edge to be a particularly rich source of unanswered questions. A turbulent boundary, it is central to understanding plasma confinement, fueling, and the potentially damaging heat fluxes that can strike material surfaces — factors that impact fusion reactor designs. To better understand edge conditions, scientists focus on modeling turbulence at this boundary using numerical simulations that will help predict the plasma's behavior."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/seeing-plasma-edge-fusion-experiments-new-ways-artificial-intelligence-0105">[...]</a>

Researchers input a material’s physical characteristics and structure, and the program produces its fundamental property constants — key values researchers need to model various materials. “Some physical models contain hundreds or thousands of redundant components, which can make the model overwhelming,” said Anubhav Roy, a doctoral student in engineering science and mechanics in the Penn State College of Engineering and first author on the paper. “The program is able to greatly reduce the number of components for any physical property that is connected to solids with inherent crystalline symmetry.” The researchers developed propSym, the details of which were published in the Journal of Applied Crystallography, after they could not find reliable information about langasite — a material used in sensing and energy harvesting devices — in a separate joint study with Sandia National Labs. “Traditionally, the relationships between fundamental constants and material symmetries are found only in appendices of textbooks or tables in journal articles,” said Christopher Kube, assistant professor of engineering science and mechanics at Penn State, who led the project."</em> <a href="https://www.psu.edu/news/engineering/story/engineers-develop-new-software-tool-aid-material-modeling-research/">[...]</a>

When two sheets of the carbon nanomaterial graphene are stacked together at a particular angle with respect to each other, it gives rise to some fascinating physics. For instance, when this so-called “magic-angle graphene” is cooled to near absolute zero, it suddenly becomes a superconductor, meaning it conducts electricity with zero resistance. Now, a research team from Brown University has found a surprising new phenomenon that can arise in magic-angle graphene. In research published in the journal Science, the team showed that by inducing a phenomenon known as spin-orbit coupling, magic-angle graphene becomes a powerful ferromagnet. “Magnetism and superconductivity are usually at opposite ends of the spectrum in condensed matter physics, and it’s rare for them to appear in the same material platform,” said Jia Li, an assistant professor of physics at Brown and senior author of the research."</em> <a href="https://www.brown.edu/news/2022-01-06/magnet">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Inspired by the natural dexterity of the human hand, a team of engineers from the National University of Singapore (NUS) has created a reconfigurable hybrid robotics system that is able to grip a variety of objects: from the small, soft and delicate to the large, heavy and bulky. This technology is expected to impact a range of industries, involving food assembly, vertical farming and fast-moving consumer goods packaging, which will progressively automate more of their operations in the coming years. Led by Associate Professor Raye Yeow from the NUS Department of Biomedical Engineering and the NUS Advanced Robotics Centre, the hybrid robotic grippers use soft, flexible 3D-printed fingers with a reconfigurable gripper base. The robotic innovation is now in the process of being brought to commercial partners under the team’s start-up RoPlus (RO+), comprising NUS researchers Low Jin Huat, Khin Phone May, Chen Chao-Yu and undergraduate student Han Qian Qian. “An object’s shape, texture, weight and size affect how we choose to grip them. This is one of the main reasons why many industries still heavily rely on human labour to package and handle delicate items,” Assoc Prof Yeow said."</em> <a href="https://news.nus.edu.sg/nus-engineers-bring-a-soft-touch-to-commercial-robotics/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"New findings on the glass phase of ‘active matter’ ends an intense debate in the soft matter physics community. Is it in a liquid phase or a ‘glassy’ phase? This question has been the subject of intense debate as physicists try to understand the behavior of so-called ‘active matter’ – a relatively new type of matter where particles use ‘a little internal engine’ to move. With a new observation – published in the prestigious journal Physical Review Letters – TU/e researchers now resolve all contradictory results at the same time, thereby paving the way towards a better understanding of cell behavior in diseases like asthma and cancer. For many, the phrase ‘phases of matter’ immediately evokes thoughts of gasses, liquids, and solids – the best-known phases of matter. Between the liquid and solid phase though, you’ll find the glass phase, a phase that behaves like a solid, but on the inside looks like a liquid."</em> <a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/news-and-events/news-overview/04-01-2022-truly-revealing-when-a-material-becomes-glassy/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Pulsed electric fields, such as the ones caused by lightning strikes, manifest themselves as voltage spikes, posing a destructive threat to electronic components and causing considerable damage. Scientists from the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR) have now discovered that such voltage spikes can also have useful properties. In the journal Physical Review Research (DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevResearch.3.033153), they report how nuclear fusion processes, for instance, can be significantly reinforced by extremely strong and fast-pulsed electric fields. Nuclear fusions, such as those taking place in the sun, are enabled by the quantum mechanical tunneling effect. “The tunneling effect can help particles of like charge to overcome their mutual repulsion even if they don’t actually have enough energy to do so – at least not according to the laws of classical mechanics,” says Prof. Ralf Schützhold, head of the Theoretical Physics Department at HZDR: “We can observe this in the fusion of two light atomic nuclei, for example: The closer one nucleus gets to another, the greater the repulsion, like a mountain piling up in front of the nucleus. This is called the potential barrier."</em> <a href="https://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pNid=99&amp;pOid=64906">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Pressure bumps’ in sun’s protoplanetary disk explain many solar system features Before the solar system had planets, the sun had rings — bands of dust and gas similar to Saturn’s rings — that likely played a role in Earth’s formation, according to a new study. “In the solar system, something happened to prevent the Earth from growing to become a much larger type of terrestrial planet called a super-Earth ,” said Rice University astrophysicist André Izidoro, referring to the massive rocky planets seen around at least 30% of sun-like stars in our galaxy. Izidoro and colleagues used a supercomputer to simulate the solar system’s formation hundreds of times. Their model, which is described in a study published online in Nature Astronomy, produced rings like those seen around many distant, young stars. It also faithfully reproduced several features of the solar system missed by many previous models, including: - An asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter containing objects from both the inner and outer solar system. - The locations and stable, almost circular orbits of Earth, Mars, Venus and Mercury."</em> <a href="https://news.rice.edu/news/2022/earth-isnt-super-because-sun-had-rings-planets">[...]</a>

A "hot" trail to explain this effect leads to a region of the solar atmosphere just below the corona, where sound waves and certain plasma waves travel at the same speed. In an experiment using the molten alkali metal rubidium and pulsed high magnetic fields, a team from the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR) has developed a laboratory model and for the first time experimentally confirmed the theoretically predicted behavior of these plasma waves – so-called Alfvén waves – as the researchers report in the journal Physical Review Letters (DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.127.275001). At 15 million degrees Celsius, the center of our Sun is unimaginably hot. At its surface, it emits its light at a comparatively moderate 6000 degrees Celsius. "It is all the more astonishing that temperatures of several million degrees suddenly prevail again in the overlying Sun's corona," says Dr. Frank Stefani."</em> <a href="https://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pNid=99&amp;pOid=64947">[...]</a>

Presumably, even the compass of migratory birds can be explained by the influence of the geomagnetic field on the magnetic interplay between these two spin states. Until now, this quantum process could not be followed directly optically and only be evaluated summarily in the final product. In the current issue of the journal Science, a research collaboration with Professor Ulrich Steiner from the University of Konstanz and researchers from the Universities of Würzburg and Novosibirsk (RUS) presents the pump-push-pulse technique, allowing for the first time to optically determine the time course of the singlet/triplet ratio. This opens up new avenues, for example in the field of organic solar cells, but also for qubits in quantum computers.

<p><em>"Islands of inactive lithium creep like worms to reconnect with their electrodes, restoring a battery’s capacity and lifespan. Researchers at the Department of Energy’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and Stanford University may have found a way to revitalize rechargeable lithium batteries, potentially boosting the range of electric vehicles and battery life in next-gen electronic devices. As lithium batteries cycle, they accumulate little islands of inactive lithium that are cut off from the electrodes, decreasing the battery’s capacity to store charge. But the research team discovered that they could make this “dead” lithium creep like a worm toward one of the electrodes until it reconnects, partially reversing the unwanted process. Adding this extra step slowed the degradation of their test battery and increased its lifetime by nearly 30%. “We are now exploring the potential recovery of lost capacity in lithium-ion batteries using an extremely fast discharging step,” said Stanford postdoctoral fellow Fang Liu, the lead author of a study published Dec. 22 in Nature."</em> <a href="https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/news/2022-01-03-revitalizing-batteries-bringing-dead-lithium-back-life.aspx">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Arduino Nano or ATTiny85 sounds a buzzer if the Tesla is in the garage for more than 30 minutes without being plugged in. I built this project because my wife and I sometimes forget to plug in our Tesla after parking it in the garage (I forget, she just doesn’t do it). It usually happens when we unload groceries because I wait to plug in until after the bags are out of the trunk, otherwise the charging cable is a trip hazard and the charge plug could get bumped. We tried setting a reminder alarm for 8PM every evening but it eventually became background noise. I wish Tesla would add some code to their phone app to remind me to plug in the car. This issue has been discussed numerous times on the Tesla forums but nothing has been done."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/thedalles77/tesla-battery-charge-reminder-347bca">[...]</a>

While it was convenient to plug this in and access it from Python using pyaudio, the sound quality from this mic was terrible. Extremely noisy with poor (distance) sensitivity.

<p><em>"Cooling FAN Controller Using an LM35 (No MCU) The high temperature of the power components is a known phenomenon in electronics. To overcome this challenge, the designers mount heatsinks on the components to dissipate the heat, however, in many commercial and home appliance devices, the embedded heatsink is not adequate and the air must be circulated faster to reduce the heatsink and component temperature, otherwise, the lifetime of the component is reduced significantly. The proposed automatic FAN controller board is simple, compact, and can be embedded inside commercial devices. The LM35 temperature sensor could be fixed on the heatsink using some silicon glue. The user can easily set the temperature threshold using a potentiometer. The board can be supplied using a 5V or a 12V supply, therefore a variety of 5V, 12V, miniature, and PC FANs can be used."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/hesam-moshiri/cooling-fan-controller-using-an-lm35-no-mcu-133152">[...]</a>
