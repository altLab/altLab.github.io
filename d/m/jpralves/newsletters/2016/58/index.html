<p>Esta semana foi lançado ao mar o Solar Voyager a partir de perto de Boston nos EUA. Trata-se de um navio robótico que usa energia solar para se movimentar e que irá fazer uma viagem no oceano Atlântico até Lisboa - onde chegará, se tudo correr bem, pelo Outono. A sua viagem pode ser acompanhada <a href="http://www.solar-voyager.com/trackatlantic.html">aqui</a>. A AirBUS construiu o primeiro drone impresso em 3D. Designado por THOR, este drone tem cerca de 4 metros de comprimento e pesa cerca de 21 quilos. A KnuEdge apresentou um processador - o KNUPATH™ LambdaFabric - que permite, usando uma arquitectura fundamentalmente diferente, criar data centers com capacidades de computação neuronal para suportar avanços em <em>machine learning</em>, IoT e processamento de sinal.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. Na rubrica "Documentação" apresentamos oito livros (eBooks) que podem ser descarregados livremente e que esta semana são sobre Windows Azure, fundamentos de Bases de Dados e desenvolvimento de aplicações em GTK+ / Gnome.</p>

<p><img src="NS58_SolarVoyagerAutonomousBoatLook.jpg" alt="NS58_SolarVoyagerAutonomousBoatLook" /></p>

<p><em>"About 200 miles due east of Boston, a robotic boat is putting along at a walking pace on what could be an historic journey across the entire Atlantic. “Solar Voyager,” built by two friends in their spare time, would be the first autonomous vessel to cross that ocean — and the first one to cross any ocean using solar power alone. Isaac Penny and Christopher Sam Soon have been tinkering away on the project for four years now and, while the craft, which they launched on June 1, still has a long way to go, it’s safe to say it’s already a success in many ways. Nevertheless, the two built Solar Voyager from scratch, with only the solar panels and some standard motor parts taken off the shelf. The 18-foot boat is slowly making its way between GPS waypoints and, if all goes well, it should arrive in Portugal this fall."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="NS58_AirbusOfficiallyUnveilsThorThe.jpg" alt="NS58_AirbusOfficiallyUnveilsThorThe" /></p>

<p><em>"The first 3D printed plane is making its debut, and nope, it’s not another one that’s been made in miniature by a hobbyist. And while it’s not full-scale, it’s certainly presenting a huge milestone to the world as a 13-foot flying drone. It’s also the perfect example of how a company like Airbus is able to use every benefit of 3D printing in creating what is obviously just a stepping stone to their eventual fleet of futuristic 3D printed jets."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT58_RobotsGetCreativeToCutThroughC.jpg" alt="CT58_RobotsGetCreativeToCutThroughC" /></p>

<p><em>"Clutter is a special challenge for robots, but new Carnegie Mellon University software is helping robots cope, whether they're beating a path across the moon or grabbing a milk jug from the back of the refrigerator. The software not only helped a robot deal efficiently with clutter, but it also surprisingly revealed the robot's creativity in solving problems."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT58_HotNewSolarCell.jpg" alt="CT58_HotNewSolarCell" /></p>

<p><em>"A team of MIT researchers has for the first time demonstrated a device based on a method that enables solar cells to break through a theoretically predicted ceiling on how much sunlight they can convert into electricity. Ever since 1961 it has been known that there is an absolute theoretical limit, called the Shockley-Queisser Limit, to how efficient traditional solar cells can be in their energy conversion. For a single-layer cell made of silicon — the type used for the vast majority of today’s solar panels — that upper limit is about 32 percent. But it has also been known that there are some possible avenues to increase that overall efficiency, such as by using multiple layers of cells, a method that is being widely studied, or by converting the sunlight first to heat before generating electrical power. It is the latter method, using devices known as solar thermophotovoltaics, or STPVs, that the team has now demonstrated."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT58_BiomoleculaLigadaADoencasNeuro.jpg" alt="CT58_BiomoleculaLigadaADoencasNeuro" /></p>

<p><em>"Pesquisadores do Laboratório Nacional de Nanotecnologia (LNNano) desenvolveram um dispositivo eletrônico simples para a detecção de um par de biomoléculas relacionadas a diversos tipos de câncer e a doenças neurodegenerativas, como o Alzheimer e Parkinson. O desenvolvimento é baseado em um transistor com uma camada orgânica em escala nanométrica que, em meio líquido, pode identificar facilmente o peptídeo glutationa reduzida (GSH) e a enzima glutationa S-transferase (GST). Diferente de transistores convencionais, que são formados por multicamadas de diversos materiais, o dispositivo desenvolvido no LNNano possui apenas um par de contatos elétricos cobertos por uma camada orgânica, o que simplifica a fabricação do transistor. Nessa arquitetura, o filme orgânico é exposto em meio líquido, onde há um terceiro eletrodo para a detecção do par de biomoléculas."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT58_DiamondsCloserToBecomingIdealS.jpg" alt="CT58_DiamondsCloserToBecomingIdealS" /></p>

<p><em>"Along with being a "girl's best friend," diamonds also have remarkable properties that could make them ideal semiconductors. This is welcome news for electronics; semiconductors are needed to meet the rising demand for more efficient electronics that deliver and convert power. The thirst for electronics is unlikely to cease and almost every appliance or device requires a suite of electronics that transfer, convert and control power. Now, researchers have taken an important step toward that technology with a new way to dope single crystals of diamonds, a crucial process for building electronic devices."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT58_MakingBetterBatteriesAReality.jpg" alt="CT58_MakingBetterBatteriesAReality" /></p>

<p><em>"University of California, Irvine researchers have invented nanowire-based battery material that can be recharged hundreds of thousands of times, moving us closer to a battery that would never require replacement. The breakthrough work could lead to commercial batteries with greatly lengthened lifespans for computers, smartphones, appliances, cars and spacecraft. Scientists have long sought to use nanowires in batteries. Thousands of times thinner than a human hair, they’re highly conductive and feature a large surface area for the storage and transfer of electrons. However, these filaments are extremely fragile and don’t hold up well to repeated discharging and recharging, or cycling. In a typical lithium-ion battery, they expand and grow brittle, which leads to cracking."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://news.wisc.edu/fast-stretchy-circuits-could-yield-new-wave-of-wearable-electronics/">Fast, stretchy circuits could yield new wave of wearable electronics</a></p>

<p><img src="CT58_FastStretchyCircuitsCouldYield.jpg" alt="CT58_FastStretchyCircuitsCouldYield" /></p>

<p><em>"The consumer marketplace is flooded with a lively assortment of smart wearable electronics that do everything from monitor vital signs, fitness or sun exposure to play music, charge other electronics or even purify the air around you — all wirelessly. Now, a team of University of Wisconsin—Madison engineers has created the world’s fastest stretchable, wearable integrated circuits, an advance that could drive the Internet of Things and a much more connected, high-speed wireless world."</em></p></li>

You should be comfortable with programming (data structures, algorithms, etc.) and with the C programming language before you try to read it. It's also helpful to have had some introductory exposure to GTK+, via the online tutorial or Eric Harlow's book Developing Linux Applications with GTK+ and GDK (buy from Amazon). However, if you know C and are willing to jump right in you could start with my book, perhaps in conjunction with the GTK+ reference documentation."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="MP58_GloboidThroatedWormDriveModel.jpg" alt="MP58_GloboidThroatedWormDriveModel" /></p>

<p>This is a fully functional hand-cranked model of the throated (also known as globoid) worm drive. To put it together, you will also need 10 metric Phillips flat head screws M2x12 and 2 metric nuts M2. Those can be purchased cheaply on eBay.</p>

<p>If you are curious how to model a throated worm drive, we have a video tutorial at www.otvinta.com.</p>

<p>We recommend that the two halves of the worm shaft be printed with a raft for better coupling. The raft and remaining residue should be removed with sand paper.</p>

<p>If printed properly, the crankhandle's grip should rotate freely around the handle.</p>

<p>File parts clamp1.stl and clamp2.stl in the archive are identical. There are two versions of the stand: with the logo (stand.stl) and without (stand_nologo.stl). Print one or the other.</p>

When I browsed the circuit literature in the area, I came across the Silicon Labs collection. One of their chips, the Si4844-A10 caught my attention. This receiver has AM/FM/SW capability with all the bells and whistles and it is designed to work with a microprocessor.

<p><em>"Many hobbyists will have come across an op-amp circuit that uses a dual rail supply. In order to provide the dual rails power, two power supplies can be used but many do not have access to such equipment or the design needs to be portable and thus two individual power supplies may not be ideal. One solution is to split the incoming power supply and create a virtual ground between two resistors in a potential divider. However, this solution has some issues. Firstly, the current sinking / sourcing capability of the virtual ground is limited and, secondly, the supply voltage has been divided by 2 (for example, a 9V battery could become 4.5V but 4.5V is the maximum achievable voltage). But using an oscillator, some diodes, and a clever arrangement of capacitors, we can exploit an effect called capacitive coupling whereby a negative voltage near equal to the supply voltage can be generated... from a single rail supply!"</em></p></li>

<p><em>"First, lets go over a few basics. An oscilloscope is a tool for visualizing changing electrical signals. Oscilloscope: Oscillation (changing), scope (viewing). Together they make "oscilloscope"! An oscilloscope works by plotting a voltage over time. That way, you can very easily visualize signals. On older analog scopes, they actually deflect an beam of electrons to make a moving dot on a phosphorescent screen to create a line. But newer digital oscilloscopes still work in pretty much the same way. Oscilloscopes are a very important tool in electronics because they allow engineers and technicians to see the electrical pulses and signals that occur inside electric circuits, even when they occur very rapidly. It is an essential tool for electronics debugging, and is used by anyone who wants to better understand an electrical system. In this instructable, I'll be showing you how I got mine to display simple vector graphics with only an arduino and some resistors!"</em></p></li>

<p><img src="PM58_SimpleThermostatUsingArduino.jpg" alt="PM58_SimpleThermostatUsingArduino" /></p>

<p><em>"The objective of this project is to create a thermostat that measures the temperature of a light bulb while using two threshold temperatures (tL being a low threshold variable and tH being a high threshold variable), that will cause the light bulb to fluctuate between tL and tH. If the temperature of the light bulb is below tH it will remain on until its temperature exceeds the tH value. Once the tH temperature is reached or exceeded the light bulb will turn off until its temperature is equal to or less than the tL threshold value. Before starting this project I honestly had barely touched an Arduino. I was very intimidated by the idea of working with circuitry, and electronics in general. This project really pushed me to learn about a lot of different electronic components (I had never heard of a MOFSET before!), and to learn how to write my own code and personalize this! I am so glad that I got the chance to explore just one of the possibilities that Arduino can offer!"</em></p></li>

<p><img src="PM58_EmergencyFallNotifierComePanic.jpg" alt="PM58_EmergencyFallNotifierComePanic" /></p>

<p><em>"Every year, one-third to one-half of the population aged 65 and over experience falls. Falls are the leading cause of injury in older adults and the leading cause of accidental death in those 75 years of age and older. For a human, experiencing a fall unobserved can be doubly dangerous. The obvious possibility of initial injury may be further aggravated by the possible consequences if treatment is not obtained within a short time. Statistics show that the majority of serious consequences are not the direct result of falling, but rather are due to a delay in assistance and treatment. Post-fall consequences can be greatly reduced if relief personnel can be alerted in time. Many elderly live alone either in an apartment or a smaller house after their children have grown up and left home. It is not uncommon after a fall that an elderly person is unable to get up by themselves or summon help. There is therefore a need for an automatic fall detection system in which a patient can summon help even if they are unconscious or unable to get up after the fall. Many algorithms have been developed bu till now it is difficult to distinguish real falls from certain fall-like activities such as sitting down quickly and jumping, resulting in many false positives. Most of the algorithms use accelerometer to detect fall with body orientation, but it is not very useful when the ending position is not horizontal, e.g. falls happen on stairs. I made a novel fall detection system using both accelerometers and gyroscopes and for that my algorithm reduces both false positives and false negatives, while improving fall detection accuracy. My system instantly notifies to a concern person with SMS and Email when fall occurred. It has also a panic button and an emergency notification can be sent by pressing it."</em></p></li>

One modern microcontroller can replace several tens of square inches pcb real-eatate of old DIL packages! It was also a real buzz getting the Arduino to the point where it could read and write to the SRAM, just using a couple of shift registers and an octal bidirectional buffer. There's mileage in this concept - and something I wish to explore further. The plan is that the Arduino acts as a support IC for the Z80 - even allowing the Z80 assembly language to be stored in the Arduino flash, and programmed across the "Magic Bus" into the Z80's accompanying SRAM, in a few tens of milliseconds before the Z80 is released from reset - and allowed to start program execution.

<p><em>"Over the last year I have standardised on the ESP8266 for all my small IoT projects. Its low price, ease of use (now that the Arduino IDE is available), tiny size and built in Wi-Fi makes it a compelling option. Using Wi-Fi is a convenient way to link your newly created IoT device into your existing IT infrastructure  including cloud services  but it also has a drawback. Wi-Fis demand for power usually makes battery operation impractical for any real deployment. I have been able to get around this issue for most of my projects (e.g. the train and the smart shelf described on this blog) because they are for demonstration purposes only, requiring the battery to last no longer than a few hours. Nevertheless, it is possible to put the ESP8266 into deep sleep and wake up periodically to check and activate Wi-Fi only when required. This would suit a scenario in which an IoT sensor sends relatively infrequent one way traffic (i.e. where real time control of the device is not needed).  I wrote about the ESP8266 deep sleep option more than a year ago, but have not explored it any more until recently, when exactly such a project arose."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"Data communication between electronic devices is inevitable in many electronic projects and brings a lot of advantages to your project i.e. connecting your microcontroller to PC and monitor data on a large colorful display instead of small monochrome LCD. When talking about connecting a device to PC, the most obvious way of communicating is USB port. But transmitting data over USB requires lots of programming. Another easy way is Serial Port (aka COM) and RS232 protocol that only needs a tiny electronic circuit to convert voltage levels and a little programming. So I made an RSS232-TTL UART adapter and published here to uses in all of my projects. But I faced a new problem, new motherboards and laptops have no COM port. Then I decided to make a USB-TTL UART adapter using famous FT232 IC for my projects. It works very well, but long wires from devices to PC are annoying me.

<p><em>"We were invited to help out at our local elementary school's STEM night, and needed a cool demonstration, with little time to prepare. So, we looked through the tech we had laying around, and came up with the idea of using the LeapMotion hand tracking sensor, to control the color and intensity of RGB lights. There is no better way to get kids excited about science, technology, engineering, and math, than having a fun and interactive hands on example."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"If you're anything like me, you've probably got various LEDs knocking around left over from previous projects or salvaged from equipment. Some of them you might have had for years, and others might be clear ones and you've long since lost track of what colour they are, what is their forward voltage, and whether they even still work. True, it's easy to knock up an improvised LED tester with a battery and a resistor, and preferably a breadboard or a few clip leads, but first you've got to find those bits. Much nicer, then, to have a ready made tester which cost you next to nothing to build and can take power from a computer's USB port, a USB charger or a USB power bank."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"This instructable show you how I have created a box controlled remote by a TV infrared transmitter. I have taken inspiration by this instructable Control Any Circuit With a TV Remote (and an Arduino). In this link you can discover library lets you decode the signal coming from your remote and instruction to download and install the library zip file. The aim of this project is recycle of old components and turn these in electronic reusable modules."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"The Infinity String Art is the union of an Infinity Mirror with UV LEDs and String Art. The optical effect desired is an infinite reflection of a glowing string art. The main idea is to put a String Art between the mirror and the reflective glass of an Infinity Mirror. Please tell me in the comments what you think about the project, the tutorial, my English or anything related to this Instructable. Don't hesitate to ask questions too, I'll reply as soon as possible(which is usually in the next few hours)."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"This guide is for anyone who has ever rolled over a log to see what lies underneath. What happens when you're not looking? Watch the video above, then dig in (hehe) to this guide and build your own Rhizotron* (SoilCam)! How does one capture video underground? Waterproof and bury a normal document scanner. Combine a Raspberry Pi Computer and a few amazing software tools to automate the scanning and creation of a time-lapse video! The Raspberry Pi uses a Linux Operating System (Raspbian), an OS that it and much of the software written for makes automating tasks much easier! If you have never used the Linux OS, or don't feel terribly comfortable with technology fear not! The Pi is designed to make learning easy, you may want to spend some time reading up on the Pi, the terminal, and various linux commands before proceeding. The videos in the following steps are intended for people new to Linux. For those already familiar with, you can probably skim through the pictures."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"Ive created a mobile, Pi-based FLiR camera for our engineering team to use for testing and troubleshooting. Really, I want to show the process of engineering rather than the product, so this week its a video! The project files are hosted as a FLiRPiCam GitHub repository, which will be updated as I continue the process outlined in the video and add features like MOSFET switching for my batteries and a fully developed user application. Even so, the project is fully buildable from the GitHub, including 3D printing models, code and hardware  though it is an advanced project."</em></p></li>
