<p><img src="NS64_DeepmindAiReducesGoogleDataCen.jpg" alt="NS64_DeepmindAiReducesGoogleDataCen" /></p>

<p><em>"From smartphone assistants to image recognition and translation, machine learning already helps us in our everyday lives. But it can also help us to tackle some of the world’s most challenging physical problems -- such as energy consumption.  Large-scale commercial and industrial systems like data centres consume a lot of energy, and while much has been done to stem the growth of energy use, there remains a lot more to do given the world’s increasing need for computing power. Reducing energy usage has been a major focus for us over the past  10 years: we have built our own super-efficient servers at Google, invented more efficient ways to cool our data centres and invested heavily in green energy sources, with the goal of being powered 100 percent by renewable energy. Compared to five years ago, we now get around 3.5 times the computing power out of the same amount of energy, and we continue to make many improvements each year. Major breakthroughs, however, are few and far between -- which is why we are excited to share that by applying DeepMind’s machine learning to our own Google data centres, we’ve managed to reduce the amount of energy we use for cooling by up to 40 percent. In any large scale energy-consuming environment, this would be a huge improvement. Given how sophisticated Google’s data centres are already, it’s a phenomenal step forward."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"Mars at midday. Or, rather, mid-sol. Welcome to Chryse Planitia, as humans first saw it 40 years ago today, when the first robot from Earth landed on the Red Planet. Viking 1 was supposed to land on July 4, the bicentennial of the Declaration of Independence, but its original landing site was too rocky. The probe orbited Mars a while longer until its human managers could find a flatter, safer spot, and this is the one they came up with. On the very same day seven years prior, humans had landed on the moon, another feat that also remains astonishing. Think about that: In less than a decade, people went to the moon and sent a robot to Mars, and we saw video of the surfaces of two alien worlds for the first time."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"With an eye to the next generation of tech gadgetry, a team of physicists at The University of Texas at Austin has had the first-ever glimpse into what happens inside an atomically thin semiconductor device. In doing so, they discovered that an essential function for computing may be possible within a space so small that it’s effectively one-dimensional."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"Harvard researchers have identified a whole new class of high-performing organic molecules, inspired by vitamin B2, that can safely store electricity from intermittent energy sources like solar and wind power in large batteries. The development builds on previous work in which the team developed a high-capacity flow battery that stored energy in organic molecules called quinones and a food additive called ferrocyanide. That advance was a game-changer, delivering the first high-performance, non-flammable, non-toxic, non-corrosive, and low-cost chemicals that could enable large-scale, inexpensive electricity storage. While the versatile quinones show great promise for flow batteries, Harvard researchers continued to explore other organic molecules in pursuit of even better performance. But finding that same versatility in other organic systems has been challenging."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT64_SmallestHardDiskToDateWritesIn.jpg" alt="CT64_SmallestHardDiskToDateWritesIn" /></p>

<p><em>"very day, modern society creates more than a billion gigabytes of new data. To store all this data, it is increasingly important that each single bit occupies as little space as possible. A team of scientists at the Kavli Institute of Nanoscience at Delft University managed to bring this reduction to the ultimate limit: they built a memory of 1 kilobyte (8,000 bits), where each bit is represented by the position of one single chlorine atom. “In theory, this storage density would allow all books ever created by humans to be written on a single post stamp”, says lead-scientist Sander Otte. They reached a storage density of 500 Terabits per square inch (Tbpsi), 500 times better than the best commercial hard disk currently available. His team reports on this memory in Nature Nanotechnology on Monday July 18."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"After learning new software and programming languages, Stanford students in the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory have an opportunity to choose a creative task and design a robot to perform the task for demonstration. The tasks call for a wide range of fundamental skills, but generally require the robot to sense where it is in space, detect objects around it, and then autonomously interact with those objects in its environment. Recent projects include placing dominoes, playing the xylophone, and sketching out an image."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"Over the years software systems have evolutionarily become more and more complex. One of the techniques for dealing with this inherent complexity of software systems is dependency injection – a design pattern that allows the removal of hard-coded dependencies and makes it possible to assemble a service by changing dependencies easily, whether at run-time or compile-time. It promotes code reuse and loosely-coupled design which leads to more easily maintainable and flexible code. The guide you are holding in your hands is a primer on using dependency injection with Unity – a lightweight extensible dependency injection container built by the Microsoft patterns &amp; practices team. It covers various styles of dependency injection and also additional capabilities of Unity container, such as object lifetime management, interception, and registration by convention. It also discusses the advanced topics of enhancing Unity with your custom extensions. "</em></p></li>

<p><em>"This ebook is for anyone whose responsibilities include training people to use Windows 10. That group includes full-time professional trainers, of course, but it also includes IT pros and those brave souls who staff the help desk in corporations. Most of all, it includes the incredibly large population of people who have earned a reputation for being “the person who knows Windows.” With that knowledge comes a seemingly endless stream of questions from friends, family, and coworkers. As Windows 10 moves into its second full year and begins to take over an increasing share of the installed base of PCs, many of those questions are going to begin “How do I…”"</em></p></li>

<p><em>"Minecraft is the biggest game on the planet with more than 30 million copies sold across numerous hardware platforms. Not bad for a sandbox that doesn’t really have a point. The version of Minecraft available for Raspberry Pi is different. Firstly it’s entirely free and secondly it comes with a powerful API, which allows you to hack and make entire virtual worlds with a few simple lines of code. In this book you’ll learn how to do some amazing things, including controlling things in the real world using the Raspberry Pi’s GPIO pins, make your own mini games and just about anything else you can imagine."</em></p></li>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1680823">Customizeable Pipe Bender (for Heatpipes)</a></h2>

<p><img src="MP64_CustomizeablePipeBenderForHeat.jpg" alt="MP64_CustomizeablePipeBenderForHeat" /></p>

<p>Parametric, fully 3D printable Pipe Bender I designed last Sunday to fight boredom and save 20€.</p>

<p>Bending radius should be more than 3 times the diameter of the heatpipe and no more than 90 degrees.</p>

<p>Three holes for up to 6mm, up to 8mm and up to 10mm heatpipe diameter.</p>

<p>Tolerance of 0.2mm worked fine for a Replicator 5th (no sanding nor drilling required).
Adjust it to your needs in the OpenScad file or with the Customizer.</p>

<p>I'll upload the .stl files for a radius of 30mm, you can change it to your specific value in the OpenScad file or with the Customizer.</p>

<p>Update1 (RC2.scad):
Rounded the bending lever for smoother results.</p>

<p>Update2 (RC3.scad):
Set the default back to r=30mm and updated the .stl</p>

<p>Update3 (RC4.scad):
Turned the lever 90 degrees again for easier printing of the axle mounting hole</p>

<p>Update4 (RC5.scad):
Bending lever is rounded only on the backside now as it should be</p>

<p>Update5 (RC6.scad):
Fixed an error for high radius bending lever and tolerance variable is a constricted slider now</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1667417">Customizable PC Bay Drawer</a></h2>

<p><img src="MP64_CustomizablePcBayDrawer.jpg" alt="MP64_CustomizablePcBayDrawer" /></p>

<p>This is a customizable drawer that can be used with any 5.25" PC drive bay. Many computers have additional bays so why not put them to use?. This drawer was created to store PC related parts like USB keys, and SD cards.</p>

<p>The dimensions for the drawer were measured for an ANTEC 300 PC tower. Make sure to measure your PC bays and use the Customizer to adjust the drawer size to meet your needs.</p>

<p>Note: the drawer can take a long time to render when using OpenSCAD. To improve rendering times either reduce the number of holes added to the front face of the drawer or remove the holes on the front face altogether. The front face holes are entirely cosmetic, they were added to match the front grill of my PC case.</p>

<p>Edit 2016/07/18</p>

<p>I've added a new drawer option which will add a hole rather than a tab or handle for the drawer. This way you can still open the drawer but there won't be a tab or handle that could potentially break off.</p>

I had also read various things about blue light, most prominently in the whole screens keeping children awake in the evening thing, but also in a few otherplaces. Having seen the sun come up a time or two, the blue light before the sun rises can be pretty spectacular and so I figured I could try and do something like that to help me wake up naturally rather than with the massive jolt that my current alarm clock induces with its, frankly, terrifying sound."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"What Id like to do for this crazy/ambitions project is turn an old cell phone into a smartwatch. So obviously an old cell phone is required. The primary reason for this project is simply that I had an old cell phone laying around and wanted to find a creative way to repurpose it. The one I had is a Nokia 1100, but most other old cell phones would work, so long as you can find the schematics for the LCD online. Taking apart the 1100, there werent too many scavenge-able parts to choose from. First and foremost, there was the LCD screen, then I was also able to extract a vibrating motor, a small speaker, as well as a protective cover for the LCD. What youre able to scavenge really depends on what type of phone you have, and how old it is. The older the phone, the more scavenge-able parts you will find."</em></p></li>

I found many solutions, but none of them were really suited to my requirements. As you might know, I developed my own library called aREST to control most of the wireless projects I make. Therefore, I decided to modify this library to be able to control projects from outside of a local WiFi network. In this article, I will share those new features of aREST with you, and show you how to control a simple relay from anywhere.

When any of SW1-SW4 (S1-S4) tact switch is pressed the, power is applied to encoder IC and RF transmitter module, the encoder then starts scanning Jumper J1-J8 and transmitting the status of the 8 bits address and data serially. The decoder IC receives the data and compares two times with J1-J8 address jumpers and provides outputs high and also VT LED goes On, if the data is Valid and address of Transmitter and Receiver are same. It is important to have same jumper settings J1-J8 at transmitter and receiver to pair both. Multiple remote can be used to control devices at same location by changing the address codes.

<p><em>"This is an easy little project for Arduino beginners that only costs about $12 to make. When a person enters the correct code on the keypad, the box will play a secret message. It could be used as part of a scavenger hunt or could be modified to trigger a door to open or trigger a servo with just a few changes. I used an Arduino Mini Pro for my project, but I think an Arduino Nano is a better choice for most beginners because it has a build in USB port for easy programming, so I wrote this instructable with that in mind even though some of my pictures show a Mini Pro."</em></p></li>
