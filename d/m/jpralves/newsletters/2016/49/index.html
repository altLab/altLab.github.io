<li><p><a href="https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/inside-pascal/">Inside Pascal: NVIDIA’s Newest Computing Platform</a></p>

<p><img src="NS49_InsidePascalNvidiasNewestCompu.jpg" alt="NS49_InsidePascalNvidiasNewestCompu" /></p>

<p><em>"Today at the 2016 GPU Technology Conference in San Jose, NVIDIA CEO Jen-Hsun Huang announced the new NVIDIA Tesla P100, the most advanced accelerator ever built. Based on the new NVIDIA Pascal GP100 GPU and powered by ground-breaking technologies, Tesla P100 delivers the highest absolute performance for HPC, technical computing, deep learning, and many computationally intensive datacenter workloads."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://news.mit.edu/2016/first-3d-printed-robots-made-of-both-solids-and-liquids-0406">First-ever 3-D printed robots made of both solids and liquids</a></p>

<p><img src="NS49_FirstEver3DPrintedRobotsMadeOf.jpg" alt="NS49_FirstEver3DPrintedRobotsMadeOf" /></p>

<p><em>"One reason we don’t yet have robot personal assistants buzzing around doing our chores is because making them is hard. Assembling robots by hand is time-consuming, while automation — robots building other robots — is not yet fine-tuned enough to make robots that can do complex tasks. But if humans and robots can’t do the trick, what about 3-D printers? This 3-D hexapod robot moves via a single motor, which spins a crankshaft that pumps fluid to the robot’s legs. Besides the motor and battery, every component is printed in a single step with no assembly required. Among the robot’s key parts are several sets of “bellows” 3-D printed directly into its body. To propel the robot, the bellows uses fluid pressure that is translated into a mechanical force. (As an alternative to the bellows, the team also demonstrated they could 3-D print a gear pump that can produce continuous fluid flow.)"</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.sammobile.com/2016/04/05/samsung-is-working-on-smart-contact-lenses-patent-filing-reveals/">Samsung is working on smart contact lenses, patent filing reveals</a></p>

<p><img src="NS49_SamsungIsWorkingOnSmartContact.jpg" alt="NS49_SamsungIsWorkingOnSmartContact" /></p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>"In an ever expanding universe of wearables, Samsung is doing its best to keep all bases covered. Today, the publication of a patent application shows the company is developing smart contact lenses. The patent application, filed in South Korea, shows a contact lens equipped with a tiny display, a camera, an antenna, and several sensors that detect movement and the most basic form of input using your eyes: blinking. The display projects images directly into the eye of the wearer. An external device, a smartphone, is needed for processing."</em></p>

<p><img src="CT49_NasaEngineersTappedToBuildFirs.jpg" alt="CT49_NasaEngineersTappedToBuildFirs" /></p>

<p><em>"A NASA team has been tapped to build a new type of communications modem that will employ an emerging, potentially revolutionary technology that could transform everything from telecommunications, medical imaging, advanced manufacturing to national defense. The space agency’s first-ever integrated-photonics modem will be tested aboard the International Space Station beginning in 2020 as part of NASA’s multi-year Laser Communications Relay Demonstration, or LCRD. The cell phone-sized device incorporates optics-based functions, such as lasers, switches, and wires, onto a microchip — much like an integrated circuit found in all electronics hardware. Once aboard the space station, the so-called Integrated LCRD LEO (Low-Earth Orbit) User Modem and Amplifier (ILLUMA) will serve as a low-Earth orbit terminal for NASA’s LCRD, demonstrating yet another capability for high-speed, laser-based communications."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT49_DeliveringGenesAcrossTheBloodB.jpg" alt="CT49_DeliveringGenesAcrossTheBloodB" /></p>

<p><em>"Caltech biologists have modified a harmless virus in such a way that it can successfully enter the adult mouse brain through the bloodstream and deliver genes to cells of the nervous system. The virus could help researchers map the intricacies of the brain and holds promise for the delivery of novel therapeutics to address diseases such as Alzheimer's and Huntington's. In addition, the screening approach the researchers developed to identify the virus could be used to make additional vectors capable of targeting cells in other organs. - See more at: https://www.caltech.edu/news/delivering-genes-across-blood-brain-barrier-49679#sthash.yNmB2LHg.dpuf"</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT49_TowardHackProofRfidChips.jpg" alt="CT49_TowardHackProofRfidChips" /></p>

<p><em>"MIT researchers have developed a new type of radio frequency identification (RFID) chip that is extremely difficult to hack. If such chips were widely adopted, it could mean that an identity thief couldn’t steal your credit card number or key card information by sitting next to you at a café, and high-tech burglars couldn’t swipe expensive goods from a warehouse and replace them with dummy tags."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/stories/waterloo-physicists-discover-new-properties">Waterloo physicists discover new properties of superconductivity</a></p>

<p><img src="CT49_WaterlooPhysicistsDiscoverNewP.jpg" alt="CT49_WaterlooPhysicistsDiscoverNewP" /></p>

<p><em>"Superconductivity could have implications for creating technologies like ultra-efficient power grids and magnetically levitating vehicles. Physicists at the University of Waterloo have led an international team that has come closer to understanding the mystery of how superconductivity, an exotic state that allows electricity to be conducted with practically zero resistance, occurs in certain materials."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/ucla-researchers-release-open-source-code-for-powerful-image-detection-algorithm">UCLA researchers release open source code for powerful image detection algorithm</a></p>

<p><img src="CT49_UclaResearchersReleaseOpenSour.jpg" alt="CT49_UclaResearchersReleaseOpenSour" /></p>

<p><em>"A UCLA Engineering research group has made public the computer code for an algorithm that helps computers process images at high speeds and “see” them in ways that human eyes cannot. The researchers say the code could eventually be used in face, fingerprint and iris recognition for high-tech security, as well as in self-driving cars’ navigation systems or for inspecting industrial products. The algorithm performs a mathematical operation that identifies objects’ edges and then detects and extracts their features. It also can enhance images and recognize objects’ textures. The algorithm was developed by a group led by Bahram Jalali, a UCLA professor of electrical engineering and holder of the Northrop-Grumman Chair in Optoelectronics, and senior researcher Mohammad Asghari."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2014/03/bioengineer-designs-diagnostic-microscope-costing-less-than-1.html">Bioengineer designs diagnostic microscope costing less than $1</a></p>

<p><img src="CT49_BioengineerDesignsDiagnosticMi.jpg" alt="CT49_BioengineerDesignsDiagnosticMi" /></p>

<p><em>"It’s an invention that would make TV’s secret agent MacGyver proud: a fully functional microscope that can be assembled from folded paper and a tiny bead of glass. And it only costs about 50 cents. By adding a watch battery, a light-emitting diode and an on/off switch, it can be configured to diagnose blood-borne diseases such as malaria, African sleeping sickness, schistosomiasis and Chagas — all for under a dollar. The Foldscope is the brainchild of Manu Prakash, PhD, assistant professor of bioengineering. He developed the idea during medical need-finding trips to India, Thailand, Uganda and Nigeria with graduate students James Cybulski and James Clements. During the trip, the team witnessed the deadly toll of infectious diseases including malaria, and noted that many of the remote villages couldn’t afford conventional microscopes or rapid diagnostics tests."</em></p></li>

<h1 id="Modelos-3D">Modelos 3D <a href="#topo">^</a></h1>

<p>Com a disponibilidade de ferramentas que permitem dar azo a nossa imaginação na criação de peças 3D e espaços como o <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/">thingiverse</a> para as publicar, esta rubrica apresenta alguns modelos selecionados que poderão ser úteis.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1466238">Magic boxes</a></h2>

<p><img src="MP49_MagicBoxes.jpg" alt="MP49_MagicBoxes" /></p>

<p>One day, my 8-year-old daughter showed me her origami and called it magic boxes. She took a video to explain why it's magic.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1463277">Adjustable Cable Holder</a></h2>

<p><img src="MP49_AdjustableCableHolder.jpg" alt="MP49_AdjustableCableHolder" /></p>

<p>I've watched a couple of wire holders / groove clamps show up on thingiverse, but they all only handle certain sizes of wire. This can accommodate anything from 1mm to 20mm in diameter.</p>

<p>This is designed for M3 bolts &amp; nuts:</p>

<ul>
<li>x2 10mm</li>
<li>x1 50mm</li>
<li>x6 non-locking nut</li>
<li>x3 matching washers</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1460370">Flexing Battery Holders - Customizable</a></h2>

<p><img src="MP49_FlexingBatteryHoldersCustomiza.jpg" alt="MP49_FlexingBatteryHoldersCustomiza" /></p>

<p>This is a minor fork of Enif's Flexing Battery Holder. It will produce a battery holder with an arbitrary number of cells in parallel and series.</p>

<p>Thanks to Infinigrove for sorting out alternating symbols.
Find the latest version of this at GitHub: https://github.com/txoof/flexbatt</p>

<p>Either choose your battery size and number of cells through the customizer, or use this as an includable library in another project or directly from the .scad file.</p>

<p>Wires can be passed through the ports in either end and wrapped around the small bars at either end of the battery holder. Route them and add a bit of solder for a solid joint. The built-in spring will help secure the battery.</p>

<p>It is possible to load the batteries in with either the negative or positive terminals toward the "spring". Wire your holder accordingly.</p>

<p><img src="PM49_BossAlarm.jpg" alt="PM49_BossAlarm" /></p>

<p><em>"Its a common occurrence in any office  youre on Facebook or browsing SparkFun when all of a sudden your boss walks in to see that youre not working. This project aims to avoid that embarrassment and frowns from management. The Boss Alarm alerts you of anyone walking into your office and automatically changes the active program on your computer. The sensors are inconspicuously hidden in cute woodland creatures that are guaranteed to brighten up your office and definitely not creep out any of your coworkers!"</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://robertgawron.blogspot.pt/2015/06/poor-mans-lab-generator.html">Tiny and cheap lab generator</a></p>

<p><img src="PM49_TinyAndCheapLabGenerator.jpg" alt="PM49_TinyAndCheapLabGenerator" /></p>

<p><em>"Function generator is a rely useful tool in the lab, a simple version can be build at home, there's a lot of examples on the Internet, some are much more complex and powerful, but this one is intended to be really simple and cheap. It can be also built-in in some bigger projects that also requires a generator. The generator can output (only) square signal with adjusted frequency and pulse width. The amplitude may be also modified by soldering different values on the voltage divider on the output, it's a bit laborious, but if it will be used in digital or microprocessor projects, then there isn't really need for amplitude adjustment."</em></p></li>

I decided to make it myself as very few parts are needed and costs nothing compared to the fee from Event manager"</em></p></li>
