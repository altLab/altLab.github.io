<p>Esta semana o Raspberry Pi fez 4 anos. Com mais de oito milhões de placas vendidas foi apresentada a terceira versão da placa. Esta vem com um CPU ARM Cortex-A53 de 64-bit a 1.2GHz (sensivelmente 10x o desempenho do Raspberry Pi 1), interface Wireless 802.11n e Bluetooth 4.1. A fabricante de pneus Goodyear apresentou um novo protótipo de pneu esférico designado Eagle-360 que altera a forma tradicional como conhecemos os pneus e poderá ser um dos aspectos inovadores na nova geração de carros sem condutor. Ficámos também a conhecer a forma como os robots estão a ajudar as cirurgias tanto pelo facto de serem mais precisos como poderem ir a locais onde as mãos humanas têm dificuldade.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker e na rubrica "Documentação" apresentamos quatro livros (eBooks) que podem ser descarregados livremente e que esta semana são sobre Conceitos de bases de dados <em>Oracle</em>, algoritmos em teoria de jogos, a teoria e a técnica associadas à musica electrónica, um livro sobre a forma como o "Public Domain" está a moldar a nossa sociedade e um livro sobre o Sonic Pi. Falamos igualmente da revista MagPI 43 e sobre a newelectronics de 23 de fevereiro.</p>

<p><em>"Exactly four years ago, on 29 February 2012, we unleashed the original 256MB Raspberry Pi Model B on a largely unsuspecting world. Since then, we’ve shipped over eight million units, including three million units of Raspberry Pi 2, making us the UK’s all-time best-selling computer. The Raspberry Pi Foundation has grown from a handful of volunteers to have over sixty full-time employees, including our new friends from Code Club. We’ve sent a Raspberry Pi to the International Space Station and are training teachers around the world through our Picademy program. In celebration of our fourth birthday, we thought it would be fun to release something new. Accordingly, Raspberry Pi 3 is now on sale for $35 (the same price as the existing Raspberry Pi 2), featuring: A 1.2GHz 64-bit quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 CPU (~10x the performance of Raspberry Pi 1); Integrated 802.11n wireless LAN and Bluetooth 4.1; Complete compatibility with Raspberry Pi 1 and 2"</em></p></li>

<p><img src="NS44_GoodyearRevealsConceptTiresFor.jpg" alt="NS44_GoodyearRevealsConceptTiresFor" /></p>

<p><em>"The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company has revealed two innovative new concept tires at the 86th Geneva International Motor Show that could literally reshape the future for autonomous cars. The concepts: the spherical-shaped Eagle-360 - a future-oriented tire - was designed with key features of maneuverability, connectivity and biomimicry for autonomous mobility, while the IntelliGrip, featuring advanced sensor and treadwear technology, is a solution for the earlier adoption of self-driving vehicles. Both tires are designed with safety in mind, which according to recent studies, is a key concern among consumers around autonomous vehicles. They reflect Goodyear’s focus on anticipating the rapidly evolving needs of its customers."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"Dr. Umamaheswar Duvvuri has used a snake-like robot to perform more than a half dozen throat surgeries over the past month. Simply put, the robot is more accurate than Duvvuri could hope to be. The Flex Robotic System is so easy to use, Duvvuri said even medical students can learn to use it with proficiency within three tries. Duvvuri, director of head and neck surgery at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), said the Flex Robotic System surgical robot he's been using has sub-millimeter accuracy; it can "snake" its way to any place in the body and it causes less damage to soft tissue."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"New research led by scientists from the Department of Energy’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and Stanford University shows how individual atoms move in trillionths of a second to form wrinkles on a three-atom-thick material. Revealed by a brand new “electron camera,” one of the world’s speediest, this unprecedented level of detail could guide researchers in the development of efficient solar cells, fast and flexible electronics and high-performance chemical catalysts. The breakthrough, accepted for publication Aug. 31 in Nano Letters, could take materials science to a whole new level. It was made possible with SLAC’s instrument for ultrafast electron diffraction (UED), which uses energetic electrons to take snapshots of atoms and molecules on timescales as fast as 100 quadrillionths of a second."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"Nature has had billions of years to perfect photosynthesis, which directly or indirectly supports virtually all life on Earth. In that time, the process has achieved almost 100 percent efficiency in transporting the energy of sunlight from receptors to reaction centers where it can be harnessed — a performance vastly better than even the best solar cells. One way plants achieve this efficiency is by making use of the exotic effects of quantum mechanics — effects sometimes known as “quantum weirdness.” These effects, which include the ability of a particle to exist in more than one place at a time, have now been used by engineers at MIT to achieve a significant efficiency boost in a light-harvesting system."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"In the drive to miniaturize electronics, solenoids have become way too big, say Rice University scientists who discovered the essential component can be scaled down to nano-size with macro-scale performance. The secret is in a spiral form of atom-thin graphene that, remarkably, can be found in nature, according to Rice theoretical physicist Boris Yakobson and his colleagues. "</em></p></li>

But in addition, it also allows to design unprecedented, innovative lighting solutions. Imec and CMST’s new thermoplastically deformable electronic circuits now add a new dimension to the possibilities to fabricate novel lamp designs as well as smart applications in ambient intelligence and wearables."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"This manual provides an architectural and conceptual overview of the Oracle database server, which is an object-relational database management system. It describes how the Oracle database server functions, and it lays a conceptual foundation for much of the practical information contained in other manuals. Information in this manual applies to the Oracle database server running on all operating systems."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.cambridge.org/journals/nisan/downloads/Nisan_Non-printable.pdf">Algorithmic Game Theory</a></p>

<p><em>"Over the last few years, there has been explosive growth in the research done at the interface of computer science, game theory, and economic theory, largely motivated by the emergence of the Internet. Algorithmic Game Theory develops the central ideas and results of this new and exciting area. More than 40 of the top researchers in this field have written chapters whose topics range from the foundations to the state of the art. This book contains an extensive treatment of algorithms for equilibria in games and markets, computational auctions and mechanism design, and the 'price of anarchy,' as well as applications in networks, peer-to-peer systems, security, information markets, and more."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://msp.ucsd.edu/techniques/latest/book.pdf">The Theory and Technique of Electronic Music</a></p>

<p><em>"This is the first book to develop both the theory and the practice of synthesizing musical sounds using computers. Each chapter starts with a theoretical description of one technique or problem area and ends with a series of working examples (over 100 in all), covering a wide range of applications. A unifying approach is taken throughout; chapter two, for example, treats both sampling and wavetable synthesis as special cases of one underlying technique. Although the theory is presented quantitatively, the mathematics used goes no further than trigonometry and complex numbers. The examples and supported software — along with a machine-readable version of the text — are available on the web and maintained by a large online community."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://thepublicdomain.org/thepublicdomain1.pdf">The Public Domain - Enclosing the Commons of the Mind</a></p>

<p><em>"Our music, our culture, our science and our economic welfare all depend on a delicate balance between those ideas that are controlled and those that are free, between intellectual property and the public domain. In The Public Domain: Enclosing the Commons of the Mind (Yale University Press) James Boyle introduces readers to the idea of the public domain and describes how it is being tragically eroded by our current copyright, patent, and trademark laws. In a series of fascinating case studies, Boyle explains why gene sequences, basic business ideas and pairs of musical notes are now owned, why jazz might be illegal if it were invented today, why most of 20th century culture is legally unavailable to us, and why today's policies would probably have smothered the World Wide Web at its inception."</em></p></li>

<h1 id="Modelos-3D">Modelos 3D <a href="#topo">^</a></h1>

<p>Com a disponibilidade de ferramentas que permitem dar azo a nossa imaginação na criação de peças 3D e espaços como o <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/">thingiverse</a> para as publicar, esta rubrica apresenta alguns modelos selecionados que poderão ser úteis.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:82620">Buckle Box, Printable In One Piece</a></h2>

<p><img src="MP44_BuckleBoxPrintableInOnePiece.jpg" alt="MP44_BuckleBoxPrintableInOnePiece" /></p>

<p>This is my second try at a one piece hinged box with latch. This latch is a little easier to operate than my box design I derived it from. For more information about this box, see the box it was derived from.</p>

<p>I like this latch design a lot. It locks the box closed very nicely and this version I printed as a test, has very nice tolerance at the hinge and at the latch. Now that the testing is over, I can design my real project.</p>

<p>UPDATE: v2 files now how a more tolerant latch. I realized that the tolerance for the latch was mistakenly coded to be half the tolerance of the hinge, since the hinge has slop tolerance for both the mail and female side. The latch should break free much easier on this version. Thanks everyone who printed it out or at least tried.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1367661">Customizable U-Hook</a></h2>

<p><img src="MP44_CustomizableUHook.jpg" alt="MP44_CustomizableUHook" /></p>

<p>Parametric hook, universal and very strong.</p>

<p>I’ve been looking a while for a parametric hook modeling, but I didn’t found any available model that ideally combines strength and customizing possibilities. So I tried to create the model I wanted. This is an attempt for a universal and very strong parametric hook, easily 3D printable ﻿as a "finished product".</p>

<p>I did a "stress test" with my parametric U-Hook in its default configuration. The hook had been printed in PLA, with 2 perimeters, 0.2 mm layer height, and 20% infill.
It supported a weight of 47,4 Kg.</p>

<p>Full documentation available as a PDF (in English and French) in the ﻿"Thing Files" section, or on my website :
http://www.sergepayen.fr/en/parametric-u-hook</p>

<p>I also wrote a little tutorial about "how to use a parametric file" with OpenScad software, that could help you if you're not familiar with this type of file :

<p><img src="MP44_CustumizableSolderlessWireTerm.jpg" alt="MP44_CustumizableSolderlessWireTerm" /></p>

<p>Customizable design of my solderless wire termination with pin headers (thing: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1380452).
Notice when opening Customizer: the first image is a bug (and I don't know why), but as soon as you change a setting or view, it does a refresh and works fine.</p>

<p>It's possible to adjust number of rows (1 or 2) and desired number of pins and distance between pin rows...</p>

<p>This is my first OpenSCAD file, learned to use it in 30 min, so it's very basic ;)</p>

<p>Also added the SolidWorks part.
Comments appreciated :)</p>

Because my multi-meter does not have a capacitance measurement, I decided to make one! The principle of measuring capacitance is quite simple. The voltage of a capacitor charging through a resistor increases with time T. The time it takes to reach a certain voltage, is related to the values of the resistor and capacitor. In this project, we'll use a 555 timer circuit as a monostable multivibrator. If that sounds like some dark magic to you, don't worry, it's quite straightforward. I'll refer to the the Wikipedia page for the details, as we'll focus on the things we really need: the schematic and formula. The time in which the capacitor C charges through the resistor R is given by: T = ln(3) x R x C = 1.1 RC.

The Nucleo boards maintain the Arduino footprint but also have headers for the extra pins which gives this board plenty of GPIO for your projects.  In turn, you end up with multiple buses such as SPI, I2C, and UARTs for your consumption. They are priced very well and come in different flavors based on your needs. Each flavor is based on different ARM Cortex architectures such as M0, M3, and M4. One of the best features is real debugging via ST-Link/V2-1. The unfortunate thing due to the nature of mbed, you can only use the debugging features using a full desktop IDE such as Keil or some of the other free alternatives.

Use fixed-point representation instead. An FPU is an hardware block specially designed to carry on arithmetic operations on floating point numbers. Even though the C/C++ code may work without an FPU, its always much faster to use hardware designed for a specific purpose, like this one, instead of relying on a software implementation, something that the compiler will do for you, knowing the hardware restrictions you have but not in an efficient manner. Essentially, it will generate a lot of assembly code, greatly increasing the size of your program and the amount of time required to complete the operation. Thus, if you dont have an FPU available and you still want to perform those arithmetic operations efficiently youll have to convert those numbers to fixed-point representation. Integers! But how? By scaling them. Lets see how that scaling value may be determined."</em></p></li>

Since I have no clock at my work bench I decided to construct one from some prototyping pad board, a Microchip PIC18F26K20 microcontroller and a Dallas DS32KHZ temperature compensated 32.768kHz crystal."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"This instructable is about a universal short circuit protection that I've designed to use in bench power supplies. I've designed it to fit in most power supplies circuits. In order to this circuit fit in your bench power supply, you will need to do some calculations, but don't worry, I'll explain everything on the next steps."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"Project: Create a graphic servo tester that lets you test your servos. I had some servos that I needed to test. I had to see if they worked, and needed to see what the limits were for clockwise and counterclockwise operation. I needed to center the servo when fed with a 1500 microsecond pulse. I used a CGMICROMITE as the brains and an LCD for the display. Buttons, voltage regulator, a few passives, and connectors are the only additional components mounted on the PCB."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"The sound card runs at a sample rate of 48KHz, 32KHz or 24KHz selectable by the OS with 12 bits per sample. The quality approaches commercial grade as the sample rate is higher then CDs. 44.1KHz was not implemented due to the difficultly and additional processing overhead. The sample rates that were implemented are all a multiple of the 1ms USB frame meaning each frame sends the same amount of data. 44.1KHz requires the card to handle different amounts of data each frame requiring more advanced buffering and synchronization techniques and more processing power. Microsoft Windows automatically resamples the 44.1KHz audio found on CDs to 48KHz."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"Hi all! After a couple of months with a lot of work, I come here again with the last board I develop before Christmas. Its a dual USB serial and I2C converter based on two MCP2221 Microchip 2.0 USB-Serial bridges. I develop it as a need on my work with the last project Im involved. I need to monitor a serial communication between two devices. With only one converter, I must choose between RX and TX lines to monitoring the traffic. With this solution, I can listen at the same time TX and RX lines, so the monitoring is more easy. And with a software like Docklight (you can download a free evaluation copy here), you can choose the monitoring option to display both channels. After the break you can find all the technical info of the board!"</em></p></li>

<p><em>"This project will help you to expose correctly your cyanotypes under the sun light. Because its UV component is variable in time, and depends of many factors, this tool monitor the accumulated UV dose by measuring every second the actual intensity. Once you calibrate this tool, you will can reproduce the results independently if is a sunny, cloudy or rainy day. The principle upon this works is what in mathematics is know as Numerical Integrator . In a simple case, let's assume a certain UV value which is constant (I), and takes some time (t) to properly expose our cyanotype. Now, if we double the UV intensity (I * 2), the time to have the same correct expose will be the half than before (t / 2)."</em></p></li>
