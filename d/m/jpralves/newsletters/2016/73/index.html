<p>Faz hoje 225 que nasceu o físico <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday">Michael Faraday</a>. Este brilhante cientista Inglês contribuiu para avanços muito significativos nas áreas do electromagnetismo e da electroquímica. As suas principais descobertas incluem os princípios subjacentes à indução electromagnética, ao dia-magnetismo e à electrólise. Ficou imortalizado pela unidade <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farad">Farad</a>, que representa a capacitância eléctrica - capacidade de um corpo armazenar carga eléctrica.
Esta semana ficámos a saber que a primeira estação espacial chinesa - Tiangong-1 - está fora de controlo e irá despenhar-se na terra algures em 2017. Esta estação tem 8.5 toneladas de peso e foi lançada em 2011. A Apple lançou a nova versão do seu sistema operativo MacOS Sierra duas semanas depois do lançamento do seu ultimo iPhone. A ARM lançou esta semana o seu ARM Cortex-R52. Trata-se de um processador real-time com funcionalidades de segurança avançadas para veículos autónomos e robôs médicos e industriais. A STMicroelectronics já anunciou que irá licenciar esta versão do processador. Foi lançada uma nova versão do Arduino IDE - 1.6.12 - que suporta o novo sistema operativo da Apple e que inclui uma integração experimental com o Arduino Cloud API.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como alguns modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis.</p>

<p><em>"Chinas first space station is expected to come crashing down to Earth next year, fuelling concerns that Chinese space authorities have lost control of the 8.5-tonne module. The Tiangong-1 or Heavenly Palace lab was described as a potent political symbol of Chinas growing power when it was launched in 2011 as part of an ambitious scientific push to turn China into a space superpower. However, speaking at a satellite launch centre in the Gobi Desert last week officials said the unmanned module had now comprehensively fulfilled its historical mission and was set to re-enter the earths atmosphere at some point in the second half of 2017."</em> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/21/chinas-tiangong-1-space-station-out-of-control-crash-to-earth">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Better batteries that charge quickly and last a long time are a brass ring for engineers. But despite decades of research and innovation, a fundamental understanding of exactly how batteries work at the smallest of scales has remained elusive. In a paper published this week in the journal Science, a team led by William Chueh, an assistant professor of materials science and engineering at Stanford and a faculty scientist at the Department of Energys SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, has devised a way to peer as never before into the electrochemical reaction that fuels the most common rechargeable cell in use today: the lithium-ion battery."</em> <a href="http://news.stanford.edu/2016/08/04/stanford-probes-secrets-rechargeable-batteries/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"MIT engineers have developed a microfluidic device that replicates the neuromuscular junction  the vital connection where nerve meets muscle. The device, about the size of a U.S. quarter, contains a single muscle strip and a small set of motor neurons. Researchers can influence and observe the interactions between the two, within a realistic, three-dimensional matrix. The researchers genetically modified the neurons in the device to respond to light. By shining light directly on the neurons, they can precisely stimulate these cells, which in turn send signals to excite the muscle fiber. The researchers also measured the force the muscle exerts within the device as it twitches or contracts in response."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2016/replicating-connection-between-muscles-and-nerves-0803">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Researchers have built a miniature electro-optical switch which can change the spin  or angular momentum  of a liquid form of light by applying electric fields to a semiconductor device a millionth of a metre in size. Their results, reported in the journal Nature Materials, demonstrate how to bridge the gap between light and electricity, which could enable the development of ever faster and smaller electronics. There is a fundamental disparity between the way in which information is processed and transmitted by current technologies. To process information, electrical charges are moved around on semiconductor chips; and to transmit it, light flashes are sent down optical fibres. Current methods of converting between electrical and optical signals are both inefficient and slow, and researchers have been searching for ways to incorporate the two."</em> <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/liquid-light-switch-could-enable-more-powerful-electronics">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="http://duoskin.media.mit.edu/">DuoSkin - Rapidly prototyping on-skin user interfaces using skin-friendly materials</a></h2>

<p><em>"DuoSkin is a fabrication process that enables anyone to create customized functional devices that can be attached directly on their skin. Using gold metal leaf, a material that is cheap, skin-friendly, and robust for everyday wear, we demonstrate three types of on-skin interfaces: sensing touch input, displaying output, and wireless communication. DuoSkin draws from the aesthetics found in metallic jewelry-like temporary tattoos to create on-skin devices which resemble jewelry. DuoSkin devices enable users to control their mobile devices, display information, and store information on their skin while serving as a statement of personal style. We believe that in the future, on-skin electronics will no longer be black-boxed and mystified; instead, they will converge towards the user friendliness, extensibility, and aesthetics of body decorations, forming a DuoSkin integrated to the extent that it has seemingly disappeared."</em> <a href="http://duoskin.media.mit.edu/">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="http://news.mit.edu/2016/sponge-creates-steam-using-ambient-sunlight-0822">Sponge creates steam using ambient sunlight</a></h2>

<p><em>"How do you boil water? Eschewing the traditional kettle and flame, MIT engineers have invented a bubble-wrapped, sponge-like device that soaks up natural sunlight and heats water to boiling temperatures, generating steam through its pores. The design, which the researchers call a solar vapor generator, requires no expensive mirrors or lenses to concentrate the sunlight, but instead relies on a combination of relatively low-tech materials to capture ambient sunlight and concentrate it as heat. The heat is then directed toward the pores of the sponge, which draw water up and release it as steam. From their experiments  including one in which they simply placed the solar sponge on the roof of MITs Building 3  the researchers found the structure heated water to its boiling temperature of 100 degrees Celsius, even on relatively cool, overcast days. The sponge also converted 20 percent of the incoming sunlight to steam."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2016/sponge-creates-steam-using-ambient-sunlight-0822">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="http://naturalrobotics.group.shef.ac.uk/supp/2016-003/">Turing learning: a metric-free approach to inferring behavior and its application to swarms</a></h2>

<p><em>"We propose Turing Learning, a novel system identification method for inferring behavior. Turing Learning simultaneously optimizes models and classifiers. The classifiers are provided with data samples from both an agent and models under observation, and are rewarded for discriminating between them. Conversely, the models are rewarded for 'tricking' the classifiers into categorizing them as the agent. Unlike other methods for system identification, Turing Learning does not require predefined metrics to quantify the difference between the agent and models. We present two case studies with swarms of simulated robots that show that Turing Learning outperforms a metric-based system identification method in terms of model accuracy. It also produces a useful byproduct in the form of classifiers that can be used to detect abnormal behavior in the swarm. Moreover, we show that Turing Learning also successfully infers the behavior of physical robot swarms. The results show that collective behaviors can be directly inferred from motion trajectories of individual agents in the swarm, which may have significant implications for the study of animal collectives. Furthermore, Turing Learning could prove useful wherever a behavior is not easily characterizable using metrics, making it suitable for a wide range of applications."</em> <a href="http://naturalrobotics.group.shef.ac.uk/supp/2016-003/">[...]</a></p>

The original project used Bluetooth for display data transfer from a smartphone, but this one now uses Wifi. The display message is sent through web browser to a ESP8266 module that is configured as a web-server. No Arduino or any other microcontroller is used.

The BeagleBone Black is an inexpensive, credit-card sized computer that has two built-in microcontrollers called PRUs. By using the PRUs, you can implement real-time functionality that isn't possible in Linux. The PRU microcontrollers can be programmed in C using an IDE, which is much easier than low-level assembler programming. I recently wrote an article about the PRU microcontrollers, explaining how to program them in assembler and describing how they interact with the main ARM processor; so read it for more background."</em> <a href="http://www.righto.com/2016/09/how-to-run-c-programs-on-beaglebones.html">[...]</a></p>
