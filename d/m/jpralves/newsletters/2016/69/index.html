<p>Esta semana foi anunciada a descoberta de um planeta  designado de Proxima b, a orbitar a estrela mais próxima do Sol - Proxima Centauri -  com condições favoráveis para ter agua na sua superfície e como tal semelhante à Terra. Foi apresentada uma técnica inovadora para restaurar a fertilidade das mulheres que recorrer a impressão 3D para a criação de uma prótese de ovário para o desenvolvimento dos ovos saudáveis. O Linux faz hoje 25 anos e está de parabéns. Uma equipa do MIT desenvolveu uma rede de roteadores programáveis que se ajustam de forma programável às características do tráfego melhorando assim o seu desempenho. Por fim e para resolver o problema do crescimento exponencial de dispositivos conectados via redes sem Fio, o Laboratório de Ciência da Computação e Inteligência Artificial do MIT apresentou o MegaMIMO 2.0. Este sistema tem a capacidade de transferir informação três vezes mais rapidamente e duplicando o alcance do sinal.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. Na rubrica "Documentação" apresentamos a revista MagPI de Setembro.</p>

<p><em>"A pale red dot not far from our sun may be orbited by a pale blue dot much different than Earth. In a shocking find, astronomers Wednesday announced their discovery of an Earth-sized planet orbiting the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, just 4.2 light-years away. This warm world, cataloged as Proxima b, sits smack in the middle of its habitable zone  the sweetest of sweet spots  where liquid surface water could exist. But Proxima Centauri is not like our sun. Its a cool, low-mass star known as a red dwarf. So the planet only qualifies as potentially habitable because it circles its sun in an orbit tighter than Mercurys."</em> <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2016/08/24/earth-proxima-is-our-new-neighbor-most-promising-exoplanet-yet/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Weve become pretty good at treating certain types of cancerparticularly in kids. Eighty percent of children under 18 are now beating their various malignancies for at least the first five years, compared with less than 10 percent in the 1950s. But female survivors often face a common problem when they grow up: Their harsh cancer treatments have left their ovaries barren. So reproductive biologist Monica Laronda and biomedical engineer Alexandra Rutz of Northwestern University set out to build them new ones. They designed a 3D-printed prosthetic ovary that can grow healthy eggs. Their secret is scaffolding, which is made of 3D-printed gelatin, and holds ovarian follicles that secrete hormones and contain the structures that develop into eggs."</em> <a href="http://www.popsci.com/restoring-fertility-with-3d-printers">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"When Linus Torvalds first announced his new operating system, Linux, on Aug. 25, 1991, it was a "completely personal project, Torvalds said at LinuxCon today. The kernel totaled 10,000 lines of code that would only run on the same type of hard disk Torvalds himself used because the geometry of the hard disk was hard-coded into the source code. And, he expected only other students to be interested in studying it as a theory. Those early days were his most memorable, he said, when he was working to solve tough problems and create something out of nothing."</em> <a href="https://www.linux.com/news/linus-torvalds-reflects-25-years-linux">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"New design should enable much more flexible traffic management, without sacrificing speed. Like all data networks, the networks that connect servers in giant server farms, or servers and workstations in large organizations, are prone to congestion. When network traffic is heavy, packets of data can get backed up at network routers or dropped altogether. Also like all data networks, big private networks have control algorithms for managing network traffic during periods of congestion. But because the routers that direct traffic in a server farm need to be superfast, the control algorithms are hardwired into the routers circuitry. That means that if someone develops a better algorithm, network operators have to wait for a new generation of hardware before they can take advantage of it."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2016/programmable-network-routers-0823">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"MegaMIMO system from the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab speeds data transfer by coordinating multiple routers at the same time. There are few things more frustrating than trying to use your phone on a crowded network. With phone usage growing faster than wireless spectrum, were all now fighting over smaller and smaller bits of bandwidth. Spectrum crunch is such a big problem that the White House is getting involved, recently announcing both a $400 million research initiative and a $4 million global competition devoted to the issue. But researchers from MITs Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL) say that they have a possible solution. In a new paper, a team led by professor Dina Katabi demonstrate a system called MegaMIMO 2.0 that can transfer wireless data more than three times faster than existing systems while also doubling the range of the signal."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2016/solving-network-congestion-megamimo-0823">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"A team of Harvard University researchers with expertise in 3-D printing, mechanical engineering, and microfluidics has demonstrated the first autonomous, untethered, entirely soft robot. This small, 3-D-printed robot  nicknamed the octobot  could pave the way for a new generation of such machines. Soft robotics could help revolutionize how humans interact with machines. But researchers have struggled to build entirely compliant robots. Electric power and control systems  such as batteries and circuit boards  are rigid, and until now soft-bodied robots have been either tethered to an off-board system or rigged with hard components."</em> <a href="http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/08/the-first-autonomous-entirely-soft-robot/">[...]</a></p>

First it will ask to pour water on plant. Then it will learn what is a good moisture for a plant and after that it will start to monitor your plant's moisture levels. But it will not waste energy by speaking when nobody is around, instead it will speak only if someone is going by it. It detects if someone is in a near proximity by it's infrared motion sensing eye. Finally it uses rechargeable battery that you can charge via micro usb cable. It will also tell you when it needs to be charged and when it has full battery.

Whats new &amp; different: the Entropy library measures the jitter between the ATmega328 watchdog timers RC oscillator and the ceramic resonator (on Pro Mini boards) driving the CPU. It cranks out four bytes of uncorrelated bits every half-second, which isnt quite fast enough for a sparkly display, but re-seeding the Arduino PRNG whenever enough entropy arrives works well enough. One could, of course, re-seed the PRNG with Geiger bits or junction noise to the same effect. The key advantage of the Entropy library: no external hardware required. The downside: no external hardware required, so, minus those techie transistors / resistors / op amps, it will look like Just Another Arduino Project."</em> <a href="https://softsolder.com/2016/08/25/random-led-dots-entropy-library-for-moah-speed-with-less-gimcrackery/">[...]</a></p>
