<h1>Editorial</h1>

<p>Esta é a Newsletter Nº 87 que se apresenta com o mesmo formato que as anteriores. Se gostar da Newsletter partilhe-a!</p>

<p>Todas as Newsletters encontram-se indexadas no <a href="../../index.html">link</a>.</p>

<p>Esta Newsletter tem os seguintes tópicos:</p>

</ul>

<p>Esta é a última newsletter de 2016. Pelas newsletters deste ano passaram cerca de 2000 projectos de maker, 170 modelos 3D muitos deles paramétricos, cerca de 220 livros e revistas de distribuição livre, 600 notícias e artigos sobre ciência e tecnologia, trouxemos a informação que entendemos ser pertinente para a audiência desta newsletter que se traduz num índice do que melhor a Internet nos dá.</p>

<p>Hoje comemora-se o nascimento de <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Goodyear">Charles Goodyear</a>. Este químico autodidacta, nasceu em Connecticut nos Estados Unidos, e ficou conhecido por ter inventado o processo de vulcanização da borracha. A descoberta foi acidental depois de cinco anos de tentativas falhadas a tentar tornar a borracha mais resistente. Comemora-se também o nascimento de <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Parkes">Alexander Parkes</a>. É atribuído a este inventor Inglês a primeira forma de plástico feita pelo homem - a Parkesina. Por fim, comemora-se também o nascimento no dia de hoje de <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Joannes_Stieltjes">Thomas Joannes Stieltjes</a>. Este matemático Holandês nascido em Zwolle, ficou conhecido pela integral de  Riemann–Stieltjes.</p>

<p>Nesta semana ficámos a saber que o ano de 2016 irá ter mais um segundo. Devido à Terra estar a abrandar terá que ser feito este acerto. É um fenómeno que iremos observar a cada 18 meses. A precisão dos relógios atómicos que se encontram nos diversos dispositivos , alguns deles em órbita, associada com o atraso da Terra obriga a estes acertos.
Ficámos também a saber que diversas companhias mineiras estão a utilizar robôs para recolher o minério e para o transportar reduzindo a mão de-obra humana.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como alguns modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis. São apresentados também 6 livros sobre os temas de introdução à programação assembly em processadores MIPS, introdução aos sistemas embebidos, a engenharia de sistemas embebidos confiáveis, inovação aberta, Desenho, modelagem e simulação de sistemas usando Ptolomeu II e por fim Estrutura e Interpretação de Sinais e Sistemas.</p>

<p>Sendo a última newsletter do ano não posso deixar de expressar os meus votos de um excelente 2017 para todos.</p>

<p><em>"Because Earth is slowing down, we will synchronize our clocks by adding a leap second just before we enter 2017. Just before midnight on New Year's Eve 2016 UTC time, a leap second will be added to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which is the world's main time standard. Leap seconds are added either at the end of June or December approximately every 18 months in order to synchronize clocks worldwide with the Earth's slowing rotation."</em> <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/leap-second-add-december-2016.html">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Mining companies are rolling out autonomous trucks, drills, and trains, which will boost efficiency but also reduce the need for human employees. Each of these trucks is the size of a small two-story house. None has a driver or anyone else on board. Mining company Rio Tinto has 73 of these titans hauling iron ore 24 hours a day at four mines in Australia’s Mars-red northwest corner. At this one, known as West Angelas, the vehicles work alongside robotic rock drilling rigs. The company is also upgrading the locomotives that haul ore hundreds of miles to port—the upgrades will allow the trains to drive themselves, and be loaded and unloaded automatically. Rio Tinto intends its automated operations in Australia to preview a more efficient future for all of its mines—one that will also reduce the need for human miners. The rising capabilities and falling costs of robotics technology are allowing mining and oil companies to reimagine the dirty, dangerous business of getting resources out of the ground."</em> <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603170/mining-24-hours-a-day-with-robots/">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/news/robotic-diver-expands-underwater-research">Deep sea coral reefs more accessible with touch-sensitive underwater robotic platform</a></h2>

<p><em>"Current underwater exploration and monitoring of oceanic resources is both expensive and challenging. It requires human divers who can only explore underwater environments during short periods of time and who can only safely go down to certain depths. Underwater vehicles have proven to be useful for exploring oceans at greater depths, but they lack human dexterity, which is necessary for performing fine manipulation tasks such as collecting samples and in situ experimentation. These underwater vehicles are also large and cumbersome, and their mechanical characteristics make them difficult to operate in closely confined fragile spaces or in turbulent fluid environments. To solve this issue, KAUST and Stanford University together with Meka Robotics have been collaborating for the past three years on an ambitious project. The goal of the project, called Red Sea Robotics Exploratorium, is to design and build a radical new underwater robotic platform to serve as a robotic avatar diver. The research project at KAUST is conducted between the University's Computer, Electrical and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering (CMSE) division, the Red Sea Research Center in the Biological and Environmental Science and Engineering (BESE) division, and the Artificial Intelligence lab team at Stanford University. The KAUST team includes Professors Khlaed Salama, Xabier Irigoyen, and Christian R. Voolstra. Stanford's team is led by Professors Oussama Khatib and Mark R Cutkosky and is under an AEA3 Collaborative Research Grant."</em> <a href="https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/news/robotic-diver-expands-underwater-research">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags have become almost ubiquitous – look carefully, and you’ll notice them in passports, credit cards, library books, office access passes, and even pet cats. The technology, which allows fast, automated identification of physical objects, is also a staple for many industries – factories and warehouses use it to track inventory and manage supply chains, pharmaceutical companies deploy it to track drugs, and courier services use it to tag deliveries. But what would happen if RFID technology were compromised?"</em> <a href="http://research.smu.edu.sg/news/smuresearch/2016/12/20/hack-proofing-our-devices">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="http://cupola.gettysburg.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&amp;context=oer">Introduction To MIPS Assembly Language Programming</a></h2>

<p><em>"This book was written to introduce students to assembly language programming in MIPS. As with all assembly language programming texts, it covers basic operators and instructions, subprogram calling, loading and storing memory, program control, and the conversion of the assembly language program into machine code. However this book was not written simply as a book on assembly language programming. The larger purpose of this text is to show how concepts in Higher Level Languages (HLL), such as Java or C/C++, are represented in assembly. By showing how program constructs from these HLL map into assembly, the concepts will be easier to understand and use when the programmer implements programs in languages like Java or C/C++. Concepts such as references and variables, registers, binary and Boolean operations, subprogram execution, memory types (heap, stack, and static), and array processing are covered to clarify the decisions made when implementing HLL. Program control is presented using a mapping from structured programs in pseudo code to help students understand structured programming, and why it exists. Memory access in assembly is presented to high light the difference between references (pointers) and values, and how these impact HLL."</em> <a href="http://cupola.gettysburg.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&amp;context=oer">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"In this book I integrate new theory and new research findings into the framework of a “free innovation paradigm.” Free innovation involves innovations developed and given away by consumers as a “free good,” with resulting improvements in social welfare. I explain that free innovation is an inherently simple, transaction-free, grassroots innovation process engaged in by tens of millions of people in the household sector of national economies. Unlike producer innovation, free innovation does not require intellectual property rights to function. Indeed, from the perspective of participants, free innovation is fundamentally not about money – it is about human flourishing. I spell out the economics of free innovation relative to producer innovation, and its major economic impacts. These are currently not measured and so hidden from view. I also develop and explore major implications of free innovation for innovation theory, policymaking, and practice."</em> <a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=867004085082100121105100109068067126125005064079075023078068068018009082011096118104118012027123051028125126125087095107019084053002058023017121122118099001010059087087020085117084127088024124124067011012066077075016013101065103095031080110113074&amp;EXT=pdf">[...]</a></p>

With the default settings and 0.2mm print resolution I was able to separate the individual coils by hand, though it is faster and easier with a knife or a spatula. When setting the separator thickness to 0 the profile becomes a rectangle again. This is useful for example for polygons or other shapes that can be more easily printed lying on the side. Supports should only be enabled from the platform, between coils it is not necessary. Small parts may produce self-intersecting surfaces, this may cause problems with some slicers.

<p><em>"Here’s a rewarding weekend project that turns an ordinary shop vacuum into a capable mini dust collector. It creates a swirling vortex of airflow to spin out all the big chips and sawdust particles, so that only the finest of fines will exit the top to be captured by your vacuum. Plus it’s see-through, so your friends will love watching the cyclonic action, and you’ll get to brag, “Yeah, I made that!” This is an easy-to-build dust separator with a baffle based on J. Phil Thien’s well-known “cyclone” design. It works because the incoming air is forced around the outside wall, where the heavier dust and chips fall through a slot in the baffle, into the large trash can below. When driven with a blower like I use, the baffle removes the need for a standalone dust collection system (which not everyone has the money, space, or power to accommodate). When used with a shop-vac, this simple dust collector will greatly prolong the life of your filters and prevent the constant need to empty the vacuum bin, which is typically small and difficult to remove."</em> <a href="http://makezine.com/projects/cyclone-dust-collector/?utm_source=MakeNewsletter+20161220">[...]</a></p>

This project communicates over Bluetooth so it can be played anywhere, regardless of a WiFi connection. The LCD displays important information such as points and the next instruction. The die rolls from a 1 - 3 and then the player piece moves accordingly. Once the piece gets all around the board, i.e. 30 spaces, or 180 degrees, the game ends. Points don't mean much right now, but this game could be expanded to include a reward for points earned. And don't worry! It is truly random, as the random seed is based off of voltage noise from the A0 pin. There are three servos on the board, and they only activate if there are enough players, i.e. if there are only two people playing, two servos will be active.

Of course you can always resort to software mods to achieve the same goal, but admittedly doing so in hardware is nevertheless more fun and as a bonus you also get an extra button. A video demonstrating this hack can be found towards the end. For a typical mouse, whenever a button is clicked the output voltage level from the button changes between high (e.g. Vcc) and low (e.g. Ground) and this voltage level is in turn translated into the clicks. So the idea behind this hack is simple, if we could connect a circuit in parallel to the mouse button and automatically change the output voltage level we would essentially achieve the same effect as physically clicking the button."</em> <a href="http://www.kerrywong.com/2016/12/24/hacking-your-mouse-for-rapid-firing/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Playing an instrument like the electric guitar requires a lot of time to practice and improve your playing skills. Certain styles of playing requires specifc effects. To achieve this guitarists use effect units which are commonly known as effects pedals.

These pedals come in various price ranges, but it does not oer the guitarist the possibility to create his own effects by reprogramming the effects pedal or using a custom effect. With the advancement in digital signal processors and the improvement in the field of music and electronics, it has become possible to create a multi-effects pedal capable of processing audio in real time. The primary aim of this project is to design and construct a multi-effects pedal that can be reprogrammed for the electric guitar. The multi-effects pedal and guitar should be able to be reprogrammed using a computer or function without any other external accessories when just practicing.

Hewlett-Packard had taken two years, 20 engineers, and a million dollars to design the HP-35, which used 5 complex chips and sold for $395. Sinclair's partnership with calculator manufacturer Bowmar had gone nowhere. Now Texas Instruments offered him an inexpensive calculator chip that could barely do four-function math. Could he use this chip to build a $100 scientific calculator? Texas Instruments' engineers said this was impossible - their chip only had 3 storage registers, no subroutine calls, and no storage for constants such as π. The ROM storage in the calculator held only 320 instructions, just enough for basic arithmetic. How could they possibly squeeze any scientific functions into this chip? Fortunately Clive Sinclair, head of Sinclair Radionics, had a secret weapon - programming whiz and math PhD Nigel Searle. In a few days in Texas, they came up with new algorithms and wrote the code for the world's first single-chip scientific calculator, somehow programming sine, cosine, tangent, arcsine, arccos, arctan, log, and exponentiation into the chip. The engineers at Texas Instruments were amazed. How did they do it? Up until now it's been a mystery. But through reverse engineering, I've determined the exact algorithms and implemented a simulator that runs the calculator's actual code.

A great invention of Nintendo is the Nunchuk, a cheap extension for the Wii U remote. As it uses I2C as transportation protocol, it's easy to access the raw data of the controller. As it is so easy, I thought there must be a standard solution for it, but couldn't find a stable implementation, but only loads of code snippets. That's why I focused on filling this gap and here it is. In this article, I'll guide you through the details and implement it for an Arduino."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/infusion/using-a-wii-nunchuk-with-arduino-597254">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"The concept for this Instructable is to create an IoT device that sends alerts when oil in an oil tank is low. This can be configured for industry, or in this case, to alert a homeowner of a low tank level through a text message and automatically create a work order for an oil delivery company to refill the tank. For hardware, we are going to use the NodeMCU device which is an ESP8266 on a development board, and the hall effect module from the Arduino TinkerKit. I will note that there are MANY ways you could choose to detect the height of the level gauge on the oil tank, so I would encourage experimentation with other sensors as well. Additionally, I chose to use IBM Bluemix to act as a MQTT broker and to host Node-RED. IBM Bluemix is a cloud platform which we will use to easily create a application to connect our IoT devices to other services. Using this we can facilitate communications to other services, such as Twilio and dweet.io, and send http REST requests to interact with external systems. In our case, we will be interacting with IBM Maximo. Maximo is an enterprise asset management system which is commonly used by service providers for work management. It supports REST which we will use to integrate between Bluemix and Maximo."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/IoT-Oil-Tank-Gauge-With-IBM-Bluemix-and-Maximo/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"After the publication of the Arduino VGAx library on GitHub done by Sandro Maffiodo aka Smaffer, I have reproduced and published on Instructable some of the most famous classical games. Recently I decided to put four of them together, in particular: Pong, Breakout, Bomber and a drawing toy inspired to Etch-a-Sketch. The hardware is simply the same of my first Instructables: VGA Pong with Arduino Uno. The only needed components are two potentiometers, two buttons, few resistors and a DSUB15 (VGA) connector. As usual, no supporting IC or special shields!"</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-VGA-Games-4-in-1/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Learn how to combine a PICAXE, IR sensors, and a servo motor to create a device that responds to a moving stimulus. Spoilers: I hook it up to eyeballs that can follow a finger. PICAXEs are PIC microcontrollers that have been preloaded with a bootstrap code that allows programming in BASIC language. All About Circuits provides a series of articles that serve as a guide to choosing and using any of the chips in the PICAXE family. This article will provide an excellent starting point and will lead you to other articles in the series. This project consists of building a circuit using common IR (infrared) LEDs to produce IR emissions and an IR phototransistor to detect reflected IR light. The voltage from the phototransistors varies with the intensity of the IR light received. A specially programmed PICAXE microcontroller converts this analog voltage to a digital format and stores it for comparison with the output from other IR phototransistors. Based on the relative levels of the IR light, the PICAXE signals a servo motor to rotate to a predetermined position. Thus, reflected IR light can be used to control physical movements."</em> <a href="http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/projects/Controlling-a-Servo-with-a-PICAXE-and-an-IR-Sensor/">[...]</a></p>

The apparatus consists of flashing and rotating 8 LEDs at a frequency such that the human eye does not notice a discontinuity in the formation of the message. All characters that forms the message will be swept (column by column) and the angular rotation speed of the device, combined with the flashing speed of the LEDs will generate the image in the air as if it were for and complete message."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Propeller-Message-Display-POV/">[...]</a></p>
