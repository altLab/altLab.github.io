<h1>Projetos do altLab na Maker Faire Lisboa de 2016</h1>

<p><img src="AL60_GarraMakey.jpg" alt="AL60_GarraMakey" /></p>

<p>A Garra Makey é  um projeto de <em>hacking</em> tipo interface, do colectivo altLab, desenhado para expor os membros e a comunidade à comunicação entre micro-controladores usando diversos interfaces (i2c, serial, etc). O objectivo é espevitar a criatividade e levar as pessoas e os makers a repensar os interfaces de interacção com o mundo real pelo uso de micro-controladores. Trata-se de um sistema aberto que convida à criação de outros interfaces além dos que já foram feitos, como o controlo remoto, o joystick e o capacete <em>wireless</em>.</p>

<p><img src="AL60_altLapse.jpg" alt="AL60_AltLapse" /></p>

<p>O AltLapse é uma versão motorizada de um sistema de "Timelapse" baseada em Arduino e Raspberry PI. Dotado de um interface web, permite gerir o funcionamento do sistema de <em>timelapse</em>, acrescentando a capacidade de durante o mesmo podermos executar movimentos de <em>Pan</em> e <em>Tilt</em> da câmara. Impresso numa impressora 3D este sistema permite adaptar-se a qualquer tipo de câmara.</p>

<p><img src="AL60_HackyRacers.jpg" alt="AL60_HackyRacers" /></p>

<p>O HackyRacers é uma plataforma qu tem como objectivos ser uma componente lúdica que se expressa pela frase “Realizamos a virtualidade”, onde se pretende jogar duma forma diferente e com uma perspectiva out­of­the­box e ser uma plataforma educativa que terá dois vectores. O D.I.T. e o desafiar­te a ti próprio , onde podemos criar desafios e vencê­los, procurando e aprendendo. Vamos criar um contador de voltas? Qual o melhor
processo para o fazer? Magnético, Óptico, contacto? e ser uma plataforma pedagógica onde podemos demonstrar os efeitos da velocidade centrifuga ou qual a diferença entre o mundo simulado e o mundo real.</p>

<p><img src="AL60_detectorSonico.jpg" alt="AL60_detectorSonico" /></p>

<p>O detector de obstáculos para invisuais pretende ser uma ajuda na detecção de obstáculos acima da zona da cintura, permitindo ao invisual circular de forma mais segura, evitando o choque com objectos ao nível da cabeça e peito, zonas onde a bengala não é eficaz. Ao circular o utilizador recebe feedback através de vibração sempre que um obstáculo é detectado, sendo que essa vibração aumenta conforme a proximidade. Não se pretende substituir a bengala, antes complementar o seu uso através de um wearable.</p>

<p><img src="CT60_ParallelizingCommonAlgorithms.jpg" alt="CT60_ParallelizingCommonAlgorithms" /></p>

<p><em>"Every undergraduate computer-science major takes a course on data structures, which describes different ways of organizing data in a computer’s memory. Every data structure has its own advantages: Some are good for fast retrieval, some for efficient search, some for quick insertions and deletions, and so on. Today, hardware manufacturers are making computer chips faster by giving them more cores, or processing units. But while some data structures are well adapted to multicore computing, others are not. In principle, doubling the number of cores should double the efficiency of a computation. With algorithms that use a common data structure called a priority queue, that’s been true for up to about eight cores — but adding any more cores actually causes performance to plummet."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT60_3DPrintedPolymerTurnsMethaneTo.jpg" alt="CT60_3DPrintedPolymerTurnsMethaneTo" /></p>

<p><em>"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory scientists have combined biology and 3-D printing to create the first reactor that can continuously produce methanol from methane at room temperature and pressure. The team removed enzymes from methanotrophs, bacteria that eat methane, and mixed them with polymers that they printed or molded into innovative reactors. The research, which could lead to more efficient conversion of methane to energy production, appears in the June 15 edition of Nature Communications."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT60_ScientificGainsMayMakeElectron.jpg" alt="CT60_ScientificGainsMayMakeElectron" /></p>

<p><em>"Researchers at the Texas Analog Center of Excellence (TxACE) at UT Dallas are working to develop an affordable electronic nose that can be used in breath analysis for a wide range of health diagnosis. While devices that can conduct breath analysis using compound semiconductors exist, they are bulky and too costly for commercial use, said Dr. Kenneth O, one of the principal investigators of the effort and director of TxACE. The researchers determined that using CMOS integrated circuits technology will make the electronic nose more affordable. CMOS is the integrated circuits technology used to manufacture the bulk of electronics that have made smartphones, tablets and other devices possible. "</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT60_TurningCo2IntoRock.jpg" alt="CT60_TurningCo2IntoRock" /></p>

<p><em>"An international team of scientists have found a potentially viable way to remove anthropogenic (caused or influenced by humans) carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere – turn it into rock. The study, published today in Science, has shown for the first time that the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) can be permanently and rapidly locked away from the atmosphere, by injecting it into volcanic bedrock. The CO2 reacts with the surrounding rock, forming environmentally benign minerals. "</em></p></li>

<p><em>"Soft fluidic actuators consisting of elastomeric matrices with embedded flexible materials (e.g. cloth, paper, fiber, particles) are of particular interest to the robotics community because they are lightweight, affordable and easily customized to a given application. These actuators can be rapidly fabricated in a multi-step molding process and can achieve combinations of contraction, extension, bending and twisting with simple control inputs such as pressurized fluid. In our approach is to use new design concepts, fabrication approaches and soft materials to improve the performance of these actuators compared to existing designs. In particular, we use motivating applications (e.g. heart assist devices, soft robotic gloves) to define motion and force profile requirements. We can then embed mechanical intelligence into these soft actuators to achieve these performance requirements with simple control inputs."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT60_GoogleDeepmindAndFhiCollaborat.jpg" alt="CT60_GoogleDeepmindAndFhiCollaborat" /></p>

<p><em>"Oxford academics are teaming up with Google DeepMind to make artificial intelligence safer. Laurent Orseau, of Google DeepMind, and Stuart Armstrong, the Alexander Tamas Fellow in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford, will be presenting their research on reinforcement learning agent interruptibility at UAI 2016. The conference, one of the most prestigious in the field of machine learning, will be held in New York City from June 25-29. The paper which resulted from this collaborative research will be published in the Proceedings of the 32nd Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI). Orseau and Armstrong’s research explores a method to ensure that reinforcement learning agents can be repeatedly safely interrupted by human or automatic overseers. This ensures that the agents do not “learn” about these interruptions, and do not take steps to avoid or manipulate the interruptions. When there are control procedures during the training of the agent, we do not want the agent to learn about these procedures, as they will not exist once the agent is on its own. This is useful for agents that have a substantially different training and testing environment (for instance, when training a Martian rover on Earth, shutting it down, replacing it at its initial location and turning it on again when it goes out of bounds—something that may be impossible once alone unsupervised on Mars), for agents not known to be fully trustworthy (such as an automated delivery vehicle, that we do not want to learn to behave differently when watched), or simply for agents that need continual adjustments to their learnt behaviour. In all cases where it makes sense to include an emergency “off” mechanism, it also makes sense to ensure the agent doesn’t learn to plan around that mechanism."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"This manual will help you get your license, but getting your license is only the beginning. There is still much to learn, and to get the most out of amateur radio, you will have to continually learn new things. This study guide will teach you the answers to the test questions, but will not give you a deep understanding of electronics, radio, or the rules and regulations. That will be up to you after you get your license. I hope that by helping you get your license that you’ll be encouraged to become an active radio amateur and get on the air, participate in public service and emergency communications, join an amateur radio club, and experiment with radios, antennas, and circuits. These are the activities that will really help you learn about radio in depth, and in the end, help you be confident in your abilities as an amateur radio operator."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"The rotor of this electromechanical rotary encoder is composed of three resistors having 560, 1000 and 2200 Ohms soldered on a washer. One wiper makes steady contact with the washer, pulling the potential to ground while the second contact is connected to the +5V pin of an Arduino through a 1 kiloohms resistor. We get a reading of 5000mV, thus 5V whenever the switch is open. If the switch gets closed through the 560 Ohms resistor, a voltage divider composed of a 1 kiloohm and a 560 ohms resistor at 5V input voltage is formed. In theory we get a voltage drop of 1.79V across the 560 ohms resistor."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"I had an Arduino Nano fail due to over-voltage when I used a breadboard power supply to power my breadboard. The breadboard power supply used an AMS1117 linear regulator to reduce the 12V from the plug pack I was using, to provide the 5V needed by the Arduino and some other modules. The AMS1117 failed (presumably due to overheating) and let almost the full voltage from the power supply through to the Nano and other modules. Fortunately the other modules survived. However I decided that I needed some protection against this happening again. I tried a fuse and a 5.1V zener diode, which worked quite well but after accidentally blowing the fuse twice I realised that I needed a resettable circuit breaker, not a fuse. I looked on the internet for a suitable circuit breaker, but the lowest current rating I could find was 1.5 Amps, much too high for my requirements. So I decided to build something to do the job."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"The ability to understand and control LED matrices is an important skill for anyone who hopes to be well versed in electronics. The understanding of shift registers and row scanning techniques necessary for such feats will prove useful in countless other fields, and will allow you to do many other things past simple LED matrix manipulation. In need of such skills, I turned to internet searches to find a tutorial on how to do such things. While I found plenty of resources, I found that simply building a basic 8x8 led matrix and displaying some simple animations across it was somewhat useless; what would I ever use this for? I wanted to use my knowledge to build something useful, and so I immediately though of building a clock using an LED display and a real-time-clock (RTC). Then, wanting to distinguish my project from the thousands of other DIY clocks on the internet, I decided to add a sunrise alarm to it. For those of you who may be unaware, a sunrise alarm clock uses a light that gradually gets brighter to wake you up, emulating the sunrise in a way much more natural than a piercing alarm. At the time you set the alarm for, an LED array will gradually get brighter over the course of 15 minutes, and provided it is angled properly, you should be wide awake by the time it reaches its full brightness."</em></p></li>

Actually what got me started on this project was not the original pong, but the one I saw on Reddit. That it inspired me to make my own version. My goal is to make it as simple as possible so anyone can make it, learn from it, and hopefully even create their own variations. If you make one, please link to it in comments, I'd love to see your versions!"</em></p></li>

Well, now you can do so with your own custom made and designed intervalometer. Some DSLR's have an intervalometer inbuilt but they usually limit you to a few photograph per shooting session. Separate intervalometers are available online but they also have their own limitations like a limited function set.

<p><em>"We recently got hold of a "Crazy Cart", a seriously cool cart to race around with. As we only have one, I did want to have something to make the driving a bit more competitive, so I build an Arduino Based Lap Timer. The Lap timer uses an "Infrared light bridge" (Velleman PEM10D) to detect when something crosses the line. The nice thing about this light bridge is that it only needs on one side electronics. The other side just needs a passive reflector. If you do not want to buy this light brigde, you can use an laser bean on one side and a photodiode on the other side, but that will require "electronics" on both side."</em></p></li>
