<p>No dia de hoje comemora-se a data de nascimento de Enrico Fermi. Este físico italiano ficou conhecido por ter criado o primeiro reactor nuclear - o Chicago Pile-1. Ficou conhecido como o arquitecto da era nuclear e da bomba nuclear. Também hoje comemora-se a data de nascimento de László Bíró. Este inventor ficou conhecido pela invenção da caneta esferográfica em 1888.
Nas noticias desta semana a NVidia apresentou a sua plataforma Xavier - um super-computador com características de Inteligência Artificial para ser usado em veículos de condução autónoma. O processador tem capacidade de executar 20 TOPS (20 milhares de bilhão operações por segundo) consumindo apenas 20 watts de energia. O Elon Musk apresentou os seus planos para colocar o Homem em Marte. O plano ambicioso custará cerca de 500 mil dólares por pessoa com cerca de 100 pessoas por viagem. A viagem inicial está planeada para 2024. A Panasonic desenvolveu uma bateria de iões de lítio que é flexível e dobrável. Com uma espessura de cerca de 0.55mm é destinada para aplicações em dispositivos utilizáveis ou em formato de cartão. Estão a ser colocados os retoques finais no maior radio telescópio do mundo. Localizado na China trata-se de um equipamento com 500 metros de diâmetro. Tem mais 200 metros de diâmetro do conhecido radio Telescópio de Arecibo em Porto Rico. Desenvolvida pela fundação Raspberry Pi, a distribuição Raspbian passou a contar com um novo interface gráfico designado de PIXEL. Esta versão mais trabalhada do anterior interface pretende simplificar e melhorar o interface X desta distribuição dando-lhe algumas funcionalidades que vemos em distribuições ditas "main-stream" como o Ubuntu, o Mint ou o Fedora.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como alguns modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis.
Na rubrica “Documentação” apresentamos a revista MagPI de Outubro assim como a revista newselectronics de 27 de Setembro de 2016.</p>

<p>Está disponível por mais alguns dias um pacote de eBooks relacionados com a makerScene pro um custo bastante aceitável. Podem aproveitar a oportunidade no <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/books/make-fan-favs-and-digital-debuts">Humble Bumble</a>.</p>

<p><em>"At the inaugural GPU Technology Conference Europe, NVIDIA CEO Jen-Hsun Huang today unveiled Xavier, our all-new AI supercomputer, designed for use in self-driving cars. This is the greatest SoC endeavor I have ever known, and we have been building chips for a very long time, Huang said to the conferences 1,600 attendees. Xavier is a complete system-on-chip (SoC), integrating a new GPU architecture called Volta, a custom 8 core CPU architecture, and a new computer vision accelerator. The processor will deliver 20 TOPS (trillion operations per second) of performance, while consuming only 20 watts of power. As the brain of a self-driving car, Xavier is designed to be compliant with critical automotive standards, such as the ISO 26262 functional safety specification."</em> <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2016/09/28/xavier/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"In a talk on Tuesday at the International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk laid out engineering details to establish a permanent, self-sustaining civilization of a million people on Mars, with an initial flight as soon as 2024. SpaceX is designing a massive reusable Interplanetary Transport System spacecraft with cabins. The trip would initially cost $500,000 per person, with a long-term goal of 100 passengers per trip. Musk plans to make humanity a multiplanetary species to ensure survival in case of a calamity like an asteroid strike. This is really about minimizing existential risk and having a tremendous sense of adventure, he said."</em> <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/elon-musk-unveils-plans-for-mars-civilization">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Panasonic Corporation announced today that it has developed a Flexible Lithium-ion Battery with a thickness of only 0.55mm, or about 0.022 inches. Suitable for use in card-type and wearable devices, this rechargeable battery can retain its characteristics even after repeatedly bent into a radius of 25mm or twisted to an angle of 25 degrees. Card devices, which are often carried in wallets or pockets, require internal components that can withstand bending and twisting. Slim lithium-ion batteries are used in such devices, but these batteries can degrade when they are bent or twisted, resulting in shorter operating time for the devices. Panasonic's new flexible battery can withstand bending and twisting beyond the Japanese Industrial Standards for identification cards*1. When used in card devices such as smart cards and card keys that work on batteries, as well as body worn devices and smart clothing, this battery can retain its characteristics even if the device is frequently bent or twisted."</em> <a href="http://news.panasonic.com/global/press/data/2016/09/en160929-8/en160929-8.html">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"In a stunning landscape of jagged limestone hills in southwestern China, engineers are putting the finishing touches on a grand astronomy facility: a half-kilometer-wide dish nestled in a natural depression that will gather radio signals from the cosmos. The worlds largest radio telescope will catalog pulsars; probe gravitational waves, dark matter, and fast radio bursts; and listen for transmissions from alien civilizations. Yet the architect of the tour de force is blas about what his telescope might capture. Im really not very interested in science, Im sorry to say, says Nan Rendong, chief scientist and chief engineer of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) here. Colleagues insist he is joking, but there is no question that what has consumed 2 decades of his life and is now wowing other astronomersis engineering. As a civil engineering feat, FAST is obviously amazing, says Fred Lo, former director of the U.S. National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) in Charlottesville, Virginia."</em> <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/09/world-s-largest-radio-telescope-will-search-dark-matter-listen-aliens">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="https://news.ncsu.edu/2016/09/kia-mooreslaw/">Reconfigurable Chaos-based Microchips Offer Possible Solution to Moores Law</a></h2>

<p><em>"Researchers at North Carolina State University have developed new, nonlinear, chaos-based integrated circuits that enable computer chips to perform multiple functions with fewer transistors. These integrated circuits can be manufactured with off the shelf fabrication processes and could lead to novel computer architectures that do more with less circuitry and fewer transistors. Moores law states that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit will double every two years in order to keep up with processing demands. Previously this goal has been addressed by shrinking the size of individual transistors so that more could be added to the chip. However, that solution is quickly becoming untenable, and the semiconductor industry is looking for new ways to create better computer chips."</em> <a href="https://news.ncsu.edu/2016/09/kia-mooreslaw/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"ETH researchers are developing tiny, sophisticated technological and biological machines enabling non-invasive, selective therapies. Their creations include genetically modified cells that can be activated via brain waves, and swarms of microrobots that facilitate highly precise application of drugs. Richard Fleischner, who directed the 1966 cult film Fantastic Voyage, would have been delighted with Bradley Nelsons research: similar to the story in Fleischners film, Nelson wants to load tiny robots with drugs and manoeuvre them to the precise location in the human body where treatment is needed, for instance to the site of a cancer tumour. Alternatively, the tiny creatures could also be fitted with instruments, allowing operations to be performed without surgical intervention. The advantages compared with conventional treatments with drugs are clear: far more targeted therapy, and as a result, fewer side effects."</em> <a href="http://www.msrl.ethz.ch/news-and-events/msrl-news/2016/09/the-microdoctors-in-our-bodies---article-in-the-globe-magazine.html">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Archimedean spiral is the base of Spiral moving fish. The equation of Archimedean spiral is r = a + b * theta. If you just increase theta with the same amount, the distance between each segment of the moving fish would also be increased. In order to equally spaced each segment, I need to find out all angles between each segment. That's what the find_parent_angles module does in the .scad file. For more precisely controlling models between each segment, I also divide all parent angles found by the find_parent_angles module into several sub angles which may be controlled by the children_per_step parameter."</em> <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1782226">[...]</a></p>

The screw has a fair amount of space, so it should fit without problems into the frame screw hole. Should anyone still have an issue let me know and i can provide an additional version. The best way to mount the protector is to use the clamp itself by closing the clamp until the screw ball and protector ball joint clicks together or use your thumb. For my requirements i used only 25% (~3 hour print) because i need just to hold things in place while the glue is drying. For more force 100% infill is recommended and don't forget it's not made of steel. Enjoy :)"</em> <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1673030">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"This project describes a DIY wireless temperature and humidity monitor for kids or infants room using the Arduino platform, and inexpensive and easily available ASK transmitter/receiver modules. On the transmitting end, an Arduino nano senses the ambient room temperature and humidity using the DHT22 sensor and transmits the data to a receiving end Arduino over a 433 MHz ASK RF link. The receiving side Arduino decodes the received bytes and displays the information on a LCD screen. The indoor range of the RF transmission is about 100 ft, which is mostly sufficient for a decent size house."</em> <a href="http://www.electronics-lab.com/project/wireless-temperature-humidity-monitor-babys-room/">[...]</a></p>

It doesn't feel right to leave the light on all night, so we 'improved' the two lamps to have a timer that turns off after twenty minutes. Here's the basic setup. We used this IKEA LED lamp. It has a wall socket transformer that produces an output of 4 volts; a cable runs from the transformer to the lamp, with a switch in the middle. The lamp itself is a single white LED, which probably needs about 3.3 volts; I didn't verify this. We insert the timer somewhere in the cord. It doesn't matter whether the timer is before or after the switch, it works the same in both cases. The timer is based on a capacitor discharging through a resistor, coupled to a MOSFET transistor, and it doesn't contain more than those three components.
