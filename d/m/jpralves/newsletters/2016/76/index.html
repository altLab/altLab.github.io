<p>Faz hoje 132 anos que foi estabelecida a longitude do Meridiano de Tempo Universal (Universal Time) em Greenwich. E ficamos a saber esta semana que os "dois" Arduinos voltaram a entender-se e a unir a marca. Massimo Banzi e Federico Must, na MakerFaire de Nova Iorque apresentaram a novidade. Esta semana também foi apresentado um estudo na revista Nature onde é anunciado um novo tipo de redes neuronais designado por redes neuronais diferenciáveis. Uma empresa finlandesa - a Cajo Technologies - desenvolveu uma nova tecnologia laser que consegue reproduzir em diversas superfícies padrões de cor distintos. Esta semana ficamos também a saber que a missão ExoMars 2016 irá entrar em órbita de MArte no próximo dia 19 e Outubro. Esta missão é resultado de uma joint-venture entre a ESA e Russa Roscosmos. A principal missão é fazer um inventário detalhado dos gases presentes na atmosfera deste planeta.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como alguns modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis. Na rubrica "Documentação" apresentamos um livro sobre o essencial do C e a newelectronics de 11 de Outubro 2016.</p>

<p><em>"For more than a decade, engineers have been eyeing the finish line in the race to shrink the size of components in integrated circuits. They knew that the laws of physics had set a 5-nanometer threshold on the size of transistor gates among conventional semiconductors, about one-quarter the size of high-end 20-nanometer-gate transistors now on the market. Some laws are made to be broken, or at least challenged. A research team led by faculty scientist Ali Javey at the Department of Energys Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) has done just that by creating a transistor with a working 1-nanometer gate. For comparison, a strand of human hair is about 50,000 nanometers thick."</em> <a href="http://newscenter.lbl.gov/2016/10/06/smallest-transistor-1-nm-gate/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"A new paper recently published in the Journal of Molecular Biology shows how advances in molecular biology and computer science around the world soon may lead to a three-dimensional computer model of a cell, the fundamental unit of life. According to the authors, the development could herald a new era for biological research, medical science, and human and animal health. The study, titled Challenges in structural approaches to cell modeling, surveys a range of methodologies joining the march toward a simulated whole 3-D cell, including the studies of biological networks, automated construction of 3-D cell models with experimental data, modeling of protein complexes, prediction of protein interactions, thermodynamic and kinetic effects of crowding cellular membrane modeling, and modeling of chromosomes."</em> <a href="http://news.ku.edu/2016/09/20/researchers-say-science-cusp-transformational-grasp-life-cell-modeling">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Anyone whos watched drone videos or an episode of BattleBots knows that robots can break  and often its because they dont have the proper padding to protect themselves. But this week researchers at MITs Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) will present a new method for 3-D printing soft materials that make robots safer and more precise in their movements  and that could be used to improve the durability of drones, phones, shoes, helmets, and more. The teams programmable viscoelastic material (PVM) technique allows users to program every single part of a 3D-printed object to the exact levels of stiffness and elasticity they want, depending on the task they need for it."</em> <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/3D_printed_robots_with_shock_absorbing_skins">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"3-D printing has progressed over the last decade to include multi-material fabrication, enabling production of powerful, functional objects. While many advances have been made, it still has been difficult for non-programmers to create objects made of many materials (or mixtures of materials) without a more user-friendly interface. But this week, a team from MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) will present Foundry, a system for custom-designing a variety of 3-D printed objects with multiple materials."</em> <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/designing_for_3D_printing">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"New research, led by the University of Southampton, has demonstrated that a nanoscale device, called a memristor, could be used to power artificial systems that can mimic the human brain. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) exhibit learning abilities and can perform tasks which are difficult for conventional computing systems, such as pattern recognition, on-line learning and classification. Practical ANN implementations are currently hampered by the lack of efficient hardware synapses; a key component that every ANN requires in large numbers."</em> <a href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/news/2016/09/memristor-brain.page">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"For decades, scientists have tried to harness the unique properties of carbon nanotubes to create high-performance electronics that are faster or consume less power  resulting in longer battery life, faster wireless communication and faster processing speeds for devices like smartphones and laptops. But a number of challenges have impeded the development of high-performance transistors made of carbon nanotubes, tiny cylinders made of carbon just one atom thick. Consequently, their performance has lagged far behind semiconductors such as silicon and gallium arsenide used in computer chips and personal electronics. Now, for the first time, University of WisconsinMadison materials engineers have created carbon nanotube transistors that outperform state-of-the-art silicon transistors."</em> <a href="http://news.wisc.edu/for-first-time-carbon-nanotube-transistors-outperform-silicon/">[...]</a></p>

Researchers now report a clever way to make the gossamer threads even stronger and tougher: by feeding silkworms graphene or single-walled carbon nanotubes. The reinforced silk produced by the silkworms could be used in applications such as durable protective fabrics, biodegradable medical implants, and ecofriendly wearable electronics, they say. Researchers have previously added dyes, antimicrobial agents, conductive polymers, and nanoparticles to silkeither by treating spun silk with the additives or, in some cases, by directly feeding the additives to silkworms. Silkworms, the larvae of mulberry-eating silk moths, spin their threads from a solution of silk protein produced in their salivary glands."</em> <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/silkworms-spin-super-silk-after-eating-carbon-nanotubes-and-graphene/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Sending data over an RF link to a PC. There are many articles on the internet describing how someone can add wireless capabilities to a project. A plethora range of options and technologies exist and the choice is based upon the specific application. In general, sub-1GHz frequencies are used for long range applications. The selection of the rf module is made after considering amongst others, the desired range, bandwidth, reliability and cost. Obviously, the cheaper the module, the less reliable it is. Most of the hobby projects on the internet that employ RF communication, use Arduinos and special software libraries, like VirtualWire. The later provides Manchester encoding/decoding routines to balance the voltages used for the RF receiver gain averaging circuit. This instructable however, describes how you can make a Pic microcontroller talk to a cheap RF module (433MHz) through its USART port, to send data over a wireless link to another Pic. The first part demonstrates how to program a PIC12F1822 to send a simple string to an RF transmitter, and then how to get this string through an RF receiver and display it on a terminal application."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Wireless-Communication-Using-Cheap-433MHz-RF-Modul/">[...]</a></p>

So a solar charging circuit was proposed to user free energy from the sun to charge the batteries and to power your beloved Arduino."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Solar-Charged-Battery-Powered-Arduino-Uno/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"The Internet-of-Things Power Meter (IPM) is a device fixed on top of the regular household power meter that provides detailed information about the electricity usage. Modern power meters have a LED blinking every time a watt-hour is used, the IPM detects these flashes using a light sensor, counts them, saves the values to an SD card. Later the data is stored to the cloud.  Usually power companies provide very rough electricity usage data, the IPM provides data with a minute resolution. Knowing the household electricity usage allows to extrapolate statistics and can give precise numbers about the costs. The IPM was made with simplicity of assembly and cost in mind. The device is easy to build, program and cheap to deploy and use. One can basically buy the parts, assemble, program and deploy it without any knowledge about the inner workings, however contribution to the development of this open-source project is welcome and encouraged."</em> <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/6938-internet-of-things-power-meter">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"This project helps you control 8 relays using RS485 link with the help of a PC. This kit can effectively convert a standard PC to a powerful   PLC ( programmable logic controller ). At the PC end , you will need to use our RS232 to RS485 Interface  C020 or any other suitable RS232 to RS485 Converter. The project can offer a low-cost serial relay contact interface, easy to use with Visual Basic, Basic, C, Labview, Testpoint, or other high level languages that allow access to a serial port. You can simply use the accompanying software provided with this project or issue control commands using any popular Terminal Port software available on the net."</em> <a href="http://www.electronics-lab.com/project/8-channel-rs485-relay-board/">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Ping-Pong-Pinball/">Arduino Ping Pong Pinball</a></h2>

<p><em>"This project will construct a pinball type game using a ping pong ball and a playfield made from solenoids, u-brackets, a continuous rotation servo and erector set parts. The goal of the game is to deposit the ping pong ball into u-bracket targets. The targets represent varying degrees of difficulty with the harder targets awarding more points than the easier ones. Score is kept automatically and displayed on an LCD readout. Solenoids act as flippers and also eject the ball from the u-bracket targets. A spinning arm attached to a continuous rotation servo adds an element of unpredictability to the game. The guide rails and obstacles are constructed with erector set parts and plastic standoffs."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Ping-Pong-Pinball/">[...]</a></p>
