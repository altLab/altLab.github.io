<p>Esta semana ficamos a conhecer a nova aposta da Mozilla para o IoT - Chirimen. Passaram-se 30 anos desde o lançamento do MIPS R2000. Cálculos complexos fazem "crashar" os CPU da família Skylake da Intel. Foi lançado o Kernel Linux 4.4. A Amazon anunciou a plataforma Alpine PoC que usa o ARMv7 e o ARMv8.</p>

<p>Esta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker e na rubrica "Documentação" apresentamos quatro livros (eBooks) que podem ser descarregados livremente e que esta semana são sobre Raspberry PI, Projetos de electrónica, Python e Open Source. Falamos também nas revistas Programar de Dezembro e a MagPI de Janeiro.</p>

<p><img src="NS37_ChirimenHelloRealWorld.jpg" alt="NS37_ChirimenHelloRealWorld" /></p>

<p><em>"CHIRIMEN is designed for Web developers to MAKE Real things that are connected to the Web. The CHIRIMEN is powered by Boot to Gecko and uses GPIO/I2C WebAPIs to control devices using web technologies."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://blog.imgtec.com/mips-processors/thirty-years-of-mips-r2000">It's been 30 years since the launch of MIPS R2000</a></p>

<p><img src="NS37_ItSBeen30YearsSinceTheLaunchOf.jpg" alt="NS37_ItSBeen30YearsSinceTheLaunchOf" /></p>

<p>_"A decade before IBM launched the world’s first smartphone, a team of Stanford University researchers and Silicon Valley veterans came together to design a microprocessor architecture that would forever change the landscape of computing. The year was 1986 and the newly-formed company was MIPS Computer Systems Inc. – a small start-up led by current-day Stanford University president John L. Hennessy. This is the story of MIPS R2000, the first commercially-available microprocessor chipset to implement the MIPS instruction set architecture (ISA) and the first RISC processor widely sold through a profitable licensing business model that has become so widespread today."</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.iupac.org/news/news-detail/article/discovery-and-assignment-of-elements-with-atomic-numbers-113-115-117-and-118.html">Simple instructions for freezing a Skylake Processor</a></p>

<p><img src="NS37_SimpleInstructionsForFreezingA.jpg" alt="NS37_SimpleInstructionsForFreezingA" /></p>

<p><em>"The people at the community over at http://www.mersenneforum.org have found what appears to be a bug in the new Skylake architecture that can freeze any system that has a Skylake processor. The Mersenne community are a bunch of mathematicians and other folks that use Intel processors to find record prime numbers. They have found all the record prime numbers of the last 20 years. The main website of the community is http://www.mersenne.org where they keep track of all progress in searching for a new record prime number. Owners of Skylake systems have found out that the software package that they use to hunt for prime numbers will freeze their system if they use particular settings. Since this bug is reproducible and has been confirmed on motherboards of many different suppliers and with RAM modules of different suppliers the bug seems to be tied to the processor architecture. The bug is reproducible under Windows and Linux. This software works perfectly normal on all other Intel processors of past generations."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="NS37_Linux44Released.jpg" alt="NS37_Linux44Released" /></p>

<p><em>"Linux 4.4 has been released This release adds support for 3D support in virtual GPU driver, which allows 3D hardware-accelerated graphics in virtualization guests; loop device support for Direct I/O and Asynchronous I/O, which saves memory and increases performance; support for Open-channel SSDs, which are devices that share the responsibility of the Flash Translation Layer with the operating system; the TCP listener handling is completely lockless and allows for faster and more scalable TCP servers; journalled RAID5 in the MD layer which fixes the RAID write hole; eBPF programs can now be run by unprivileged users, and perf has added support for eBPF programs aswell; a new mlock2() syscall that allows users to request memory to be locked on page fault; and block polling support. There are also new drivers and many other small improvements."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT37_RiceMakesLightDrivenNanosubmar.jpg" alt="CT37_RiceMakesLightDrivenNanosubmar" /></p>

<p>_"Though they're not quite ready for boarding a lá “Fantastic Voyage,” nanoscale submarines created at Rice University are proving themselves seaworthy. Each of the single-molecule, 244-atom submersibles built in the Rice lab of chemist James Tour has a motor powered by ultraviolet light. With each full revolution, the motor's tail-like propeller moves the sub forward 18 nanometers. And with the motors running at more than a million RPM, that translates into speed. Though the sub's top speed amounts to less than 1 inch per second, Tour said that's a breakneck pace on the molecular scale."</p></li>

<p><img src="CT37_Making3DImaging1000TimesBetter.jpg" alt="CT37_Making3DImaging1000TimesBetter" /></p>

<p><em>"MIT researchers have shown that by exploiting the polarization of light — the physical phenomenon behind polarized sunglasses and most 3-D movie systems — they can increase the resolution of conventional 3-D imaging devices as much as 1,000 times."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT37_FacedirectorContinuousControlO.jpg" alt="CT37_FacedirectorContinuousControlO" /></p>

<p><em>"We present a method to continuously blend between multiple facial performances of an actor, which can contain different facial expressions or emotional states. As an example, given sad and angry video takes of a scene, our method empowers a movie director to specify arbitrary weighted combinations and smooth transitions between the two takes in post-production. Our contributions include (1) a robust nonlinear audio-visual synchronization technique that exploits complementary properties of audio and visual cues to automatically determine robust, dense spatio-temporal correspondences between takes, and (2) a seamless facial blending approach that provides the director full control to interpolate timing, facial expression, and local appearance, in order to generate novel performances after filming. In contrast to most previous works, our approach operates entirely in image space, avoiding the need of 3D facial reconstruction. We demonstrate that our method can synthesize visually believable performances with applications in emotion transition, performance correction, and timing control."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT37_ANewWayToPrint3DMetalsAndAlloy.jpg" alt="CT37_ANewWayToPrint3DMetalsAndAlloy" /></p>

<p><em>"A team of Northwestern Engineers has created a new way to print three-dimensional metallic objects using rust and metal powders. While current methods rely on vast metal powder beds and expensive lasers or electron beams, Northwestern’s new technique uses liquid inks and common furnaces, resulting in a cheaper, faster, and more uniform process. The Northwestern team also demonstrated that the new method works for an extensive variety of metals, metal mixtures, alloys, and metal oxides and compounds."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT37_ANewTypeOf3DPrintedCeramicCoul.jpg" alt="CT37_ANewTypeOf3DPrintedCeramicCoul" /></p>

<p><em>"Because they are strong, light, and heat-resistant, ceramics are an incredibly important material for aerospace applications, such as hypersonic jets and space shuttles. That's why 3-D printing ceramics could be useful for companies designing aerospace precision parts like Boeing, Space X, and NASA. Except for one problem: 3-D printed ceramics aren't tough enough to go to space. But a new material design innovation may have just put that problem in the past."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/will-this-fancy-metallic-glue-kill-soldering">MesoGlue - Will This Fancy Metallic Glue Kill Soldering?</a></p>

<p><img src="CT37_MesoglueWillThisFancyMetallicG.jpg" alt="CT37_MesoglueWillThisFancyMetallicG" /></p>

<p><em>"If you want to piss off an electrical engineer, tell them that future electronics might be built using a room-temperature metallic glue instead of conventional soldering techniques. Despite the tedium, burns, bad joins, and dangerous lead fumes, soldering is a prized and hard-fought skill. It's also unavoidable: a technique central to absolutely everything to do with building and repairing electronics at all levels. Materials scientists at Northeastern University in Boston are daring to suggest, however, that its days may be numbered. This is thanks to a recent creation dubbed MesoGlue: a "revolutionary joining solution that lets you attach items together with a metal bond, at room temperature." Soldering without the heat, in other words. The new material is described in this month's Advanced Materials and Processes."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"I anatomize a successful open-source project, fetchmail, that was run as a deliberate test of the surprising theories about software engineering suggested by the history of Linux. I discuss these theories in terms of two fundamentally different development styles, the <code>cathedral'' model of most of the commercial world versus the</code>bazaar'' model of the Linux world. I show that these models derive from opposing assumptions about the nature of the software-debugging task. I then make a sustained argument from the Linux experience for the proposition that ``Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow'', suggest productive analogies with other self-correcting systems of selfish agents, and conclude with some exploration of the implications of this insight for the future of software."</em></p></li>

<p>Com a disponibilidade de ferramentas que permitem dar azo a nossa imaginação na criação de peças 3D e espaços como o <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/">thingiverse</a> para as publicar, esta rubrica apresenta alguns modelos selecionados que poderão ser úteis.</p>

<h2>Fully Customizable Twisted Gears (Parametric) (<a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1241118">http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1241118</a>)</h2>

<p><img src="MP37_FullyCustomizableTwistedGearsP.jpg" alt="Modelos3D_1_FullyCustomizableTwistedGears" /></p>

<p>Wow!
These things are cool.
Using the customizer, you can create a gear(s) that can have any size, and all dimensions of the gear and its teeth are customizable.</p>

<p>Customizing in OpenSCAD is faster, and you can use my built in animation features. Please ignore the "animate" variable when using Customizer. To animate this model, set your frame rate, and set the steps to 360. Then, change "animate" from 0 to 1. you can set it back to 0 to re-center the gears so they are 90 / 45 offset instead of arbitrarily.</p>

<p>Note:
When printing NON-double gears, be sure to mirror one of them. Otherwise, they will not mesh. When printing doubled gears, they will always mesh one way or another.</p>

<h2>Braille Learning Board (<a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1250378">http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1250378</a>)</h2>

<p><img src="MP37_BrailleLearningBoard.jpg" alt="Modelos3D_2_BrailleLearningBoard" /></p>

<p>This 3d model is a board that can be used to teach people braille. All of the letters of the alphabet are on this board.</p>

<h2>Support for Dremel 4000 (<a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1259799">http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1259799</a>)</h2>

<p><img src="MP37_SupportForDremel4000.jpg" alt="Modelos3D_3_SupportDremel4000" /></p>

<p><img src="PM37_IntroducingEasyPulseADiyPhotop.jpg" alt="PM37_IntroducingEasyPulseADiyPhotop" /></p>

<p><em>"When I first built the Heart rate measurement through fingertip project, the infrared LED and photodiode used for finger photoplethysmography were actually from salvaged parts, and therefore, I could not provide specifications for them in the article. As a result of that it takes quite a bit of time to replicate that project with a different set of IR LED and photodiode as the values of the current limiting and biasing resistors may have to be changed for the new sensor to work properly. Today, I am going to talk about a revised version of the same project but with all the components specified this time. The new version uses the TCRT1000 reflective optical sensor for photoplethysmography. The use of TCRT100 simplifies the build process of the sensor part of the project as both the infrared light emitter diode and the detector are arranged side by side in a leaded package, thus blocking the surrounding ambient light, which could otherwise affect the sensor performance. I have also designed a printed circuit board for it, which carries both sensor and signal conditioning unit. I have named the board “Easy Pulse” and its output is a digital pulse which is synchronous with the heart beat. The output pulse can be fed to either an ADC channel or a digital input pin of a microcontroller for further processing and retrieving the heart rate in beats per minute (BPM)."</em></p>

<p><em>"Sending data from a microcontroller is a pretty common requirement in a lot of the projects I work on. One way of doing it is sending serial data out from the uC to a serial to usb converter chip to a computer. This has the advantage of involving very little code overhead for both the uC and the computer. It does also make it more difficult to route on a PCB (especially trying to fit it onto a single layer) and of course you have to pay for the serial/usb converter chip which in my experience range from about 2.50 to 5 euro per chip. An alternative to this is to have the uC communicate directly via usb with the computer. This can be done on a uC entirely in software – the V-USB library for atmel microcontrollers allows almost any atmel micro to communicate via usb. This creates a large CPU overhead as most of the uC’s time is spent maintaining the USB connection – leaving little time for anything else. uC’s with USB hardware in them offset this problem to a certain extent by including dedicated USB hardware so less CPU time is needed to use USB. The LUFA (Lightweight USB Framwork for AVRs) is a library aimed at taking advantage of this USB hardware. It comes with loads of examples that work with several types of atmel chips. The one that I chose is the atmega16u2 because it was pretty cheap and it was used the arduino uno as the usb-serial converter for the board. This meant that there was schematics of the board layout available online which came in very hany for making my own board. This board was intended to be used as part of the PlantBot project I’m working on but it ended up just being a LUFA virtual serial test board."</em></p>

Basically I have 20 5mm full colour LED’s, meaning I have 60 LED’s in total. so at this point I had another think about how I was going to drive all the LED’s and then realised I had the solution in a 8*8 full colour matrix, I had already used a Funduino/colorduino when I made my Plasma box, so this was a logical solution."</em></p>
