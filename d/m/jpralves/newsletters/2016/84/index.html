<h2><a href="https://blog.google/topics/environment/100-percent-renewable-energy/">We’re set to reach 100% renewable energy — and it’s just the beginning</a></h2>

<p><em>"Every year people search on Google trillions of times; every minute people upload more than 400 hours of YouTube videos. All of that takes an incredible amount of processing power — which means energy. Our engineers have spent years perfecting Google's data centers, making them 50 percent more energy efficient than the industry average. But we still need a lot of energy to power the products and services that our users depend on. We began purchasing renewable energy to reduce our carbon footprint and address climate change — but it also makes business sense. I’m thrilled to announce that in 2017 Google will reach 100% renewable energy for our global operations — including both our data centers and offices. We were one of the first corporations to create large-scale, long-term contracts to buy renewable energy directly; we signed our first agreement to purchase all the electricity from a 114-megawatt wind farm in Iowa, in 2010. Today, we are the world’s largest corporate buyer of renewable power, with commitments reaching 2.6 gigawatts (2,600 megawatts) of wind and solar energy. That’s bigger than many large utilities and more than twice as much as the 1.21 gigawatts it took to send Marty McFly back to the future."</em> <a href="https://blog.google/topics/environment/100-percent-renewable-energy/">[...]</a></p>

Someday, the high-tech stamping that produces such a sticker might also bring us food packaging that displays a digital countdown to warn of spoiling produce, or even a window pane that shows the day’s forecast, based on measurements of the weather conditions outside. Engineers at MIT have invented a fast, precise printing process that may make such electronic surfaces an inexpensive reality. In a paper published today in Science Advances, the researchers report that they have fabricated a stamp made from forests of carbon nanotubes that is able to print electronic inks onto rigid and flexible surfaces."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2016/stamping-technique-printable-electronics-1207">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Previously it was only possible to study these flaws in large numbers. However, fundamental research conducted by University of Twente scientists has now made it possible to zoom in on defects and study them individually. In due course, this knowledge will be highly relevant to the further development of the semiconductor industry. The research results were published today in Scientific Reports, a leading scientific journal produced by the Nature Publishing Group. Computer chips typically contain numerous extremely small defects. There are often as many as ten billion defects per square centimetre. The bulk of these defects cause no problems in practice, but the large numbers involved pose enormous challenges for the industry. This is just one of the barriers to the further miniaturization of chips, based on existing technology. It is, therefore, vital to obtain a detailed understanding of how these defects arise, of where they are located, and of how they behave. Until now it has been impossible to study individual defects, due to the large number of defects on each chip, and the fact that closely spaced defects influence each other. For this reason, the defects were always studied in ensembles of several million at a time. However, this approach suffers from the drawback that it only yields a limited amount of information on individual defects.

<p><em>"How much electricity flows through the grid? When and where? Where are the bottlenecks? What happens when wind turbines and solar cells feed in additional energy? The answer to these questions are essential for the global energy turnaround. However, for a valid planning, one first needs a solid understanding of the infrastructure. Researchers at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) are now collecting information via an open source platform accessible to everyone. Hundreds of volunteers are already underway, and their numbers are growing every day. Armed with the OpenGridMap app on their smart phones, they meander through Munich, Berlin, Tokyo and even Teheran. Just another cell phone game? “No, we aren’t chasing Pokémons,” reassures Jose Rivera, director of the OpenGridMap project. “What we are interested in is the electrical infrastructure: High-voltage and low-voltage power lines, transformer sub-stations, wind turbines and solar power plants.” Users of the app share photos and locations with a server housed in the Department of Computer Science at TU Munich. There, the information is analyzed, evaluated and ultimately loaded into the open source OpenStreetMap map system."</em> <a href="https://www.tum.de/en/about-tum/news/press-releases/detail/article/33578/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"For more than 50 years, silicon chipmakers have devised inventive ways to switch electricity on and off, generating the digital ones and zeroes that encode words, pictures, movies and other forms of data. But as researchers think about electronics for the next 50 years, they’ve begun to look beyond silicon to new types of materials that occur in single layers only three atoms thick – far thinner than modern silicon chips – yet are able to control electricity more efficiently to create those digital ones and zeroes. Now a team led by Stanford electrical engineering Associate Professor Eric Pop has demonstrated how it might be possible to mass-produce such atomically thin materials and electronics. Why would this be useful? Because such thin materials would be transparent and flexible as well, in ways that would enable electronic devices that wouldn’t be possible to make with silicon."</em> <a href="http://news.stanford.edu/2016/11/29/stanford-engineers-create-prototype-chip-just-three-atoms-thick/">[...]</a></p>

There are Arduino libraries written to talk to the mouse and get the direction of the distance of rotation of the encoder wheels. By connecting the encoder wheel to a filament roller, we can track the actual usage of the filament for each project by using the Arduino and display the results in millimeter on a LCD display.

<p><em>"This project consists of a a device capable of generating a (pseudo) random blinking lights pattern. The objective of this project is to turn old monitors, specially CRTs, into decorative objects. The VGA video generation is performed by the PIC counting cycle by cycle. At 20MHz the PIC executes one instruction cycle at each 200ns. It means that a whole VGA line (31,77us) shall last 159 cycles. This value is rounded up but close enough for a stable image (full detail) The VGA output is impedance and amplitude controlled. It can be achieved by doing some math. The values are not critical, though. Anything about 20% of the calculated values are good enough. The randomness is generated by using a Galois LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register) with a different seed for each line of 8 'dots'. The code was borrowed from PICLIST. The timing for colour changing is done counting frames on the last blank line of a screen. The interval time is formed by adding 22 with the 4 least significant bits of one of the random variables used to control the colour of the dots. This results in a time of .36 to .63 seconds for each change. And that's all."</em> <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/8537-vga-blinking-lights">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"The year is coming to an end, the Holiday season is approaching. In case you are looking for a nice present: I have completed my version of a sand clock: a clock writing the time into sand. The idea is based on the famous ‘Plotclock’ by the Fab Lab Nürnberg (https://wiki.fablab-nuernberg.de/w/Ding:Plotclock). That Plotclock is using a whiteboard marker to write the time and erases it with a wiper ever minute: very cool idea!"</em> <a href="https://mcuoneclipse.com/2016/11/23/making-of-sea-shell-sand-clock/">[...]</a></p>

This program was very long and complicated, so I've downloaded it from the Internet. I've started to think if I am able to also make it myself. But why should I start with something so hard, firstly let's make something easier - Plotter!"</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Drawing-Plotter/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"As I was making a word clock, based on another instructable ( http://www.instructables.com/id/My-Arduino-WordClock/ ), me and my sister were wondering whether a round design would be cool too. While searching the internet, I could not find a round word clock, so we decided to design/create one ourselves. The clock displays the time somewhat similar as on a regular word clock. There are two major differences, on a 'regular' word clock the hours are words. On our word clock they're numbers just like a normal clock. The minutes (in 5 minute steps) are replaced by a word on the clock and the location of the word provides extra information. Note that I use Dutch templates, but an English version should work too. Of course some changes to the software are required."</em> <a href="https://rhoalt.blogspot.pt/2016/09/a-round-word-clock-sort-of.html">[...]</a></p>

I will be using a rtl dongle to receive my input signal on 70cm frequency configurable on the amateur 2m or 70cm band. The receiver signal will then be demodulated and re transmitted with a DSP Library simulating a FM Signal using a GPIO pin on the Raspberry as an transmitter."</em> <a href="http://zr6aic.blogspot.pt/2016/11/creating-2m-fm-repeater-with-raspberry.html">[...]</a></p>

On board potentiometer provided for speed control, slide switch for direction control and brake, On board jumper available to enable the chip. The controller function in normal manner with a PWM frequency of approximately 25Khz. Motor speed is controlled by adjusting the voltage presented to the non inverting input of the error amplifier establishing the PWM’s slice or reference level. Cycle by cycle current limiting of the motor is accomplished by sensing the voltage across the shunt resistor to the ground of H-bridge. The overcurrent sense circuit makes it possible to reverse the direction of the motor, using normal forward/reverse switch, on the fly and not have to completely stop it before reversing."</em> <a href="http://www.electronics-lab.com/project/dc-motor-direction-controller-brake-using-mc33035/">[...]</a></p>
