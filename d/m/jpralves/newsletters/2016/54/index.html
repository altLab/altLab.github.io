<p><img src="NS54_HyperloopOneReaches187KphInFir.jpg" alt="NS54_HyperloopOneReaches187KphInFir" /></p>

<p><em>"Hyperloop One has successfully tested its levitating electromagnetic motor for future transport systems at a track in Nevada, USA. The company's electromagnetic sled reached 187kph, as reported by The Guardian, on a short open-air test track before ploughing into a pile of sand – necessary, as the test rig doesn't currently have any brakes. The test, which lasted just a few seconds, was the first demonstration of the much-hyped transportation technology."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="NS54_AnnouncingSyntaxnetTheWorldsMo.jpg" alt="NS54_AnnouncingSyntaxnetTheWorldsMo" /></p>

<p><em>"At Google, we spend a lot of time thinking about how computer systems can read and understand human language in order to process it in intelligent ways. Today, we are excited to share the fruits of our research with the broader community by releasing SyntaxNet, an open-source neural network framework implemented in TensorFlow that provides a foundation for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) systems. Our release includes all the code needed to train new SyntaxNet models on your own data, as well as Parsey McParseface, an English parser that we have trained for you and that you can use to analyze English text. Parsey McParseface is built on powerful machine learning algorithms that learn to analyze the linguistic structure of language, and that can explain the functional role of each word in a given sentence. Because Parsey McParseface is the most accurate such model in the world, we hope that it will be useful to developers and researchers interested in automatic extraction of information, translation, and other core applications of NLU."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="NS54_AHybridHydrostaticTransmission.jpg" alt="NS54_AHybridHydrostaticTransmission" /></p>

<p><em>"We present a new type of hydrostatic transmission that uses a hybrid air-water configuration, analogous to N+1 cable-tendon transmissions, using N hydraulic lines and 1 pneumatic line for a system with N degrees of freedom (DOFs). The common air-filled line preloads all DOFs in the system, allowing bidirectional operation of every joint. This configuration achieves the high stiffness of a water-filled transmission with half the number of bulky hydraulic lines. We implemented this transmission using pairs of rolling-diaphragm cylinders to form rotary hydraulic actuators, with a new design achieving a 600-percent increase in specific work density per cycle. These actuators were used to build a humanoid robot with two 4-DOF arms, connected via the hydrostatic transmission to an identical master. Stereo cameras mounted on a 2-DOF servo-controlled neck stream live video to the operator’s head-mounted display, which in turn sends the real-time attitude of the operator’s head to the neck servos in the robot. The operator is visually immersed in the robot’s physical workspace, and through the bilateral coupling of the low-impedance hydrostatic transmission, directly feels interaction forces between the robot and external environment. We qualitatively assessed the performance of this system for remote object manipulation and use as a platform to safely study physical human-robot interaction."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT54_WithSimpleProcessEngineersFabr.jpg" alt="CT54_WithSimpleProcessEngineersFabr" /></p>

<p><em>"One secret to creating the world’s fastest silicon-based flexible transistors: a very, very tiny knife. Working in collaboration with colleagues around the country, University of Wisconsin-Madison engineers have pioneered a unique method that could allow manufacturers to easily and cheaply fabricate high-performance transistors with wireless capabilities on huge rolls of flexible plastic. The researchers — led by Zhenqiang (Jack) Ma, the Lynn H. Matthias Professor in Engineering and Vilas Distinguished Achievement Professor in electrical and computer engineering, and research scientist Jung-Hun Seo — fabricated a transistor that operates at a record 38 gigahertz, though their simulations show it could be capable of operating at a mind-boggling 110 gigahertz. In computing, that translates to lightning-fast processor speeds."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT54_MaidenVoyageOfStanfordSHumanoi.jpg" alt="CT54_MaidenVoyageOfStanfordSHumanoi" /></p>

<p><em>"Oussama Khatib held his breath as he swam through the wreck of La Lune, 100 meters below the Mediterranean. The flagship of King Louis XIV sank here in 1664, 20 miles off the southern coast of France, and no human had touched the ruins – or the countless treasures and artifacts the ship once carried – in the centuries since. With guidance from a team of skilled deep-sea archaeologists who had studied the site, Khatib, a professor of computer science at Stanford, spotted a grapefruit-size vase. He hovered precisely over the vase, reached out, felt its contours and weight, and stuck a finger inside to get a good grip. He swam over to a recovery basket, gently laid down the vase and shut the lid. Then he stood up and high-fived the dozen archaeologists and engineers who had been crowded around him."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"Conductive tracks are usually hard printed on a board. But those recently developed at EPFL are altogether different: they are almost as flexible as rubber and can be stretched up to four times their original length and in all directions. And they can be stretched a million times without cracking or interrupting their conductivity. The invention is described in an article published today in the journal Advanced Materials. Both solid and flexible, this new metallic and partially liquid film offers a wide range of possible applications. It could be used to make circuits that can be twisted and stretched – ideal for artificial skin on prosthetics or robotic machines. It could also be integrated into fabric and used in connected clothing. And because it follows the shape and movements of the human body, it could be used for sensors designed to monitor particular biological functions."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.ccm.pitt.edu/news/blue-light-exposure-reduces-organ-damage-mice-crisma-researchers-find">Blue Light Exposure Reduces Organ Damage in Mice, CRISMA Researchers Find</a></p>

<p><img src="CT54_BlueLightExposureReducesOrganD.jpg" alt="CT54_BlueLightExposureReducesOrganD" /></p>

<p><em>"New research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on April 25 points to an intriguing correlation between pre-surgical exposure to blue light and improved outcomes in mice, specifically a reduction in inflammation and organ damage. The article, “Blue light reduces organ injury from ischemia and reperfusion,” was senior authored by Matthew R. Rosengart, MD, MPH, Associate Professor in the Department of Surgery and a secondary faculty member in the Department of Critical Care Medicine. This research was performed in the Department of Surgery and the CRISMA Center, Clinical Epidemiology Program, Department of Critical Care Medicine. This finding, which is one of the first to consider the complexity of light, builds on early observational studies on the potential role of light in critical illness led by former CRISMA fellow Ricardo Castro, who was mentored by Rosengart and Derek C. Angus, MD, MPH, FRCP, Director of the CRISMA Center and coauthor of the research."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT54_MicrosoftJoinsHandsWithTwistBi.jpg" alt="CT54_MicrosoftJoinsHandsWithTwistBi" /></p>

<p><em>"Microsoft has struck a contract with Twist Bioscience - a new forensic startup to develop and use synthetic DNA strands to store information so that data can be safely stored for thousands of years. The company purchased 10 million molecules from the startup. According to IEEE, the company has successfully transferred a chunk of data on the DNA or RNA molecules, and has also extracted the information successfully. Microsoft collaborated with Twist Bioscience and together, they sequenced the 10 million molecules accordingly. Twist Bioscience does not have any information stored on the stands, however, in order to extract and decode the information, DNA sequencing is needed and it doesn’t have the key to do so."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT54_GrapheneBasedMicrobotsForToxic.jpg" alt="CT54_GrapheneBasedMicrobotsForToxic" /></p>

<p><em>"Heavy metal contamination in water is a serious risk to the public health and other life forms on earth. Current research in nanotechnology is developing new nanosystems and nanomaterials for the fast and efficient removal of pollutants and heavy metals from water. Here, we report graphene oxide-based microbots (GOx-microbots) as active self-propelled systems for the capture, transfer, and removal of a heavy metal (i.e., lead) and its subsequent recovery for recycling purposes. Microbots’ structure consists of nanosized multilayers of graphene oxide, nickel, and platinum, providing different functionalities. The outer layer of graphene oxide captures lead on the surface, and the inner layer of platinum functions as the engine decomposing hydrogen peroxide fuel for self-propulsion, while the middle layer of nickel enables external magnetic control of the microbots. Mobile GOx-microbots remove lead 10 times more efficiently than nonmotile GOx-microbots, cleaning water from 1000 ppb down to below 50 ppb in 60 min. Furthermore, after chemical detachment of lead from the surface of GOx-microbots, the microbots can be reused. Finally, we demonstrate the magnetic control of the GOx-microbots inside a microfluidic system as a proof-of-concept for automatic microbots-based system to remove and recover heavy metals."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"A computer program, from one perspective, is a sequence of instructions that dictate the flow of electrical impulses within a computer system. These impulses affect the computer’s memory and interact with the display screen, keyboard, mouse, and perhaps even other computers across a network in such a way as to produce the “magic” that permits humans to perform useful tasks, solve high-level problems, and play games. One program allows a computer to assume the role of a financial calculator, while another transforms the machine into a worthy chess opponent."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"In 1960, the United States put its first Earth-observing environmental satellite into orbit around the planet. Over the decades, these satellites have provided invaluable information, and the vantage point of space has provided new perspectives on Earth. This book celebrates Earth’s aesthetic beauty in the patterns, shapes, colors, and textures of the land, oceans, ice, and atmosphere. Earth-observing environmental satellites can measure outside the visible range of light, so these images show more than what is visible to the naked eye. The beauty of Earth is clear, and the artistry ranges from the surreal to the sublime. Truly, by escaping Earth’s gravity we discovered its attraction. "</em></p></li>

<p>Com a disponibilidade de ferramentas que permitem dar azo a nossa imaginação na criação de peças 3D e espaços como o <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/">thingiverse</a> para as publicar, esta rubrica apresenta alguns modelos selecionados que poderão ser úteis.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:185912">Math Gear(s)</a></h2>

<p><img src="MP54_MathGearS.jpg" alt="MP54_MathGearS" /></p>

<p>NEW VERSION!!! POSTED 12-29-13
At first glance the updates are barely noticeable, but every piece has been revised. The changes make assembly easier with better fit and smoother operation.</p>

<p>This Math manipulative is designed to appear playful from the first look. It lies flat on desk top, so it will also work well with overhead projection systems.</p>

<p>Behind the mechanical fun there are several simple ratio exercises. The eight tooth "Idler" gear is supplied to add reverse rotation without affecting the ratios. Each interchangeable gear has built-in graphics to indicate the number of teeth as well as rotation position. Some gear ratio formulas can be found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gear_ratio.</p>

<p>Rubber bands provide tension to keep the wheels engaged no matter what the combination.</p>

<p>FYI, the "T" on the gears stands for "teeth".</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12616">Hobby Clamps</a></h2>

<p><img src="MP54_HobbyClamps.jpg" alt="MP54_HobbyClamps" /></p>

<p>Fully printable, functional mini clamps. Capable of maintaining up to five pounds of clamping force.</p>

<p>Mini Clamp with 85mm clamping capacity</p>

<p>Mini Spreader Clamp with 110mm capacity</p>

<p>Changes made:</p>

<p>Slightly shorter to better fit the TOM build platform</p>

<p>Jaw changed to slide more easily on Bar</p>

<p>Lip added to Jaw and to Wedge for easier one handed clamping/unclamping.</p>

<p>Three more sizes of Wedges. Wedge2 is the standard size. If the jaw fits too loosely or too tightly, try one of the other sizes. The "ClampWedges" file has one of each size of wedge so that you can test the different fits.</p>

<p>Added the Spreader Clamp</p>

<p>Added 140mm blank Bar</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1024834">Drill bit sharpener</a></h2>

<p><img src="MP54_DrillBitSharpener.jpg" alt="MP54_DrillBitSharpener" /></p>

<p>I've researched many existing approaches to drill bit sharpening but did not find one that I like. I like simple and utilitarian designs. This is one of those: a one-piece guide for sharpening drill bits on a Dremel or similar rotary tool.</p>

<p>There are 3 guides included: 90, 118 and 135 degrees. The majority of people will need the 118* and for that the adapter comes in two sizes such that it can easily fit both small and large diameter drills, as well as different diameters in cutting/grinding disks.</p>

<p>The adapter prints in one piece without support and is threaded to screw right onto the Dremel (I've tested it on Dremel 285, 8000 and generic Alltrade tool). It's also designed to accommodate mandrel upgrades.</p>

<p>Feel free to tweak but note the non-commercial use, please contact me for a separate license if you are interested.</p>

<p><em>"With the IoT booming nowadays, the number of connected devices grows exponentially and so does the related software that drives them. There is no doubt that Firmware Over The Air (FOTA) is a highly desirable  if not required  feature for any embedded project/product both DIY or commercial. Being able to provide a remote firmware update is obviously very beneficial. The opportunity here is to enhance product functionality, operational features and provide fixes for particular issues.  Updating the firmware OTA may eliminate the need to bring a product into a service center for a repair. Although not every issue can be resolved with a firmware update, if one is available for a particular issue, it can save a lot of time and money."</em></p></li>

This mechanism is actually pretty simple, it is just an impulse motor (two coils) and a couple of gears - no further complications. This is a blessing and also a curse for these antique clocks because for their operation they now require something called a master clock. Master clock is an electronic device that sends pulses to these slave clocks so that they can work."</em></p></li>

LED channel currents are programmed together via an external RSET resistor. Low output voltage operation on the LED channels as low as 0.4 V (for 2 to 100 mA LED current) allows for more power efficient designs. A high-speed 4-wire serial interface of up to 25 MHz clock frequency controls each individual channel using a shift register and latch configuration. A serial output data pin (SOUT) allows multiple devices to be cascaded and programmed via one serial interface. The device also includes a blanking control pin (BLANK) that can be used to disable all channels independently of the interface. Thermal shutdown protection is incorporated in the device to disable the LED outputs if the die temperature exceeds a set limit."</em></p></li>

You dont have to be an EE to need one, you'll need one even if you're just a tinkerer who enjoys repairing stuff around the house. For basic applications, a standard soldering iron that you plug into the wall does the job, but for more sensitive work like repairing and building electronic circuits, you'll need a soldering station. The temperature control is critical as to not burn the components, especially the integrated circuits. In addition, you may also need it to be powerful enough to maintain a certain temperature in case you find yourself a big ground plane that you want to solder to. As a student attending University far from home, I found that it was impractical to uninstall my soldering station from my workbench to bring it back and forth when I visit home.

In my design I have included an 8-way relay board that uses 4 relays to switch 4 of the 5-way power strip outlets, with the remaining 4 relays available for hard-wiring more external devices. These relays will be able to be switched over the internet, or on a home network."</em></p></li>

To compensate and have an excuse to buy it, we will dismantle one of these, racking its main parts and replacing the original embedded electronic by an Arduino controlled remotely by an Android device. Thus, it will be very easy to add new features to the toy, like sensors for example. It is a very inexpensive way to build a robot for educational use."</em></p></li>

The plan is to implement a device to read the serial data from all the boat instruments and send that data to openCPN over a WiFI link so there are no physical wires attached. It will broadcast the data with UDP so that multiple devices can read the data at the same time.
