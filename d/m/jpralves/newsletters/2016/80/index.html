<p><em>"Step outside on October 16, and take a look at the moon. Not only will the moon be full, but on that day, the moon will be at its closest point to our planet as it orbits Earth. This makes the October full moon a supermoon. The term supermoon has entered popular consciousness in recent years. Originally a term from modern astrology for a new or full moon that occurs when the moon is within 90% of its closest approach to Earth in a given orbit, supermoon now refers more broadly to a full moon that is closer to Earth than average. But why is the moon closer to Earth at some times but not others?"</em> <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/news-articles/2016-ends-with-three-supermoons">[...]</a></p>

The RTA runs all the public transport (road, metro, maritime) in Dubai and connects with the infrastructure of greater UAE and the Gulf region beyond. Headlines will talk up the wonders of getting from Dubai to Abu Dhabi in 12 minutes, but the real stories here are how fast Hyperloop One is gaining traction and how our vision for autonomous mobility is starting to come into focus."</em> <a href="https://hyperloop-one.com/blog/we-just-made-strong-move-ahead-autonomous-mobility">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Today at BlizzCon 2016 in Anaheim, California, we announced our collaboration with Blizzard Entertainment to open up StarCraft II to AI and Machine Learning researchers around the world. For almost 20 years, the StarCraft game series has been widely recognised as the pinnacle of 1v1 competitive video games, and among the best PC games of all time. The original StarCraft was an early pioneer in eSports, played at the highest level by elite professional players since the late 90s, and remains incredibly competitive to this day. The StarCraft series longevity in competitive gaming is a testament to Blizzard's design, and their continual effort to balance and refine their games over the years. StarCraft II continues the series renowned eSports tradition, and has been the focus of our work with Blizzard."</em> <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/deepmind-and-blizzard-release-starcraft-ii-ai-research-environment/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Tinier than the AIDS virus - that is currently the circumference of the smallest transistors. The industry has shrunk the central elements of their computer chips to fourteen nanometers in the last sixty years. Conventional methods, however, are hitting physical boundaries. Researchers around the world are looking for alternatives. One method could be the self-organization of complex components from molecules and atoms. Scientists at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR) and Paderborn University have now made an important advance: the physicists conducted a current through gold-plated nanowires, which independently assembled themselves from single DNA strands. Their results have been published in the scientific journal Langmuir."</em> <a href="https://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pOid=48577&amp;pNid=99">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Engineers at the University of California San Diego have fabricated the first semiconductor-free, optically-controlled microelectronic device. Using metamaterials, engineers were able to build a microscale device that shows a 1,000 percent increase in conductivity when activated by low voltage and a low power laser. The discovery paves the way for microelectronic devices that are faster and capable of handling more power, and could also lead to more efficient solar panels. The work was published Nov. 4 in Nature Communications. The capabilities of existing microelectronic devices, such as transistors, are ultimately limited by the properties of their constituent materials, such as their semiconductors, researchers said."</em> <a href="http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/news/news_releases/release.sfe?id=2060">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/faster_programs_easier_programming">Faster programs, easier programming</a></h2>

<p><em>"Dynamic programming is a technique that can yield relatively efficient solutions to computational problems in economics, genomic analysis, and other fields. But adapting it to computer chips with multiple cores, or processing units, requires a level of programming expertise that few economists and biologists have. Researchers from MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and Stony Brook University aim to change that, with a new system that allows users to describe what they want their programs to do in very general terms. It then automatically produces versions of those programs that are optimized to run on multicore chips. It also guarantees that the new versions will yield exactly the same results that the single-core versions would, albeit much faster."</em> <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/faster_programs_easier_programming">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Researchers at Oregon State University have combined one of nature's tiny miracles, the diatom, with a version of inkjet printing and optical sensing to create an exceptional sensing device that may be up to 10 million times more sensitive than some other commonly used approaches. A patent has been approved on the new 'optofluidic' technology, and the findings published in the journal Nanoscale. When implemented in working devices, this approach might improve biomedical sensing of cancer biomarkers; be used for extraordinarily precise forensics work; save the lives of military personnel in combat situations; detect illegal drugs; or help tell whether organic food is really pesticide free or not. The enormous sensitivity and low cost of the technology may have endless applications, researchers say, ranging from health monitoring to environmental protection, biological experiments and other uses."</em> <a href="http://oregonstate.edu/ua/ncs/archives/2016/nov/new-%E2%80%98optofluidic%E2%80%99-technology-taps-power-diatoms-dramatically-improve-sensor-perfor">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Atoms, photons, and other quantum particles are often capricious and finicky by nature; very rarely at a standstill, they often collide with others of their kind. But if such particles can be individually corralled and controlled in large numbers, they may be harnessed as quantum bits, or qubits - tiny units of information whose state or orientation can be used to carry out calculations at rates significantly faster than today's semiconductor-based computer chips. In recent years, scientists have come up with ways to isolate and manipulate individual quantum particles. But such techniques have been difficult to scale up, and the lack of a reliable way to manipulate large numbers of atoms remains a significant roadblock toward quantum computing."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2016/scientists-set-traps-atoms-single-particle-precision-1103">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"A newly-developed form of transistor opens up a range of new electronic applications including wearable or implantable devices by drastically reducing the amount of power used. Devices based on this type of ultralow power transistor, developed by engineers at the University of Cambridge, could function for months or even years without a battery by 'scavenging' energy from their environment. Using a similar principle to a computer in sleep mode, the new transistor harnesses a tiny 'leakage' of electrical current, known as a near-off-state current, for its operations. This leak, like water dripping from a faulty tap, is a characteristic of all transistors, but this is the first time that it has been effectively captured and used functionally. The results, reported in the journal Science, open up new avenues for system design for the Internet of Things, in which most of the things we interact with every day are connected to the Internet."</em> <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/engineers-design-ultralow-power-transistors-that-could-function-for-years-without-a-battery">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Researchers from Polytechnique Montral, Universit de Montral and McGill University have just achieved a spectacular breakthrough in cancer research. They have developed new nanorobotic agents capable of navigating through the bloodstream to administer a drug with precision by specifically targeting the active cancerous cells of tumours. This way of injecting medication ensures the optimal targeting of a tumour and avoids jeopardizing the integrity of organs and surrounding healthy tissues. As a result, the drug dosage that is highly toxic for the human organism could be significantly reduced. This scientific breakthrough has just been published in the prestigious journal Nature Nanotechnology in an article titled Magneto-aerotactic bacteria deliver drug-containing nanoliposomes to tumour hypoxic regions. The article notes the results of the research done on mice, which were successfully administered nanorobotic agents into colorectal tumours."</em> <a href="http://www.polymtl.ca/salle-de-presse/en/newsreleases/legions-nanorobots-target-cancerous-tumours-precision">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"This is a simple holder for coin cells. I printed it so I could easily store coin cells in small drawers without the coin cells touching and probably shortening. The presets for the holder are a rather loose fit. Other coin cell holder I found here had a rather tight fit, which made removing the coin cells annoying. But this will also cause the coin cells to fall out easily (not a problem for my use case).

<p><em>"Microlathe is a little dremel-powered woodturning/watchmaker's lathe that can be printed and bolted together with all those leftover M3 nuts and bolts that came with your Makerbot. In addition to the M3 nuts/bolts, you only require a 608 bearing (I got an extra one with my Makerbot) and an 8mm diameter spring to fit the bearing-end. You probably don't even need that spring. So, if you have a Dremel handy, you can consider this "The Lathe That Came Free With The Makerbot"! Microlathe is Parametric, and makes use of a "Global Parameters" script from which the others derive shared traits such as the radius of the bolt plates, etc.. you could try printing a larger one, but bear in mind the limited space you have to print the body portions, which are already quite large for a Makerbot."</em> <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1570">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="http://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/arduino-propeller-display">DIY Arduino Propeller LED Display</a></h2>

<p><em>"You have seen Propellers in Aircrafts or in marine ships, if not in real then in movies for sure. In this session we are going to design a Propeller Display with Arduino, LEDs and a DC motor. In this Propeller Display, text will appear to be rotating in propeller fashion in a circular shape. The propeller display is in a way like LED Matrix. It contains 8 LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) which are arranged in the form of an 8*1 matrix (8 rows and 1 column). They are arranged in the form of ladder one over the other. These 8 LED can be made to display any content like text, numbers, symbols etc. This is achieved by Perception of Vision (POV), in which many still images are moved quickly one by one in a sequence, which gives a perception of animation or a moving image."</em> <a href="http://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/arduino-propeller-display">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"I created this project as a nice memento to mark the birth of my little boy. After experimenting with a copper etching of his newborn hands and feet, I decided to take it a bit further and add electronics. Each hand and foot etched from a copper PCB forms a capacitive sensor plate. An arduino measures differences in charge on each plate caused by the presence of a human hand. Depending on the relative 'signal' detected on each plate, the arduino alters the colour of 4 RGB leds set behind the board. This is kind of a proof of concept ible. I'll talk you though what I did, but hopefully this will inspire others to modify my idea and come up with something unique."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/LED-Interactive-Copper-Etching/">[...]</a></p>

It collects various data and displays them on dedicated web page and Android app. Every few months he tries to add a new sensor to it. Last time it was a daylight sensor.
