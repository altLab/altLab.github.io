<p><img src="NS39_AlphagoMasteringTheAncientGame.jpg" alt="NS39_AlphagoMasteringTheAncientGame" /></p>

<p><em>"Games are a great testing ground for developing smarter, more flexible algorithms that have the ability to tackle problems in ways similar to humans. Creating programs that are able to play games better than the best humans has a long history - the first classic game mastered by a computer was noughts and crosses (also known as tic-tac-toe) in 1952 as a PhD candidate’s project. Then fell checkers in 1994. Chess was tackled by Deep Blue in 1997. The success isn’t limited to board games, either - IBM's Watson won first place on Jeopardy in 2011, and in 2014 our own algorithms learned to play dozens of Atari games just from the raw pixel inputs. But one game has thwarted A.I. research thus far: the ancient game of Go. Invented in China over 2500 years ago, Go is played by more than 40 million people worldwide. The rules are simple: players take turns to place black or white stones on a board, trying to capture the opponent's stones or surround empty space to make points of territory. Confucius wrote about the game, and its aesthetic beauty elevated it to one of the four essential arts required of any true Chinese scholar. The game is played primarily through intuition and feel, and because of its subtlety and intellectual depth it has captured the human imagination for centuries."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="NS39_Atmega328Pb.jpg" alt="NS39_Atmega328Pb" /></p>

<p><em>"The high-performance Atmel® ATmega328PB is an 8-bit AVR RISC-based microcontroller (MCU) with picoPower® technology. It combines 32kB ISP Flash memory with read-while-write capabilities, 1kB EEPROM, 2kB SRAM, 27 general purpose I/O lines, 32 general purpose working registers, five flexible timer/counters with compare modes, internal and external interrupts, two USARTs with wake-up on start of transmission, two byte-oriented 2-wire serial interfaces, two SPI serial ports, 8-channel 10-bit A/D converter, programmable watchdog timer with internal oscillator, a unique serial number and six software selectable power saving modes. The device operates between 1.8-5.5 volts."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press/201601/16-008E/">Sony Acquires Altair Semiconductor, Israeli Innovator of LTE Modem Chip Technology</a></p>

<p><img src="NS39_SonyAcquiresAltairSemiconducto.jpg" alt="NS39_SonyAcquiresAltairSemiconducto" /></p>

<p><em>"Sony Corporation is announcing that it has reached an agreement with Altair Semiconductor and its major shareholders to acquire the company. The purchase price is 212 million U.S. dollars (approximately 25 billion yen), and Sony expects to complete the acquisition in early February, 2016. Altair, an Israel-based company, owns modem chip technology and related software for LTE (Long Term Evolution), a 4G cellular standard for mobile devices. Altair develops and sells products focused on LTE technology, and its modem chips stand out for their low power consumption, high performance and competitive cost. "</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT39_TinyElectronicImplantsMonitorB.jpg" alt="CT39_TinyElectronicImplantsMonitorB" /></p>

<p><em>"A new class of small, thin electronic sensors can monitor temperature and pressure within the skull – crucial health parameters after a brain injury or surgery – then melt away when they are no longer needed, eliminating the need for additional surgery to remove the monitors and reducing the risk of infection and hemorrhage. Similar sensors can be adapted for postoperative monitoring in other body systems as well, the researchers say. Led by John A. Rogers, a professor of materials science and engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and Wilson Ray, a professor of neurological surgery at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, the researchers published their work in the journal Nature."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT39_PhysicsProfessorDavidHallAndTe.jpg" alt="CT39_PhysicsProfessorDavidHallAndTe" /></p>

<p><em>"Physicists have long predicted the possibility of tying knots in quantum fields. But no one has been able to make or observe a three-dimensional quantum knot, until now. In a breakthrough discovery explored in a paper published in Nature Physics, one of the most prestigious journals in physics, a scientific team led by Amherst Physics Professor David S. Hall ’91 and Aalto University (Finland) Professor Mikko Möttönen have found a way to create knotted solitary waves in a quantum-mechanical field. The discovery builds on their recent work on Dirac monopoles and isolated monopoles, and is yet another extraordinary step forward in understanding the nature of quantum fluids. The isolated monopole research in particular, Hall says, led to the quantum knot discovery."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT39_DesignerCrystalsForNextGenElec.jpg" alt="CT39_DesignerCrystalsForNextGenElec" /></p>

<p><em>"Liquid is often seen as the kryptonite of electronics, known for damaging and corroding components. That’s why a new process that uses vapour– rather than liquid – to grow designer crystals could lead to a new breed of faster, more powerful electronic devices. The method, invented by an international team of scientists from the University of Leuven in Belgium, the National University of Singapore and CSIRO has been published today in the journal Nature Materials. For the first time, the researchers have shown how the designer crystals known as ‘metal organic frameworks’ or MOFs, can be grown using a vapour method that is similar to steam hovering over a pot of hot water. The crystals are the world’s most porous materials, and if applied to microelectronic devices, could significantly boost their processing power. "</em></p></li>

</ul>

<p><em>"This instructional manual on the art of carpentry and joinery was originally published in 1905. It outlines the skills and basic knowledge necessary to become competent at woodwork, and includes chapters on 'Timber', 'Plane Geometry', 'Tools', 'Wooden Roofs', and much more. This is an excellent informative work, complete with many diagrams to aid understanding. Here is a short extract from the author's preface that explains his aims: 'The simplest types of construction have been dealt with most fully, and the principles they embody have been emphasised continually. Without going into great detail, these rules have then been applied to more complicated examples; for a long experience has convinced the author that a student who has grasped the fundamental facts of a subject requires a minimum of guidance in more advanced work.' A specially commissioned new introduction on the history and uses of woodwork has been added to the republication of this work."</em></p>

<p><em>"Welcome to the world of wireless know-how in the form of amateur or "ham" radio. Where else can you be an electronics and programming whiz, study solar and atmospheric phenomena, design your own communication system, and provide valuable public service — all at the same time? Amateur radio and the Nuts &amp; Volts readership have a lot in common. Let's get to know each other! I’m thrilled to help return ham radio to the pages of Nuts &amp; Volts! In every other issue, I’ll be discussing some aspect of ham radio technology that you can use on your workbench and in your projects — whether you have (or get!) a license or not. Over the years, NV has featured ham radio in articles and columns so ham radio was never truly absent. The magazine’s editor is a ham (NU1N) and Paul Verhage — maven of the high altitudes and Near Space columnist — is also known as KD4STH. Many of the authors hold an amateur “ticket,” so maybe they will share their call signs with us in future articles. You may be surprised at how widespread amateur radio really is!"</em></p>

<p><em>"This chair design is old. Some say it dates back to the the mid 1700's with Mountain Men roaming the US. Some call it a Viking chair and claim it is a Medieval design. For certain it popped up in Boy Scout camps in the US in the early 20th century. Leave a comment about the oldest you've seen!"</em></p>

<p><em>"The story of this motor shield is that I wanted to make a robot for my multifunctional brainwave controlled system and I decided to share this with you. It's a very simple circuit I used the L293D IC that is a dual bridge motor driver IC. I also added an output for a servo motor. Finally this circuit was able to control 2 DC motors or 1 stepper motor and a seerco motor."</em></p>

<p><img src="PM39_58GhzRx5808ModuleOpenSourceFpv.jpg" alt="PM39_58GhzRx5808ModuleOpenSourceFpv" /></p>

<p><em>"First-person view (FPV) is a method used to control a radio-controlled vehicle from the driver or pilot’s view point. Most commonly it is used to pilot a radio-controlled aircraft or other type of unmanned aerial vehicle (drone). The vehicle is either driven or piloted remotely from a first-person perspective via an onboard camera, fed wirelessly to video fpv goggles or monitor. At the price of 9 dollars the BOSCAM rx5808 receiver module is very popular in the FPV RX (receiver) builder scene.  By default it supports only 8 channels with dip switch. But by using it with SPI interface and Arduino with  rx5808-pro open source setup it becomes a comfortable deluxe RX with nice autoscan and a spectrum anlyser."</em></p>

Indeed, and awesome way to set up a charity and help the needed ones by installing it in shopping complexes and other public places (if a bigger version of the same is made). This was just a prototype to present the basic idea which when modified and used at a bigger level, can definitely help. The following project uses an arduino for all it's processing. The RGB LEDs installed inside the box keep on flashing and changing colors which can attract much attention. When a person donates a coin, the ultrasonic sensor installed just on the box detects that and the servo present at the top waves 2-3 times with a 'Thank You' message displayed. This feature can surely bring a smile on the person's face who just donated that coin! Using only arduino and some other basic parts, you can make this project within 3-4 hours max. without the need of hunting the parts. Although a bigger version of the same would be much better, but that doesn't mean that this small one is useless. Even this one can be put at various places."</em></p>

The pins on the 328, and all Atmel microcontrollers, are arranged in banks of eight. The "D" bank is available but you only have full access to the one bank. There are only six pins available on the "C" bank, the analog input pins, because one of them is not broken out and the other is the reset. Two of the pins on the "B" bank are taken up by the crystal. It is possible to run the chip without the crystal and have full access to all eight pins on the "B" bank. There is an internal R/C network that can be used to clock the chip. The chip will run at eight MHz instead of sixteen. This is usually not a problem because most Arduino programs do not need the speed anyway. Also the internal clock is not as accurate. The tolerance specified in the datasheet for the ATtiny85 is +/- ten percent while most crystals have a tolerance of 30 PPM. I would assume that the 328 is the same but I could not find it in the 328 datasheet. (The datasheet is hundreds of pages of very dry reading.)

And since they are readily available in the 14x50mm AA size, you can use cheap AA holders for them in electronics projects. When it comes to chargers, things can be a bit problematic.  LiFePO4 batteries should be charged to 3.6V, rather than 4.2V like regular lithium-ion batteries.
