<p>Esta semana a Google anunciou que o seu sistema de tradução suporta atualmente 103 línguas e traduz cerca de 140 mil milhões de palavras por dia. Com este nível de exigência a Google resolveu alterar o seu sistema passando a usar Inteligência Artificial e redes Neuronais para o seu sistema de tradução designando-o de "Google Neural Machine Translation" (GNMT). Num passo mais arrojado foi introduzido o Zero-Shot Translation (ZST) - este sistema vai permitir a tradução entre duas línguas para as quais não existe o sistema ainda não tem uma tradução direta. Ficámos igualmente a saber que a Microsoft está a fazer uma grande aposta nos sistemas quânticos apostando que será possível criar um computador quântico escalável usando o que é chamado de qubit topológico. Cientistas da ESA criaram uma impressora 3D capaz de imprimir camadas aditivas de metal em gravidade-zero. Este passo vem melhorar significativamente a capacidade de recriar peças metálicas que se danifiquem no espaço.
A ESA anunciou esta semana que o acidente com a sonda ExoMars Schiaparelli a 19 de Outubro se terá ficado a dever a um problema de saturação - medida máxima - da unidade de medida de inercia (IMU) que ocorreu momentos após a abertura do para-quedas. A IMU mede o rácio de rotação do veiculo. O seu 'output' era na generalidade o que era previsto excepto neste evento, que persistiu por cerca de 1 segundo mais do que o esperado.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como alguns modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis. Saiu a MagPI Nº 52 assim como o Raspberry PI PROJECTS BOOK 2.</p>

<p><em>"In the last 10 years, Google Translate has grown from supporting just a few languages to 103, translating over 140 billion words every day. To make this possible, we needed to build and maintain many different systems in order to translate between any two languages, incurring significant computational cost. With neural networks reforming many fields, we were convinced we could raise the translation quality further, but doing so would mean rethinking the technology behind Google Translate. In September, we announced that Google Translate is switching to a new system called Google Neural Machine Translation (GNMT), an end-to-end learning framework that learns from millions of examples, and provided significant improvements in translation quality. However, while switching to GNMT improved the quality for the languages we tested it on, scaling up to all the 103 supported languages presented a significant challenge."</em> <a href="https://research.googleblog.com/2016/11/zero-shot-translation-with-googles.html">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Good progress has been made in investigating the ExoMars Schiaparelli anomaly of 19 October. A large volume of data recovered from the Mars lander shows that the atmospheric entry and associated braking occurred exactly as expected. The parachute deployed normally at an altitude of 12 km and a speed of 1730 km/h. The vehicle’s heatshield, having served its purpose, was released at an altitude of 7.8 km. As Schiaparelli descended under its parachute, its radar Doppler altimeter functioned correctly and the measurements were included in the guidance, navigation and control system. However, saturation – maximum measurement – of the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) had occurred shortly after the parachute deployment. The IMU measures the rotation rates of the vehicle. Its output was generally as predicted except for this event, which persisted for about one second – longer than would be expected."</em> <a href="http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/ExoMars/Schiaparelli_landing_investigation_makes_progress">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"On the wall of Aaron Dollar 's office is a poster for R.U.R. (Rossum 's Universal Robots), the 1920 Czech play that gave us the word 'robot.' The story ends with the nominal robots seizing control of the factory of their origin and then wiping out nearly all of humanity. Dollar, fortunately, has something more cheerful in mind for the future of human-robot relations. He sees them as helpers in our daily lives   performing tasks like setting the table or assisting with the assembly of your new bookcase. But getting to the point where robots can work in the unstructured environment of our homes (as opposed to industrial settings) would take a major technological leap and a massive coordination of efforts from roboticists around the globe. The living room has been called the last frontier for robots   but first, the robotics community needs some standards that everyone can agree on."</em> <a href="http://news.yale.edu/2016/11/17/new-standard-robotics">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Controlling the flow of heat through semiconductor materials is an important challenge in developing smaller and faster computer chips, high-performance solar panels, and better lasers and biomedical devices. For the first time, an international team of scientists led by a researcher at the University of California, Riverside has modified the energy spectrum of acoustic phonons  elemental excitations, also referred to as quasi-particles, that spread heat through crystalline materials like a wave by confining them to nanometer-scale semiconductor structures.

<p><em>"The new nylon-based system, by contrast, uses cheap material and a simple manufacturing process, and demonstrates very good cycling longevity. It all comes down to how the nylon fibers are shaped. Some polymer fiber materials, including highly oriented nylon, have an unusual property: When heated, 'they shrink in length but expand in diameter,' Mirvakili says, and this property has been harnessed to make some linear actuator devices. But to turn that linear shrinking motion into bending typically requires a mechanism such as a pulley and a takeup reel, adding extra size, complexity, and expense. The MIT team 's advance was to directly harness the motion without requiring extra mechanical parts."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2016/nylon-muscle-fibers-1123">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Scientists at The University of Manchester have discovered a new method of creating optoelectronic circuits using graphene and other 2D materials that are much smaller than their current counterparts. Optoelectronics, the technology that uses pulses of light rather than traditional electrical signals, is vital for telecommunication networks. Modulators are important in optoelectronic circuits as they control the signals passed through optoelectronic devices. Previous attempts to create hybrid modulators incorporating graphene have yielded promising although limited results. Writing in Nature Communications, researchers led by Professor Sasha Grigorenko have shown it is possible to combine graphene, its sister material boron nitride and a nanoscale gold grating to create a new class of optical modulator. Graphene is the world 's first two-dimensional material, just one atom thick yet 200 times stronger than steel, more conductive than copper and impermeable to water."</em> <a href="http://www.graphene.manchester.ac.uk/latest/?archive=twelvemonths&amp;id=17498">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"The chassis is now a lot less bulky and consists of multiple parts, the pulleys move more easily now. Before printing everything it is best to print a couple chain links to see if they work. When using multiple links per step the chain link with the socket on top can be used to connect both the horizontal and vertical parts of one step, the link without the socket can be used in between. The pulley should be big enough that the chain with the mounted steps can bend around it, so it is best to print one of the pulleys next to try that out. The pulleys with the mounted chain are placed on the axes in a way that the hole in the chassis aligns with the square hole of one of the pulleys. Make sure the pulleys rotate easily. You will need 12 pins to assemble the chassis and mount the handle and stands. Inserting the pins can be quite tough, I did it carefully with pliers and a hammer. The crank can be joined with the handle and mounted trough the hole of the chassis with pins. The pictures should give a good overview how the parts connect together."</em> <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1911788">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Almost every project that I made in my life use arduino or just atmegas, but on last electronic lesson in my school I found small integrated circuit called 555. I have heard about it before but I was thinking that microcontrollers are better. I read something about 555 in the internet and I found that this is the most popular integreted circuit in the world! And I have never used it :( I thought that it can be nice to make something completely without any programing and just with basic electronic components. I started to think what can I do with 555, but couldn't find anything intresting. Than I talked with my friend about useless machines and I thought that I can make useless machine with 555, servo, some resistors and switch. And it will be very simple and I don't need microcontroller to make it! I order some 555 on the internet and thought that I can test my design in some simulator. In school we are using electrosym but it's very old and I don't like it. But I read about circuits.io and I thought I will try it, after testing everything I can say that this program is pretty good to start with, it's simple to use and very intuitive.

This sounds simple enough, except that the sun moves throughout the day. This is why there are now a number of different mechanisms which work on a range of principles with the purpose of aligning your panel or array of panels directly towards the sun, they are called solar trackers. There are two principle types of trackers, single and duel axis trackers. Single axis trackers are adjusted every month or so account for seasonal changes in the suns position, the single axis is then used to track the daily movement of the sun across the sky. Duel axis trackers eliminate the need for monthly adjustment by using one axis to track the suns daily movement and another axis to track the seasonal movement. A single axis solar tracker improves solar output by around 25% and a dual axis tracker by around 40% according to this article on Altestore."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Solar-Tracker-Single-or-Dual-Axis/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"In the past couple years, the ESP8266 platform has flourished dramatically and emerged as one of the most popular hardware tools among electronics hobbyists and IoT enthusiasts. Packed with a 32-bit RISC CPU running at 80 MHz, a fully integrated WiFi radio with TCP/IP protocol stack, serial peripherals (I2C, SPI, and UART), an ADC channel, and general purpose I/O pins, the ESP8266 is the most integrated and affordable WiFi solution available in the current IoT market space. An ESP8266 hardware, like NodeMCU and ESP-01, can directly interface with sensors using its peripherals and upload the sensor measurements to a local or a remote web server via internet. Right now, there are already quite a bit of cloud IoT platforms (ThingSpeak, thinger.io, TESPA.io, Xively, the list is getting bigger everyday) that provides APIs and tools to allow the ESP8266 users to directly upload their sensor readings online for real-time visualization and global access. If you are a regular user of Google Drive, like me, you would find a Google sheet more approachable than all those IoT cloud platforms. In this tutorial, I will describe a method of connecting the ESP8266 device directly to a Google sheet for storing the sensor data without using any third party plugin. For illustration, I am using a NodeMCU board that reads the analog output from a soil moisture sensor inserted into one my flower pots and directly connects to a spreadsheet on my Google Drive for storing the data."</em> <a href="http://embedded-lab.com/blog/post-data-google-sheets-using-esp8266/">[...]</a></p>

No handshaking, no interrupts, no polling. One advantage of such an approach, is that it could transfer data really quickly through DMA - without tying up the µC 's CPU at all. As it so happens, most STM32 chips with 100 pins or more include a 'Flexible Static Memory Controller' which can do just that. And in an earlier weblog post I already used DMA to pump data into the (built-in) D/A converter at 2.7 million samples per second."</em> <a href="http://jeelabs.org/2016/11/a-fast-%C2%B5c-to-fpga-bus/">[...]</a></p>
