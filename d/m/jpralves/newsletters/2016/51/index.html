<p><img src="CT51_PersonOnAChipuOfTBiomedicalEng.jpg" alt="CT51_PersonOnAChipuOfTBiomedicalEng" /></p>

<p><em>"Researchers at the U of T Institute of Biomaterials &amp; Biomedical Engineering (IBBME) have developed a new way of growing realistic human tissues outside the body. Their “person-on-a-chip” technology, called AngioChip, is a powerful platform for discovering and testing new drugs, and could eventually be used to repair or replace damaged organs. Professor Milica Radisic, graduate student Boyang Zhang and their collaborators are among those research groups around the world racing to find ways to grow human tissues in the lab, under conditions that mimic a real person’s body. They have developed unique methods for manufacturing small, intricate scaffolds for individual cells to grow on. These artificial environments produce cells and tissues that resemble the real thing more closely than those grown lying flat in a petri dish."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://news.berkeley.edu/2016/03/11/magnetic-chips-low-power-computing/">Experiments show magnetic chips could dramatically increase computing’s energy efficiency</a></p>

<p><img src="CT51_ExperimentsShowMagneticChipsCo.jpg" alt="CT51_ExperimentsShowMagneticChipsCo" /></p>

<p><em>"In a breakthrough for energy-efficient computing, UC Berkeley engineers have shown for the first time that magnetic chips can actually operate at the lowest fundamental energy dissipation theoretically possible under the laws of thermodynamics. The findings, published today in the peer-reviewed journal Science Advances, mean that dramatic reductions in power consumption are possible — down to as little as one-millionth the amount of energy per operation used by transistors in modern computers. This is critical for mobile devices, which demand powerful processors that can run for a day or more on small, lightweight batteries. On a larger, industrial scale, as computing increasingly moves into “the cloud,” the electricity demands of the giant cloud data centers are multiplying, collectively taking an increasing share of the country’s — and world’s — electrical grid."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT51_TauCreatesCyborgCardiacPatchFo.jpg" alt="CT51_TauCreatesCyborgCardiacPatchFo" /></p>

<p><em>"Tel Aviv University researchers combine electronics with living tissues to create a self-regulating cardiac patch. More than 25% of the people on the national US waiting list for a heart will die before receiving one. Despite this discouraging figure, heart transplants are still on the rise. There just hasn't been an alternative. Until now. The "cyborg heart patch," a new engineering innovation from Tel Aviv University, may single-handedly change the field of cardiac research. The bionic heart patch combines organic and engineered parts. In fact, its capabilities surpass those of human tissue alone. The patch contracts and expands like human heart tissue but regulates itself like a machine."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.hrl.com/news/2016/0202/">HRL LABORATORIES' breakthrough may pave the way for gallium nitride to supplant silicon in integrated circuits</a></p>

<p><img src="CT51_HrlLaboratoriesBreakthroughMay.jpg" alt="CT51_HrlLaboratoriesBreakthroughMay" /></p>

<p><em>"Researchers at HRL Laboratories, LLC, have achieved the first demonstration of gallium nitride (GaN) complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) field-effect-transistor (FET) technology, and in doing so have established that the semiconductor’s superior transistor performance can be harnessed in an integrated circuit. This breakthrough paves the way for GaN to become the technology of choice for power  conversion circuits that are made in silicon today. According to HRL Senior Staff Research Engineer and Principal Investigator Dr. Rongming Chu, GaN transistors have long excelled in both power switching and microwave/millimeter wave applications, but their potential for integrated power conversion has been unrealized. "Unless the fast-switching GaN power transistor is intentionally slowed down in power circuits, chip-to-chip parasitic inductance causes voltage instabilities," he said."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT51_ArtificialLeafHarnessesSunligh.jpg" alt="CT51_ArtificialLeafHarnessesSunligh" /></p>

<p><em>"Generating and storing renewable energy, such as solar or wind power, is a key barrier to a clean-energy economy. When the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis (JCAP) was established at Caltech and its partnering institutions in 2010, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Energy Innovation Hub had one main goal: a cost-effective method of producing fuels using only sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide, mimicking the natural process of photosynthesis in plants and storing energy in the form of chemical fuels for use on demand. Over the past five years, researchers at JCAP have made major advances toward this goal, and they now report the development of the first complete, efficient, safe, integrated solar-driven system for splitting water to create hydrogen fuels."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT51_TheMultiferroicSandwich.jpg" alt="CT51_TheMultiferroicSandwich" /></p>

<p><em>"Two properties are particularly sought after in materials for technology (for a variety of devices from sensors to computer memory, etc.): magnetism and ferroelectricity. Obtaining materials with both qualities is highly desirable. At the present time, these properties have shown to be almost entirely mutually exclusive, but a new study conducted by SISSA/Northwestern University introduces an innovative method which may soon become reality.

<li><p><a href="http://www.itu.dk/people/sestoft/pebook/jonesgomardsestoft-a4.pdf">Partial Evaluation and Automatic Program Generation</a></p>

<p><em>"This book is about partial evaluation, a program optimization technique also known as program specialization. It presents general principles for constructing partial evaluators for a variety of programming languages; and it gives examples, applications, and numerous references to the literature."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://cnx.org/exports/bb821554-7f76-44b1-89e7-8a2a759d1347%405.2.pdf/high-performance-computing-5.2.pdf">High Performance Computing</a></p>

<p><em>"The purpose of this book, High Performance Computing has always been to teach new programmers and scientists about the basics of High Performance Computing. This book is for learners with a basic understanding of modern computer architecture, not advanced degrees in computer engineering, as it is an easily understood introduction and overview of the topic."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/Papers/phics.pdf">Philosophy of Computer Science</a></p>

<p><em>"This document is a continually-being-revised draft of a textbook on the philosophy of computer science. It is based on a course I created for the Department of Computer Science and Engineering and the Department of Philosophy at the State University of New York at Buffalo."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/julia/latest/julia.pdf">Julia Language Documentation</a></p>

<p><em>"Scientific computing has traditionally required the highest performance, yet domain experts have largely moved to slower dynamic languages for daily work. We believe there are many good reasons to prefer dynamic languages for these applications, and we do not expect their use to diminish. Fortunately, modern language design and compiler techniques make it possible to mostly eliminate the performance trade-off and provide a single environment productive enough for prototyping and efficient enough for deploying performance-intensive applications. The Julia programming language fills this role: it is a flexible dynamic language, appropriate for scientific and numerical computing, with performance comparable to traditional statically-typed languages."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ktbz9fy7qbwsyfa/www.dedoimedo.com-crash-book.pdf">Linux Kernel Crash Book</a></p>

<p><em>"Writing books is not a new experience for me. I've been doing it since the age of 10. Most of these books gather proverbial dust on this or that hard disk, others are being pampered for limelight, others yet have been abandoned. There's no better place to announce the demise of one project as at the birth of another. As you may have guessed, my super-extensive mother-of-all Linux topics book is not going to be published any time soon, as simple system administration no longer excites me. The single Apache chapter remains a proof-of-concept poetic demonstration, an orphan of what might have been."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="PM51_BurglarAlarmSystem.jpg" alt="PM51_BurglarAlarmSystem" /></p>

<p><em>"I had a "brand name" burglar alarm system installed in this house many years ago, but when I switched my phone system to use VOIP over my internet, the phone connection to the alarm system was disconnected and it was too much bother to re-route the phone system to accomodate the alarm system. In addition, I wasn't too wild about the $30/month monitoring fee, and also the fact that the system relied on the phone system. Wouldn't an internet enabled alarm be "better"? It could text me, email me, and be easier to control. Time to whip out another Arduino."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="PM51_GettingStartedWithAtmelAttiny1.jpg" alt="PM51_GettingStartedWithAtmelAttiny1" /></p>

<p><em>"I like Atmel tinyAVRs because they are tiny computers that I can (almost) wrap my head around. The Atmel ATtiny4/5/9/10 are the cheapest in the tinyAVR line, and they come in two packages - SOT23 pictured above, and an even more stupendously small 2mm x 2mm USON package. This article will talk about programming these little chips. Though they may be tiny, they are still quite capable, and the right choice for many projects."</em></p></li>
