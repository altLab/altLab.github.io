<p>Esta semana a SpaceX estava a preparar mais um lançamento e o foguetão Facon 9 explodiu a dias do lançamento destruindo o satélite do Facebook internet.org. A universidade de Princeton apresentou um novo desenho de computador que irá permitir acelerar o desempenho dos Data Centers. O Chip designado por "Piton" tem 25 cores e ocupa um espaço de 6 x 6 milímetros tendo cerca de 460 milhões de transístores. A Intel anunciou a 7ª geração dos seus Cores. Esta, baseada na tecnologia de 14nm, aumenta o desempenho destes processadores e introduz um novo motor de multimédia que permite o processamento de conteúdos 4K UHD. Por fim, foi anunciado o suporte oficial de Docker para o Raspberry Pi. A imagem do Raspbian Jessie foi oficialmente acrescentada e é possível neste momento usar o Raspberry Pi para correr este tipo de contentores.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como alguns modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S47/19/67G69/index.xml">New microchip demonstrates efficiency and scalable design</a></h2>

<p><em>"Princeton University researchers have developed a new computer chip that promises to boost the performance of data centers that lie at the core of numerous online services such as email and social media. The chip  called "Piton" after the metal spikes driven by rock climbers into mountainsides to aid in their ascent  was presented Aug. 23 at Hot Chips, a symposium on high-performance chips held in Cupertino, California. Data centers  essentially giant warehouses packed with computer servers  support cloud-based services such as Gmail and Facebook, as well as store the staggeringly voluminous content available via the internet. Yet the computer chips at the heart of the biggest servers that route and process information often differ little from the chips in smaller servers or everyday personal computers."</em> <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S47/19/67G69/index.xml">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"If youre not already familiar with Docker, its a method of packaging software to include not only your code, but also other components such as a full file system, system tools, services, and libraries. You can then run the software on multiple machines without a lot of setup. Docker calls these packages containers. Think of it like a shipping container and youve got some idea of how it works. Shipping containers are a standard size so that they can be moved around at ports, and shipped via sea or land. They can also contain almost anything. Docker containers can hold your softwares code and its dependencies, so that it can easily run on many different machines. Developers often use them to create a web application server that runs on their own machine for development, and is then pushed to the cloud for the public to use."</em> <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/docker-comes-to-raspberry-pi/">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="http://news.mit.edu/2016/new-method-producing-some-metals-0824">New method developed for producing some metals</a></h2>

<p><em>"The MIT researchers were trying to develop a new battery, but it didnt work out that way. Instead, thanks to an unexpected finding in their lab tests, what they discovered was a whole new way of producing the metal antimony  and potentially a new way of smelting other metals, as well. The discovery could lead to metal-production systems that are much less expensive and that virtually eliminate the greenhouse gas emissions associated with most traditional metal smelting. Although antimony itself is not a widely used metal, the same principles may also be applied to producing much more abundant and economically important metals such as copper and nickel, the researchers say. The surprising finding is reported this week in the journal Nature Communications, in a paper by Donald Sadoway, the John F. Elliott Professor of Materials Chemistry; postdoc Huayi Yin; and visiting scholar Brice Chung."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2016/new-method-producing-some-metals-0824">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Ultrasound imaging is used around the world to help visualize developing babies and diagnose disease. Sound waves bounce off the tissues, revealing their different densities and shapes. The next step in ultrasound technology is to image not just anatomy, but specific cells and molecules deeper in the body, such as those associated with tumors or bacteria in our gut. A new study from Caltech outlines how protein engineering techniques might help achieve this milestone. The researchers engineered protein-shelled nanostructures called gas vesicleswhich reflect sound wavesto exhibit new properties useful for ultrasound technologies. In the future, these gas vesicles could be administered to a patient to visualize tissues of interest. The modified gas vesicles were shown to: give off more distinct signals, making them easier to image; target specific cell types; and help create color ultrasound images."</em> <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/news/designing-ultrasound-tools-lego-proteins-51834">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Among the top puzzles in the development of fusion energy is the best shape for the magnetic facility  or bottle  that will provide the next steps in the development of fusion reactors. Leading candidates include spherical tokamaks, compact machines that are shaped like cored apples, compared with the doughnut-like shape of conventional tokamaks.  The spherical design produces high-pressure plasmas  essential ingredients for fusion reactions  with relatively low and cost-effective magnetic fields. A possible next step is a device called a Fusion Nuclear Science Facility (FNSF) that could develop the materials and components for a fusion reactor. Such a device could precede a pilot plant that would demonstrate the ability to produce net energy."</em> <a href="http://www.pppl.gov/news/2016/08/major-next-steps-fusion-energy-based-spherical-tokamak-design">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/ARCade-Reactor-RetroPie-Gaming-and-Media-System/">ARCade Reactor - RetroPie Gaming and Media System</a></h2>

<p><em>"As a young boy I grew up playing some of the classic computers like the BBC, Atari ST and the Amiga 500, later moving onto consoles like the SNES and the PlayStation. While the modern generation of gaming consoles and high-end PC's provide a graphically rich experience, there is a charm about the older games that you don't tend to get these days. Maybe it's just nostalgia, but they offer something that is often forgotten in the current generation.. games built purely around gameplay! Some of the older games can be so much fun and so immersive to play, the visuals become secondary to the whole experience. Wanting to find out if my fond memories of classic games were nothing more than rose tinted nostalgia or if they really were that awesome, I decided to build a Retro gaming console and revisit the past. I wasn't stopping there though, this is not only a Retro gaming system but also a Media player. To keep things as cheap, simple and as light-weight as possible I opted to build it with Raspberry Pi using RetroPie, Emulation Station and Kodi. The whole thing is enclosed in one of the most iconic games consoles of all time, Nintendo's Entertainment System (NES). To put a little extra polish and shine on the overall look I decided to paint the enclosure in the colour scheme of the Marvel Comic Hero Iron Man, this lead to the system being dubbed the ARCade Reactor(did you see what I did there?). As an added bonus the system also supports the use of original NES controllers, this adds a real sense of authenticity to the whole retro gaming thing."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/ARCade-Reactor-RetroPie-Gaming-and-Media-System/">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="http://www.righto.com/2016/08/the-beaglebones-io-pins-inside-software.html">The BeagleBone's I/O pins: inside the software stack that makes them work</a></h2>

<p><em>"The BeagleBone is a inexpensive, credit-card sized computer with many I/O pins. These pins can be easily controlled from software, but it can be very mysterious what is really happening. To control a general purpose input/output (GPIO) pin, you simply write a character to a special file and the pin turns on or off. But how do these files control the hardware pins? In this article, I dig into the device drivers and hardware and explain exactly what happens behind the scenes. (Various web pages describe the GPIO pins, but if you just want a practical guide of how to use the GPIO pins, I recommend the detailed and informative book Exploring BeagleBone.) This article focuses on the BeagleBone Black, the popular new member of the BeagleBoard family. If you're familiar with the Arduino, the BeagleBone is much more complex; while the Arduino is a microcontroller, the BeagleBone is a full computer running Linux. If you need more than an Arduino can easily provide (more processing, Ethernet, WiFi), the BeagleBone may be a good choice."</em> <a href="http://www.righto.com/2016/08/the-beaglebones-io-pins-inside-software.html">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Arduino boards and compatible alternatives are really easy use and o powerful, capable of making countless applications, but they suffer from two strong limitations: the relatively small program memory and the limited number of available outputs, especially when coming to PWM signals. For example, the Arduino / Fishino ONE has only six PWM outputs and, unless you generate the related signals via software (with considerable processor load), you can control one driver only, i.e. a single RGBW power LED or alternatively six monochromatic LEDs. This limitation becomes painfully evident when you want to drive more than 6 servo-motors with a single board: moving a hexapod robot type, which requires 12 servomotors, is impossible. Digital inputs and outputs are limited too; always talking about Arduino boards, we have a total of 13 digital I / O and 6 analog inputs (those can also be used as digital). The total number can be judged as sufficient for many uses, but you have to consider that many of these are used by onboard devices or by expansion shields. In practice, if you make a project with an Ethernet/WiFi shield, a SD memory, a serial port and some analog inputs, you have only six digital I / O left, that are often insufficient to medium complexity projects. For all these reasons we have decided to design an expansion shield, compatible with all Arduino boards and with our Fishino UNO (and Fishino Mega that well launch soon) that almost without consuming hardware resources provides 16 PWM outputs and 16 additional digital inputs/outputs. In addition, you can connect up to 8 shields, giving Arduino up to 128 PWM and I/Os, that can be managed in a total transparent way by the user through a specific library."</em> <a href="http://www.open-electronics.org/octopus-a-tentacular-shield-for-arduino-and-fishino/">[...]</a></p>

Making clap-on lights is easy with Arduino. What's more, it gives you the chance to make a simple project with a relay. Knowing how to incorporate relays into your projects opens up a whole new world of what you can do with your Arduino. Without going into too much detail, relays are electromechanical devices that allow you to use a relatively low amount of power (like the 5V from an Arduino pin) to control the switch of relatively high currents or voltages (lamps, motors, heaters, AC circuits, etc.). There are a number of different types of relays, but at their heart they all perform this function. The relay I used for this project is from Ebay(check here), I didn't know much about it besides it said that it could be used with Arduino (5V control) and it could handle up to 250VAC. Shop around, I got mine for under a dollar. My favorite thing about this project was how easy it was to use the relay."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Clap-On-Lights-Introduction-to-Relays/">[...]</a></p>

This chip provides 2x, 5x, 8x (and more) clock multiplication using an internal phased-lock loop (PLL). At less than a dollar on eBay, $1.55 on mouser, and $0.67 on Digikey, they dont break the bank and Im glad I have a few in my junk box! I have a 10MHz frequency standard which I want to use to measure some 1Hz (1pps) pulses with higher precision, so my general idea is to use a frequency multiplier circuit to increase the frequency (to 80 MHz) and use this to run a counter IC to measure the number of clock pulses between the PPS pulses. I spent a lot of time working with the CD4046 micro-power phased lock loop IC which has a phase comparator and a voltage controlled oscillator built in. It seemed this chip was the go-to for many years, but it requires external circuitry (ICs in my case) to divide by N and is intended to adjust a VCO output voltage based on the phase difference of two different inputs. Although I made some great progress using this chip, I found a few SMT ICS501 ICs in my junk box and decided to give them a try. I was impressed how easy it was to use! I just fed it 5V and my clock signal, and it output 8x my clock signal! Since I dont have my 10MHz reference frequency running at the moment, I tested it with a 1MHz canned oscillator. It worked great, and was so easy! Ill definitely be using this chip to multiply-up crystal oscillator frequencies to improve the precision of frequency counting."</em> <a href="http://www.swharden.com/wp/2016-08-31-ics501-simple-frequency-multiplier/">[...]</a></p>

The benefit of using an automatic watering system is that you avoid having your plants start to dry out, and you also wont accidentally soak your plants. The moisture is kept at the perfect level for your plants and you end up using less water! There's a lot of different automatic watering systems out there. These seem to work great however there has always been something preventing me from building them. They all require a pump. Personally I would prefer not to use a pump because I think they are expensive and makes a lot of noise. I went to the drawing board to see if I could come up with something different! This system uses a micro controller and soil sensor to monitor the water level of your plants. If your soil is starting to dry out the controller will counter this by watering the soil until it is sufficiently moist again. Instead of using a costly and noisy water pump, we are going to use a servo to elegantly open and crimp a water tube. So cheap.
