<p>No passado fim-de-semana decorreu o encontro de FabLabs nas instalações do fablab Lisboa. O altLab esteve presente e promoveu dois <em>workshops</em>. Foi anunciado neste evento que este ano a <a href="http://makerfairelisbon.com/">Lisbon Maker Faire</a> vai decorrer nos dias 25 e 26 de Junho. Já abriram as inscrições para os projetos.</p>

<p>Esta semana ficámos a saber que a Microsoft está a testar a montagem de datacenters debaixo de agua. O Luxemburgo prepara-se para lançar a base para a exploração e utilização de recursos espaciais. A Cisco anunciou a intenção de comprar a Jasper Technologies. Esta companhia é responsável por ajudar companhias a tirar partido da IoT numa escala global.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker e na rubrica "Documentação" apresentamos quatro livros (eBooks) que podem ser descarregados livremente e que esta semana são sobre Desenho de Compiladores, solução de problemas em Linux, Python para gerir a sua informação e um manual de Vi Improved - editor de ficheiros de UNIX. Também saiu esta semana o Nº 42 da Revista MagPI. Ainda na linha da documentação e por mais 12 dias vai estar disponível no "<a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/books/morebooks">Humble Book Bunble</a>" uma seleção de livros relacionados com 3D Printing &amp; Drones.</p>

<p><img src="NS40_MicrosoftResearchProjectPutsCl.jpg" alt="NS40_MicrosoftResearchProjectPutsCl" /></p>

<p><em>"In 2015, starfish, octopus, crabs and other Pacific Ocean life stumbled upon a temporary addition to the seafloor, more than half a mile from the shoreline: a 38,000-pound container. But in the ocean, 10 feet by 7 feet is quite small. The shrimp exploring the seafloor made more noise than the datacenter inside the container, which consumed computing power equivalent to 300 desktop PCs. But the knowledge gained from the three months this vessel was underwater could help make future datacenters more sustainable, while at the same time speeding data transmission and cloud deployment. And yes, maybe even someday, datacenters could become commonplace in seas around the world."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="NS40_LuxembourgToLaunchFrameworkToS.jpg" alt="NS40_LuxembourgToLaunchFrameworkToS" /></p>

<p><em>"The Luxembourg Government announced a series of measures to position Luxembourg as a European hub in the exploration and use of space resources. Amongst the key steps undertaken, as part of the spaceresources.lu initiative, will be the development of a legal and regulatory framework confirming certainty about the future ownership of minerals extracted in space from Near Earth Objects (NEO’s) such as asteroids. Luxembourg is the first European country to announce its intention to set out a formal legal framework which ensures that private operators working in space can be confident about their rights to the resources they extract, i.e. rare minerals from asteroids. Such a legal framework will be worked out in full consideration of international law. Luxembourg is eager to engage with other countries on this matter within a multilateral framework."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://newsroom.cisco.com/press-release-content?type=webcontent&amp;articleId=1741680">Cisco Announces Intent to Acquire Jasper Technologies, Inc.</a></p>

<p><img src="NS40_CiscoAnnouncesIntentToAcquireJ.jpg" alt="NS40_CiscoAnnouncesIntentToAcquireJ" /></p>

<p><em>"Cisco announced today its intent to acquire Jasper Technologies, Inc., a privately held company based in Santa Clara that delivers a cloud-based IoT service platform to help enterprises and service providers launch, manage and monetize IoT services on a global scale. Under the terms of the agreement, Cisco will pay $1.4 billion in cash and assumed equity awards, plus additional retention based incentives. Jasper is the industry’s leading IoT service platform in terms of number of enterprises and service providers; in fact, many of the world’s largest enterprises and service providers are using the Jasper platform to scale their IoT services business globally. With Jasper, companies can connect any device – from cars to jet engines to implanted pacemakers – over the cellular networks of the top global service providers, and then manage connectivity of IoT services through Jasper’s Software as a Service (SaaS) platform."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT40_IsraeliRobotCleaningSystemProm.jpg" alt="CT40_IsraeliRobotCleaningSystemProm" /></p>

<p><em>"Like the new site, most solar energy farms are located in deserts, where there is plenty of sunlight — which solar panels, of course, need a lot of. But the desert also has a lot of dust, which clogs up the photovoltaic components of the panels, making them less effective in collecting sunlight for conversion into energy. Panels have to be cleaned on a regular basis, but water in the desert tends to be expensive, if available at all — and the use of water to clean the panels raises the costs of production, making solar power too expensive to be considered anything more than a novelty."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"LaserPipe is a collaborative project with TWI Ltd, running from January to December 2015, as part of Innovate UK's competition for feasibility studies under the title: "Developing the civil nuclear supply chain". The project is looking into the feasibility of in-bore pipe welding using industrial high-powered lasers, coupled with snake-arm robotics for hazardous or confined space deployment."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT40_NewMicroscopeCreatesNearRealTi.jpg" alt="CT40_NewMicroscopeCreatesNearRealTi" /></p>

<p><em>"State-of-the-art atomic force microscopes (AFMs) are designed to capture images of structures as small as a fraction of a nanometer — a million times smaller than the width of a human hair. In recent years, AFMs have produced desktop-worthy close-ups of atom-sized structures, from single strands of DNA to individual hydrogen bonds between molecules. But scanning these images is a meticulous, time-consuming process. AFMs therefore have been used mostly to image static samples, as they are too slow to capture active, changing environments. Now engineers at MIT have designed an atomic force microscope that scans images 2,000 times faster than existing commercial models. With this new high-speed instrument, the team produced images of chemical processes taking place at the nanoscale, at a rate that is close to real-time video."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT40_AtTheEdgeOfAQuantumGas.jpg" alt="CT40_AtTheEdgeOfAQuantumGas" /></p>

<p><em>"JQI scientists have achieved a major milestone in simulating the dynamics of condensed-matter systems – such as the behavior of charged particles in semiconductors and other materials – through manipulation of carefully controlled quantum-mechanical models. Going beyond their pioneering experiments in 2009 (the creation of “artificial magnetism”), the team has created a model system in which electrically neutral atoms are coaxed into performing just as electrons arrayed in a two-dimensional sheet do when they are exposed to a strong magnetic field. The scientists then showed for the first time that it is possible to tune the model system such that the atoms (acting as electron surrogates) replicate the signature “edge state” behavior of real electrons in the quantum Hall effect (QHE), a phenomenon which forms the basis for the international standard of electrical resistance.* The researchers report their work in the 25 September issue of the journal Science."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"Introduction to Compiler Design is a textbook is intended for an introductory course on compiler design, suitable for use in an undergraduate programme in computer science or related fields. The book presents techniques for making realistic, though non-optimising compilers for simple programming languages using methods that are close to those used in "real" compilers, albeit slightly simplified in places for presentation purposes. All phases required for translating a high-level language to machine language is covered, including lexing, parsing, intermediate-code generation, machine-code generation and register allocation. Interpretation is covered briefly. The book aims to be neutral with respect to implementation languages, so algorithms are presented in pseudo-code rather than in any specific programming language, and suggestions for implementation in several different language flavours are in many cases given. The techniques are illustrated with examples and exercises."</em></p></li>

Includes a production-ready data collection script that can save you hours or days in debugging mission-critical Linux systems!"</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.pythonlearn.com/book_007.pdf">Python for Informatics: Exploring Information</a></p>

<p><em>"The goal of this book is to provide an Informatics-oriented introduction to programming. The primary difference between a computer science approach and the Informatics approach taken in this book is a greater focus on using Python to solve data analysis problems common in the world of Informatics."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/doc/book/vimbook-OPL.pdf">Vi iMproved - Vim</a></p>

<p><em>"Real Linux users don't use GUIs. No matter how popular, slick and sophisticated the interfaces become for Linux and UNIX, you'll always need to be able to navigate in a text editor. The vi editor is the original standard UNIX full screen editor. It's been around almost since UNIX began and it has changed very little. To get around the limitations of vi the people at Bram Moolenaar created the vim editor (the name stand for VI iMproved). It contains many more features than the old vi editor including: help, multiple windows, syntax highlighting, programmer support, and HTML support. All of the books published to date focus on vi alone not the expanded vim shipping with every major Linux distribution. In true New Riders' form, the vim reference will be a definitive, concise reference for the professional Linux user and developer."</em></p></li>

<h1 id="Modelos-3D">Modelos 3D <a href="#topo">^</a></h1>

<p>Com a disponibilidade de ferramentas que permitem dar azo a nossa imaginação na criação de peças 3D e espaços como o <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/">thingiverse</a> para as publicar, esta rubrica apresenta alguns modelos selecionados que poderão ser úteis.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1249221">3D-printed Watch with Tourbillon</a></h2>

<p><img src="MP40_3DPrintedWatchWithTourbillon.jpg" alt="MP40_3DPrintedWatchWithTourbillon" /></p>

<p>This is a mechanical watch with tourbillon driven by a 3d-printed mainspring. The watch has a Swiss lever escapement. The mainspring inside the going barrel keeps the watch running for approximately 30 Minutes. Accuracy is roughly one Second deviation within one Minute (depending on print-settings).</p>

<p>The project demonstrates that the 3D-printing technology is developing. Compared with earlier generations of 3d-printers, the process works more reliable and more accurately. However it's still a very advanced project, because printing inaccuracies need to be trimmed manually with some watchmaker skills, or the watch won't tick.</p>

<p>The watch is designed with Autodesk Fusion 360, and printed with Ultimaker 2.</p>

<p>Many thanks to Nicholas Manousos for his great article in HODINKEE explaining the importance of my project from a watchmakers perspective. His first 3d-printed Tourbillon 1000% was also a source of inspiration for my work.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:82620">Buckle Box, Printable In One Piece</a></h2>

<p><img src="MP40_BuckleBoxPrintableInOnePiece.jpg" alt="MP40_BuckleBoxPrintableInOnePiece" /></p>

<p>This is my second try at a one piece hinged box with latch. This latch is a little easier to operate than my box design I derived it from. For more information about this box, see the box it was derived from.</p>

<p>I like this latch design a lot. It locks the box closed very nicely and this version I printed as a test, has very nice tolerance at the hinge and at the latch. Now that the testing is over, I can design my real project.</p>

<p>UPDATE: v2 files now how a more tolerant latch. I realized that the tolerance for the latch was mistakenly coded to be half the tolerance of the hinge, since the hinge has slop tolerance for both the mail and female side. The latch should break free much easier on this version. Thanks everyone who printed it out or at least tried.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:139268">Fully assembled 3D printable wrench</a></h2>

<p><img src="MP40_FullyAssembled3DPrintableWrenc.jpg" alt="MP40_FullyAssembled3DPrintableWrenc" /></p>

<p>After watching the infamous video from a few years back where Z-Corp prints a fully working wrench i decided i wanted to do the same thing on my own printer.</p>

<p>Now, i am not talking about a "print-several-pieces-and-then-assemble" version which there are already a ton of on the internet.
What i wanted to do was something i could print and that would actually be fully working straight out of the printer.
I like to think i came pretty close. All you need to do is to remove the internal support and your done!</p>

<p>Keep in mind this is a proof of concept, i just wanted to see if i could do it.</p>

<p>Updated 2013-10-16: Added "Printable Wrench W Longer Screw" which has a longer "screw" (3mm).</p>

<p>Updated 2013-08-30: I have added two new files. One with a slightly bigger gap between moving parts. This one has 0,55mm gap instead of 0,35mm. Let me know if it works out (in particular with PLA). I have also added a STEP file with no support for anyone who maight want it.</p>

<p>Here is a short video: http://youtu.be/oMmsJVUAK3Q</p>

<p><img src="PM40_LedTestToolWithLcdDisplay.jpg" alt="PM40_LedTestToolWithLcdDisplay" /></p>

<p><em>"Most projects include at least one LED. Before soldering the LED, how can you determine if the color and brightness meets your needs? After that, how do you calculate the correct value resistor? Many years ago, I built a handy compact LED testing tool based on the LM317L adjustable current regulator. (You’ll definitely want to click on that link before continuing with this article.) It ended up being one of the most useful tools. In fact, the LED tester sits on a shelf above my keyboard, because I use the tester almost as often as I use my multimeter."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="PM40_BitsOfTime.jpg" alt="PM40_BitsOfTime" /></p>

<p><em>"The classic concept of an hourglass taken into the modern world of electronics. Like the original antetype the electronic hourglass is started by turning it upside down. A nifty simulation of the grains of sand visualises the lapse of time and reacts naturally on the turning of the hourglass. If time has elapsed an optical alarm is issued. Depending on your needs you can implement more specific actions like pulling the tea bag out of your cup. The electronic hourglass excels on its antetype in the ability to adjust the time in intervals of 15 seconds."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="PM40_WaterpiHouseplantRemoteWaterin.jpg" alt="PM40_WaterpiHouseplantRemoteWaterin" /></p>

<p><em>"The system is a suitable solution for people who love and want to look after plants in their house but very busy in daily jobs to do that. Growing plants requires time and effort in order to be successful because there are some regular things to do like watering them every day. People sometimes forget to take care of their plants. Also, some people travel a lot and spend less time in their house. In this context, they generally ask for help to look after their houseplants otherwise they simply give up to have them. WaterPi can help those people with doing regular things for plants. Also, because it can be controlled remotely, plant owners can interfere the watering process easily when needed."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"ESP8266 Analog Broadcast Television Interface. Hook an antenna up to GPIO3/RX, tune your analog TV to Channel 3. Power the ESP on! This uses the I2S Bus in the same way the esp8266ws2812i2s project works. Difference is it cranks the output baud to 80 MHz and codes bit patterns into that create effects at around 60 MHz. Please not that this project does not actually output video up at the 60 MHz purposefully. Instead it relies on secondary effects creating enough noise at the VHF Channel 3 mark to make it understandable by a TV."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"Today I am showing you how to make a very simple joule thief. A joule thief has many applications, the best gadget that I made with was a "Water Powered Lamp", soon I'm going to post on a guide about it but first I need to post this guide. I used an iPhone 4S as my camera :))) What Is A Joule Thief ? To simplify everything, a "joule thief" is a circuit that helps drive an LED light even though your power supply is low. What can we do with it? We can use it to squeeze the life out of our old, almost drained, non functioning batteries. This project can also be considered as a green and environmental experiment, we can also use it as a flashlight that can be ran by an old, weak, almost drained battery. I even tried to use my water powered battery from my previous instructable the "Water Powered Calculator", the project was featured and displayed in instructable's front page in the "Technologies" category."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"I have designed a few robots using the Arduino Uno and the Adafruit Motor Shield. Both are great for prototyping. But I found myself taking my robots apart every time I needed to build another robot. It's not cost effective to buy more Arduino microcontrollers and motor shields for every new robot project. So I decided to design a low cost "run-time" GOduino robot controller that combines the Arduino Uno functionality and, to some extent, the motor shield's. For this guide, I have used a breadboard but could have as well soldered the GOduino on a PCB."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="PM40_ArticlMsp432LaunchpadToTiGraph.jpg" alt="PM40_ArticlMsp432LaunchpadToTiGraph" /></p>

<p><em>"A few weeks ago, I received a pair of MSP432 Launchpad development boards courtesy of Texas Instruments, and two weeks ago, I began porting ArTICL to the MSP432. I'm happy to announce that ArTICL is now available to MSP432 Launchpad programs. First developed last year as an upgrade to my much-used but unpolished Arduino-TI calculator linking routines, ArTICL offers an easy interface to communicate between TI calculators and microcontroller development boards. ArTICL (which stands for Arduino TI Calculator Link) lets TI-83 Plus, TI-84 Plus, and other TI graphing calculators send and receive numbers, lists, strings, pictures, and other data types by making the Arduino or MSP432 emulate another calculator or a CBL2 device. ArTICL also includes five example programs that demonstrate how it can help graphing calculators interface with LEDs, sensors, motors, and more. Four of ArTICL's five demo programs have been made cross-compatible with the MSP432 Launchpad: ControlLED, Screenshot, ReadAnalog, and TypeLetter. ControlLED lets your calculator control the LEDs on the MSP432 Launchpad by sending a one-element list. Screenshot takes a screenshot of the calculator's screen when you press pushbutton P1.0 on the Launchpad, and dumps it as ASCII art to the Launchpad's serial interface. ReadAnalog returns the values of six analog pins on a scale from 0 to 1023 (0v to 3.3v). Finally, TypeLetter sends a remote keypress to the calculator twice a second, instructing it to type 'M' (or any other letter). "</em></p></li>

<p><em>"For this prototype I decided to stay with plain old through-hole packages and build the analog part in a modular way. The restriction to through-hole packages had a great influence of what parts I could use because most of the good stuff is in SMD these days. On the top I’ve used a XuLA-200 FPGA board. A really nice breakout for the Spartan 3A FPGA family. The analog part consists of (left to right): LT1227 current feedback OpAmp as the main SWP transceiver, good old LM311 as a one-bit A/D converter (to slow for high-speed SWP, but good enough up to 400 kbit/s). On the right there is a local power supply based around the LT1054 to generate the supply voltages for the OpAmp."</em></p></li>
