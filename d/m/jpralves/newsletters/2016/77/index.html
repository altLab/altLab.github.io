<p>Faz precisamente hoje 12 anos que foi lançada a primeira versão do Ubuntu. Designada por Ubuntu 4.10 (Warty Warthog), foi anunciada pela Canonical e pelo fundador do Ubuntu Mark Shuttleworth. Faz hoje também anos que nasceu <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Chadwick">James Chadwick</a>. É atribuída a este físico Inglês a descoberta em 1932 do neutrão. Ficou igualmente conhecido pelo seu contributo como responsável pela equipa Inglesa que trabalhou no projecto Manhattan durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial.
Nas noticias da semana ficámos a saber que os carros Tesla que saírem da fábrica a partir de hoje irão incorporar todo o hardware para o funcionamento do sistema de condução autónoma. Ficámos também a saber, através da fundação recentemente criada, que o mini computador MicroBit irá ser vendido em todo o mundo. Este mini-computador foi distribuído por todas as escolas inglesas para os alunos de 11 e 12 anos para os motivar para a programação. Ficámos hoje a saber que a sonda Schiaparelli teve problemas na aterragem em Marte porque os propulsores destinados a retardar a descida funcionaram menos tempo do que o necessário. As notícias não são famosas e os responsáveis das agências envolvidas ainda não conseguiram contactar a sonda depois deste acontecimento. A Samsung vai lançar Chips de memória de 8GB LPDDR4 DRAM. A NEC anunciou uma colaboração com a Fundação Raspberry Pi para integrar nas suas TV o Raspberry PI computing module. O Primeiro Vídeo Jogo foi feito à 58 anos - tratava-se de um jogo de Ténis para duas pessoas que usava um écran de um osciloscópio analógico.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como alguns modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis. Na rubrica "Documentação" apresentamos um livro sobre "Data Science" com Microsoft SQL Server 2016 e a MagPI edição especial de educação nº2.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-tesla-cars-being-produced-now-have-full-self-driving-hardware">All Tesla Cars Being Produced Now Have Full Self-Driving Hardware</a></h2>

<p><em>"Self-driving vehicles will play a crucial role in improving transportation safety and accelerating the worlds transition to a sustainable future. Full autonomy will enable a Tesla to be substantially safer than a human driver, lower the financial cost of transportation for those who own a car and provide low-cost on-demand mobility for those who do not. We are excited to announce that, as of today, all Tesla vehicles produced in our factory  including Model 3  will have the hardware needed for full self-driving capability at a safety level substantially greater than that of a human driver. Eight surround cameras provide 360 degree visibility around the car at up to 250 meters of range. Twelve updated ultrasonic sensors complement this vision, allowing for detection of both hard and soft objects at nearly twice the distance of the prior system. A forward-facing radar with enhanced processing provides additional data about the world on a redundant wavelength, capable of seeing through heavy rain, fog, dust and even the car ahead."</em> <a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-tesla-cars-being-produced-now-have-full-self-driving-hardware">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"The Micro Bit mini-computer is to be sold across the world and enthusiasts are to be offered blueprints showing how to build their own versions. The announcements were made by a new non-profit foundation that is taking over the educational project, formerly led by the BBC. About one million of the devices were given away free to UK-based schoolchildren earlier this year. The BBC says they encourage children, especially girls, to code. However, the delayed rollout of the machines to last year's Year 7s (11-to-12-year-olds) caused problems for teachers who had less time than expected to prepare related classes."</em> <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37682405">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Thrusters intended to slow a European lander as it neared Mars on Wednesday fired for less time than expected before contact with the vehicle was lost, leaving scientists uncertain whether it touched down safely or broke apart. The Schiaparelli probe, part of a broader mission to search for evidence of life on the Red Planet, was to test technologies during the descent and on the surface for a rover scientists hope to send to Mars in 2020. Its descent marked only the second European attempt to land a craft on Mars, but it has shown no signs of life since it stopped transmitting around 50 seconds before Wednesday's planned touchdown."</em> <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-europe-space-mars-idUKKCN12I2SW">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Developing invisible implantable medical sensor arrays, a team of University of WisconsinMadison engineers has overcome a major technological hurdle in researchers efforts to understand the brain. The team described its technology, which has applications in fields ranging from neuroscience to cardiac care and even contact lenses, in the Oct. 20 issue of the online journal Nature Communications. Neural researchers study, monitor or stimulate the brain using imaging techniques in conjunction with implantable sensors that allow them to continuously capture and associate fleeting brain signals with the brain activity they can see. However, its difficult to see brain activity when there are sensors blocking the view."</em> <a href="http://news.wisc.edu/see-through-sensors-open-new-window-into-the-brain/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Less than a micrometre thin, flexible and giving all the colours that a regular LED display does, it still needs ten times less energy than a Kindle tablet. Researchers at Chalmers University of Technology have developed the basis for a new electronic paper. Their results were recently published in the high impact journal Advanced Materials. When Andreas Dahlin, Assistant Professor at Chalmers University of Technology, and his PhD student Kunli Xiong were working on placing conductive polymers on nanostructures they discovered that the combination would be perfectly suited to creating electronic displays as thin as paper. A year later the results were ready for publication. A material that is less than a micrometre thin, flexible and giving all the colours that a standard LED display does while needing ten times less energy than a Kindle tablet."</em> <a href="http://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/chem/news/Pages/Bendable-electronic-paper-shows-full-colour-scale-.aspx">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"As I did not find a cable chain suiting my needs, I decided to make my own. I was looking for a fully parametric cable chain, capable of output in CSG. The Cable Chains I found here were mostly only .stl Surfaces. Also I wanted to be able to build not only a single Chainlink, but a complete cable chain. Here you can specify a vector consisting of the angles towards the previous chain links. In future the will be an additional option to differing link types, to restrict angular movement of the chain. The Cable Chain is generated though a nested vector. There is a tupel consisting of the chain link type (at the moment there are only type 1: restricted to 45 movement and type 2: +-45 movement, type 3 generates a nice looking closed but mechanically not necessarily reasonable closed chain, type 4 onwards is just the same as type 3) and the angle of this link towards the previous. e.g. [1,30] is a link with a 30 angle."</em> <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1078216">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"I built a system to control the fermentation temperature of my brew (beer, wine, whisky) by circulating hot or cold water through the fermentation vessel by means of a heat exchanger (a stainless steel wort chiller) which is located inside the fermentation vessel. The temperature is controlled by an Arduino controller, which controls (1) the heating elements of an electric kettle (2) a compressor's cooling coils that were retrofitted into the electric kettle and (3) a pump also located inside the kettle. Digital thermometers signal the arduino which activates the kettle, compressor and pump via a Relay Switch therefore allowing for full temperature control of your fermentor. The aim was to build a system that can control the temperature on a large fermentor that will not fit inside a refrigerator. Here, I demonstrate fermentation with a standard 23 liter plastic bucket fermenter but I plan to use my 70 liter brew pot in the future as the fermentor (the wort chiller will be retrofitted into the lid and silicon tubing will be used as a gasket clamped down with locking pliers)."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Dr-Fermentor-V9-Cooling-and-Heating-Fermentation-b/">[...]</a></p>

The basis for this is a low-power buck on the basis of a Texas TPS62120 where the microcontroller can switch the output voltage between 2.2 and 3.3 volts nominally. This works as intended. With no load and the output voltage low, the supply consumes 12.9 microamps at 12V input voltage. With the high output voltage the idle current goes up to 14.3uA. Quite a bit of that current is due to the voltage divider that sets the output voltage.

I will not be going into much detail regarding ESR or Equivalent Series Resistance Meters as, there is already plenty of other sources of information on the subject. Yet, every tinkering  knows capacitors are guilty of a lot of sins in electronics. Capacitors love to throw red herrings! They can appear physically fine (no bulge), show good capacitance and hide in circuit, standing to attention like the Queens Guards hiding shorts and high resistance under their big hats. This is where the  ESR tester can be a saviour, with the ability to test for "out of specification" high resistance, within the capacitor. They can also be used to test "in circuit", without the need to remove every capacitor in the circuit."</em> <a href="https://runawaybrainz.blogspot.com/2014/03/dr-browns-capacitor-esr-tester.html">[...]</a></p>
