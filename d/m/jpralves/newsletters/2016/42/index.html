<p><img src="NS42_MplabXpressCloudBasedIde.jpg" alt="NS42_MplabXpressCloudBasedIde" /></p>

<p><em>"MPLAB Xpress Cloud-Based IDE is an online development environment that contains the most popular features of our award-winning MPLAB X IDE. This simplified &amp; distilled application is a faithful reproduction of our desktop-based program, which allows users to easily transition between the two environments."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="NS42_ArmCortexR8ProcessorTrailBlaze.jpg" alt="NS42_ArmCortexR8ProcessorTrailBlaze" /></p>

<p><em>"The new ARM Cortex-R8 processor will enable chip designers to double the performance of ARM-based modem and mass storage device SoCs. ARM's latest real-time CPU offers the low latency, high performance and power efficiency demanded by future 5G modems and mass storage devices. The processor is available for licensing now and silicon is expected in 2016. A quad-core configuration dramatically boosts the total Cortex-R8 performance, which when combined with its real time features and extended low-latency memory makes Cortex-R8 the highest performing processor in its class."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="NS42_SamsungAdvancesOpenIotEcosyste.jpg" alt="NS42_SamsungAdvancesOpenIotEcosyste" /></p>

<p><em>"Samsung Electronics announced significant momentum for the SAMSUNG ARTIK™ IoT platform. The company announced that the SAMSUNG ARTIK platform is commercially available – a big step forward in bringing the Internet of Things (IoT) to everyday life. SAMSUNG ARTIK development kits can be ordered from Samsung’s channel partner Digi-Key Electronics starting February 22.

<p><img src="NS42_GoogleCloudVisionApiEntersBeta.jpg" alt="NS42_GoogleCloudVisionApiEntersBeta" /></p>

<p><em>"Today, we're announcing the beta release of Google Cloud Vision API. Now anyone can submit their images to the Cloud Vision API to understand the contents of those images — from detecting everyday objects (for example, “sports car,” “sushi,” or “eagle”) to reading text within the image or identifying product logos. With the beta release of Cloud Vision API, you can access the API with location of images stored in Google Cloud Storage, along with existing support of embedding an image as part of the API request. We’re also announcing pricing for Cloud Vision API and added additional capabilities to identify the dominant color of an image. For example, you can now apply Label Detection on an image for as little as $2 per 1,000 images or Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for $0.60 for 1,000 images. Pricing will be effective, starting March 1st."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT42_FirstAllAntiferromagneticMemor.jpg" alt="CT42_FirstAllAntiferromagneticMemor" /></p>

<p><em>"If you haven’t already heard of antiferromagnetic spintronics it won’t be long before you do. This relatively unused class of magnetic materials could be about to transform our digital lives. They have the potential to make our devices smaller, faster, more robust and increase their energy efficiency. Physicists at The University of Nottingham, working in collaboration with researchers in the Czech Republic, Germany and Poland, and Hitachi Europe, have published (14:00 EST Thursday January 14 2016) new research in the prestigious academic journal Science which shows how the ‘magnetic spins’ of these antiferromagnets can be controlled to make a completely different form of digital memory."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT42_RecoveryAndReproductionOfAnAnt.jpg" alt="CT42_RecoveryAndReproductionOfAnAnt" /></p>

<p><em>"Long-term survival has been one of the most studied of the extraordinary physiological characteristics of cryptobiosis in micrometazoans such as nematodes, tardigrades and rotifers. In the available studies of long-term survival of micrometazoans, instances of survival have been the primary observation, and recovery conditions of animals or subsequent reproduction are generally not reported. We therefore documented recovery conditions and reproduction immediately following revival of tardigrades retrieved from a frozen moss sample collected in Antarctica in 1983 and stored at -20 °C for 30.5 years. We recorded recovery of two individuals and development of a separate egg of the Antarctic tardigrade, Acutuncus antarcticus, providing the longest records of survival for tardigrades as animals or eggs. One of the two resuscitated individuals and the hatchling successfully reproduced repeatedly after their recovery from long-term cryptobiosis. This considerable extension of the known length of long-term survival of tardigrades recorded in our study is interpreted as being associated with the minimum oxidative damage likely to have resulted from storage under stable frozen conditions. The long recovery times of the revived tardigrades observed is suggestive of the requirement for repair of damage accrued over 30 years of cryptobiosis. Further more detailed studies will improve understanding of mechanisms and conditions underlying the long-term survival of cryptobiotic organisms."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT42_LaserNeuronWithGraphene.jpg" alt="CT42_LaserNeuronWithGraphene" /></p>

<p><em>"Bhavin Shastri, a Banting postdoctoral fellow in our group, has recently conducted research in using graphene as a saturable absorber element in neuron-inspired laser processors. Novel materials and devices in photonics have the potential to revolutionize optical information processing, beyond conventional binary-logic approaches. Laser systems offer a rich repertoire of useful dynamical behaviors, including the excitable dynamics also found in the time-resolved “spiking” of neurons. Spiking reconciles the expressiveness and efficiency of analog processing with the robustness and scalability of digital processing. We demonstrate a unified platform for spike processing with a graphene-coupled laser system. We show that this platform can simultaneously exhibit logic-level restoration, cascadability and input-output isolation—fundamental challenges in optical information processing. We also implement low-level spike-processing tasks that are critical for higher level processing: temporal pattern detection and stable recurrent memory. We study these properties in the context of a fiber laser system and also propose and simulate an analogous integrated device. The addition of graphene leads to a number of advantages which stem from its unique properties, including high absorption and fast carrier relaxation. These could lead to significant speed and efficiency improvements in unconventional laser processing devices, and ongoing research on graphene microfabrication promises compatibility with integrated laser platforms."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2016/january/3d-printer.html">It’s a 3D printer, but not as we know it</a></p>

<p><img src="CT42_ItsA3DPrinterButNotAsWeKnowIt.jpg" alt="CT42_ItsA3DPrinterButNotAsWeKnowIt" /></p>

<p><em>"3D printing techniques have quickly become some of the most widely used tools to rapidly design and build new components. A team of engineers at the University of Bristol has developed a new type of 3D printing that can print composite materials, which are used in many high performance products such as tennis rackets, golf clubs and aeroplanes. This technology will soon enable a much greater range of things to be 3D printed at home and at low-cost."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT42_BionicEyeReturnsSightToTheBlin.jpg" alt="CT42_BionicEyeReturnsSightToTheBlin" /></p>

<p><em>"What if you could cure blindness as easily as turning on the lights? That’s what one doctor and his team are hoping to achieve with a clinical trial that uses a new form of retina implant to return sight to patients who have  lost the ability to see. And for one of the six patients, it’s been a pretty incredible journey. Rhian Lewis was just a toddler when her parents noticed she had trouble seeing in the dark. Doctors discovered Lewis suffered from Retinitis Pigmentosa, a degenerative disease that would ultimately cause her to completely lose sight in her right eye, and most of it in her left. For the last 16 years, Lewis has been mostly blind."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT42_UclaScientistsCreateGrapheneBa.jpg" alt="CT42_UclaScientistsCreateGrapheneBa" /></p>

<p><em>"Gardeners often use sheets of plastic with strategically placed holes to allow their plants to grow but keep weeds from taking root. Scientists from UCLA’s California NanoSystems Institute have found that the same basic approach is an effective way to place molecules in the specific patterns they need within tiny nanoelectronic devices. The technique could be useful in creating sensors that are small enough to record brain signals."</em></p></li>

<p>Com a disponibilidade de ferramentas que permitem dar azo a nossa imaginação na criação de peças 3D e espaços como o <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/">thingiverse</a> para as publicar, esta rubrica apresenta alguns modelos selecionados que poderão ser úteis.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1351565">Parametric Battery Pack Holder</a></h2>

<p><img src="MP42_ParametricBatteryPackHolder.jpg" alt="MP42_ParametricBatteryPackHolder" /></p>

<p>I made this design to be able to pack 18650 Li-ion batteries together for use in DIY projects. It was designed for 18650 type batteries but it will work with different battery sizes (as long as they are cylinders).</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5654">RepKey</a></h2>

<p><img src="MP42_Repkey.jpg" alt="MP42_Repkey" /></p>

<p>Here is my replicate-able key/wrench that I use to build my RepRap Prusa Mendel at the moment. It takes standard hex bits and has also got a M8 nut wrench in the center. It can take pretty much load, that depends on how well your print went.
Mine is printed on the UP! 3d printer.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:664769">Vise for Holding a PCB (or other lightweight items)</a></h2>

<p><img src="MP42_ViseForHoldingAPcbOrOtherLight.jpg" alt="MP42_ViseForHoldingAPcbOrOtherLight" /></p>

<p>This thing is a vise that I made to hold a PCB while soldering. It will also accomodate other light weight items. The working space between the jaws is 100mm. There are tabs on the jaws to allow the vise to be secured to a table (a little masking tape also works).</p>

<p>It requires a 5mm diameter threaded steel rod of about 200mm in length with two or three washers, two normal nuts, and a locking nut to match.</p>

<p>Print the handle, left and right sides, and two backbones. I printed with a layer of .36 and a fill of .25. Assemble gluing the backbones into the left (stationary) side. Locking nut in handle. Two washers between handle and left jaw. One washer (small one) and two nuts on other side of left jaw from handle with second nut locking the pair in place on the threaded rod. Final nut on outside of right (moving) jaw in recess built for it. The nuts that fit into recesses should stay put based on friction but if not use some epoxy!</p>

<p>This is version two of what was originally uploaded. There is now a recess in the left handle for the two locking bolts. This allows the vise to close completely. There is also a second handle now included. This handle has a ball and joint feature that should allow the grip to rotate as it is turned. This does require some degree of printer precision. I would recommend printing it with a layer height of .3 or less. You may have to use some amount of force, and a pair of pliers or visegrips, to break loose any adhesion.</p>

<p>I print everything in PLA and was concerned that melting might be an issue but in practice, have so far (but without a lot of work yet), not found this to be the case. If you have heated up the PCB enough to cause an issue with the PLA you are probably getting it too hot. If this is an issue for you I would recommend printing in ABS. An alternative might be to shield the jaws with some foil to disperse heat.</p>

</ul>

<p>A placa analisada contém adicionalmente um conector USB, diversos LEDs (energia, estado e programável), um botão programável e um botão de <em>Reset</em>, um KitProg para a programação e debugging.</p>

<p>Em termos de custo a placa custa cerca de 9€.</p>

<h2>Programação da placa</h2>

<p>Para se utilizar esta placa deverá ser instalado o PSoC Creator - Ambiente IDE de programação deste tipo de processadores. Pode ser descarregado <a href="http://www.cypress.com/products/psoc-creator-integrated-design-environment-ide">daqui</a>.</p>

<h2>Exemplo de código com "Template"</h2>

<p>Para explicar e termos uma base de partida para explorar estas placas tive o prazer de ter a colaboração do <a href="https://github.com/joaocarvalhoopen">João Nuno Carvalho</a> que fez um projeto tipo "template" para esta placa.</p>

<p>O Kit vem com 3 projetos de exemplo:
- Um exemplo de utilização do botão e do LED
- Um exemplo de utilização do ADC e da UART.
- Exemplo de utilização do HID USB.</p>

<p>E existe mais código de exemplo para o PSoC 5, no PSoc Creator <code>Menu-&gt;File-&gt;Code Example... filter by device family PSoC 5 LP</code>.</p>

<p>No entanto, para começar um novo projeto dá jeito ter um "template" que implemente algumas funcionalidades base.
O "template" feito tem as seguintes características:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A UART configurada e código para se poder enviar dados para o PC e receber comandos do PC, já com os pinos configurados P12[6]e P12[7]. Isto dá muito jeito em debug, apesar deste KIT ter um debugger. Os pinos já se encontram ligados à porta USB física por isso não é necessário fazer qualquer ligação.</p></li>
<li><p>Ter o botão da placa do kit já mapeado para um pino (em modo pullup resistivo), com código para enviar o estado do pino para o PC por UART.</p></li>
<li><p>Ter o LED azul mapeado para um pino de saída (modo strong), mostrando o seu estado no PC e permitir que o mesmo seja alterado a partir do PC.</p></li>
<li><p>Ter o clock interno do chip a 3MHz (precisão máxima de +-1%) mas com a PLL configurada nos 70MHz para o relógio interno.</p></li>
<li><p>Ter uma folha de esquemático A3. (Podem ser adicionadas mais folhas).</p></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="GD42_PSoC_Creator_001.jpg" alt="GD42_PSoC_Creator_001" /></p>

<h3>Como utilizar o "template"</h3>

<ul>
<li>Descompactar o <a href="https://github.com/joaocarvalhoopen/Project_template_for_PSoC_5_LP_CY8CKIT-059_kit/blob/master/UART_001.zip">template.zip</a> para uma nova pasta</li>
<li>Abrir o PSoC Creator 3.3 ou superior</li>
<li>Mandar compilar (<code>Build</code>) do projecto para este Kit</li>
<li>Ligar o Kit através da porta USB</li>
</ul>

<p>Para se comunicar com a placa pode ser usada um programa como o <a href="../../2015/9/index.html#Open-Source">Putty</a> que permite usar a porta série. Deverão ser usados os seguintes parâmetros:</p>

<ul>
<li>baud rate: 115200bps</li>
<li>data bits: 8</li>
<li>parity: None</li>
<li>stop bits: 1</li>
<li>flow control: None</li>
</ul>

<p>Quando se carregar na tecla <code>M</code> irá aparecer um menu com os seguintes comandos:</p>

<p><img src="GD42_PuTTY_menu.jpg" alt="GD42_PuTTY_menu" /></p>

<p>Existem 3 contadores, um de 8 bits, um de 16 bits e um de 32 bits</p>

<h3>Como Usar o template para criar outros projectos</h3>

<p>Para usar este projecto como uma base para novo projeto chamado Test001, basta simplesmente fazer uma cópia do <em>workspace</em>  (a pasta onde o projeto está em) e alterar o nome do seu <em>workspace</em> no explorador. Abra o projeto e usar a opção do menu <code>Build-&gt; Clean ...</code>, para remover os ficheiros de compilação.</p>

<p>De seguida, abra o <em>workspace</em> no PSoC Creator 3.3 ou superior e com o botão direito do rato clique sobre o nome do <em>workspace</em> na árvore esquerda e mude o nome para o nome do <em>workspace</em>, clique com o botão direito no projeto para mudar o nome do projeto para o novo nome do projeto.</p>

<p>Mudar nome <em>workspace</em>:</p>

<p><img src="GD42_PSoC_Creator_002.jpg" alt="GD42_PSoC_Creator_002" /></p>

<p>Mudar nome do projecto:</p>

<p><img src="GD42_PSoC_Creator_003.jpg" alt="GD42_PSoC_Creator_003" /></p>

<p>Gravar todos os ficheiros.</p>

<p>Compilar (<code>Build</code>) o projecto no menu <code>Build-&gt;Clean and Build Test001...</code>
E agora apagar na pasta do projecto/<em>workspace</em> os seguintes ficheiros antigos:</p>

<ul>
<li>Test001\UART_001.cywrk.joao.nuno.carvalho</li>
<li>Test001\Test001.cydsn\UART_001.cycdx</li>
<li>Test001\Test001.cydsn\UART_001.cyfit</li>
<li>Test001\Test001.cydsn\UART_001.cyprj.joao.nuno.carvalho</li>
<li>Test001\Test001.cydsn\UART_001.rpt</li>
<li>Test001\Test001.cydsn\UART_001.svd</li>
<li>Test001\Test001.cydsn\UART_001_timing.html</li>
</ul>

<p>E está pronto.</p>

<p>Espero que este pequeno artigo tenha lançado alguma luz sobre este tipo de micro-controladores que é muito mais potente que se possa imaginar sendo que no entanto os primeiros passos são também eles mais complexos.</p>

Last option was quite interesting to me as this makes repairing stuff a lot easier when you know which part is defect instead of exchanging all part just by trial and error. The programmer did a quite good job (some IC were not recognized) until I had to upgrade to Win7. Here the programmer started to create troubles, the programmer was not recognized in some cases and the program froze during IC testing. After searching for alternatives I decided to make my own tester with some additional advantages. So the result was a Arduino based IC-tester with an optional Serial output which does the job in most cases (still some room for improvement available)."</em></p></li>
