<h2><a href="http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/atclen/news_en/15mk/091400828/">Nissan Considering Using AI to Design Cars</a></h2>

<p><em>"Nissan Motor Co Ltd started to consider designing cars by using artificial intelligence (AI). "We have once used AI to design a car," said Tetsurou Ueda of Nissan Research Center at a symposium that took place in Tokyo Aug 31, 2016. "Though it is still in the test phase, we feel that there is a possibility of commercialization." Similarities among cars are extracted by using AI to recognize many images. As a result, it becomes possible to crease "something like a car." In the experiment, the AI created "crushed" and "folded" cars in many cases, but it also output a car image that had never been seen in the past. For the future, Nissan plans to make improvements to the AI so that it can design specific types of cars such as sport cars, minivans, compact cars, etc. Though the AI does not replace designers at this point, it can stimulate the activities of designers, the company said."</em> <a href="http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/atclen/news_en/15mk/091400828/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Inspired by a Stratasys sample print, I decided to re-draw and improve the desktop, micro catapult. It can throw a small bit of paper, chunks of raft, and pretty much anything you can fit inside. Selected ammunition can be thrown around 2 metres, plenty to hit unaware victims at another desk! It's a Print-In-Place model, without the need for any support material. It also takes advantage of the material properties, meaning that there are no external parts or hardware, it's just the material that allows it to flex and store energy. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the ABS/PC I printed it in doesn't break or retain a memory from being fired over 100 times."</em> <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1763518">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:266956">Hinge Variations</a></h2>

<p><em>"Reusable parameterized hinges. The hinges are designed with an additive and a subtractive part, making it easy to combine with other design elements. This is the same hinge design I used on my Pop Box (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:248387). The file hingePairBase.scad is the main design file. All the other SCAD files are small variations from the base and are named with the parameter they tweak. Modify the SCAD to suit. When using the hinges, bear in mind that the hinge has a top and a bottom. Keep the plate material on the left to ensure that the subtractive parts are correctly oriented. For example, this means that if you were to lay the hinges around a polygon, one per side, you would need to make them go bottom to top in an anticlockwise direction to keep the polygon material on the left. The pin for the hinges is filament. Try various filaments you have to find which one works best for the inside diameter you print with. I find that my glow in the dark PLA fits well in a 2.06mm inside diameter hole, but red ABS needs to be sanded down slightly. The hinge sides with the lower hingelet count are made slighly larger than those with a higher hingelet count. This is make one side grip and one side rotate smoothly. I printed all of these in PLA at 0.2mm layer height on a Replicator 1."</em> <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:266956">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Since the start of getting going with esp8266 boards in late 2015 Ive had in the back of my mind the idea of how nice it would be to develop a little device that is free of all ties to a regular plug-in-the-wall power supply. With no plug in supply, were talking about battery power and if the goal of this project is complete independence then were talking rechargeable battery power. If this dream was a reality then the idea is that the device could go anywhere and be positioned anywhere, within WiFi range. I kept this idea bubbling in the background whilst building out other more general features of my custom web based ESP firmware and a few months ago I started gathering bits and pieces from aliexpress and eBay to form the basis of a prototyped custom rechargeable battery solar power supply."</em> <a href="https://jjssoftware.github.io/esp8266-configurable-power-management/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Hi there I've been here after a long time, and this time I've made a huge project as compared to my earlier ones. This is a full-sized 250 mm X 300 mm work area CNC machine and more interesting things is that it was made in 60$ only. I got some time in my summer vacations and this time I thought to make something apart from my daily work,I can say that it is a fully functional prototype. It is a full version of a CNC. I failed many times during this build but at the end I got precise CNC machine.

Music used to be done entirely with REAL instruments such as guitars and pianos but synthetic sounds have made their mark on the musical scene, as well. A great band to look at for an example is Kraftwerk, which in the 1970s used synthesizers to create all their sounds from the aggressive sawtooths to the gentle beep and boop of a computer. These synthesizers (unlike most ones you will find today) were all analogue which means that, instead of relying on software and processors, the sound generation was done by manipulating electrical signals against time. How does an old fashion synthesizer work? This series of projects will show how all the different parts in a synthesizer work and how to build your own modules. In this project, we will be building the heart of the synthesizer, the VCO (voltage-controlled oscillator), which takes in analogue voltages and generates the raw sounds ready to be further processed by filters, modulators, ADSR modules, and step sequences."</em> <a href="http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/projects/diy-synth-series-vco/">[...]</a></p>

There are three soft switches made of conductive fabric on the bottom of each shoe that are connected to an Adafruit Feather Bluefruit 32u4 board. The board is programmed to be recognized as a bluetooth keyboard so whenever a switch is closed it's read as a keystroke. For example, when a switch closes it's the same as the "n" key getting hit on the computer's keyboard. These keystrokes are mapped to sound files using a piece of free software called Soundplant. The shoes wirelessly connect through bluetooth and each time you tap a toe or click a heel a sound file will play from the computer.

<p><em>"I recently had the need to carefully measure a voltage with a microcontroller which lacks an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), and I hacked together a quick and dirty method to do just this using a comparator, two transistors, and a few passives. The purpose of this project is to make a crystal oven controller at absolute minimal cost with minimal complexity. Absolute voltage accuracy is not of high concern (i.e., holding temperature to 50.00 C) but precision is the primary goal (i.e., hold it within 0.01 C of an arbitrary target I set somewhere around 50 C). Voltage measurement is usually a balance of a few factors: precision, accuracy, cost, simplicity, and speed. The method I demonstrate here maximizes precision and simplicity while minimizing cost. High speed operation is not of interest (1-2 measurements per second is fine), and as mentioned before accuracy is not a chief concern as long as precision is maximized. I would feel neglectful if I didnt give a shout out to a few alternatives to this method: Using the 10-bit ADC built into most AVR microcontrollers (my go-to for ATMega328 at ATTiny85, but the ATTiny2313 doesnt have any) often combined with an op-amp like this, using an IC like the MCP3208 8-channel 12-bit ADC (very expensive at $3.66 on mouser) are a good option, and fancy alternative dual slope methods as described in this really good youtube video and even mentioned nicely in the digital volt meter (DVM) / LCD driver ICL1706 datasheet. Those addressed, my quick and dirty idea uses only a couple cents of components and 3 pins of a microcontroller. There is much room for improvement (see my notes about a 555 timer, voltage reference, and operational amplifiers at the bottom) but this is a good minimal case starting point. This type of measurement is perfect for high precision temperature measuring using things like an LM335, LM35, or thermistor."</em> <a href="http://www.swharden.com/wp/2016-09-09-adding-adc-to-microcontrollers-without-adc/">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/waywardgeek/infnoise">Infinite Noise TRNG (True Random Number Generator)</a></h2>

<p><em>"The Infinite Noise TRNG is a USB key hardware true random number generator. It uses what I call a "Modular Entropy Multiplier" architecture (previously Infinite Noise Multiplier or FireBug). Besides being simple, low-cost, and fast, it is much easier to get right than other TRNGs. It naturally defends against influence from outside signals, such as radio interference and power supply noise, making it simple to build securely, without requiring an expert in analog design. Modular entropy multipliers produce a provable and easily measured level of entropy based on thermal noise, approximately equal to log2(K) per output bit, where K is a gain between 1 and 2 set by two resistors around an op-amp. A "health monitor" can track this and verify that the output entropy is within the expected range, which for the Infinite Noise TRNG described below is within 2% of log2(1.82). Modular entropy multipliers are suitable for both board level implementation and ASIC implementation. Speed is limited by the speed of a gain stage and a comparator, and can run in excess of 100 Mbit/second per second with high performance components. Cheap solutions with CMOS quad op-amps can run at 8Mbit/second."</em> <a href="https://github.com/waywardgeek/infnoise">[...]</a></p>
