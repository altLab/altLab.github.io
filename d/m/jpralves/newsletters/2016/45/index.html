<p>No passado fim-de-semana estivemos a montar uma impressora 3D - a ADA. Mais uma aquisição para o altLab.</p>

<p>Esta semana o MIT apresentou um algoritmo designado de Polaris, que permite acelerar até 34% a leitura de páginas Web. Uma outra equipa do MIT e da universidade de Innsbruck apresentou um relatório onde dizem ter desenhado e construído um computador quântico a partir de 5 átomos. O computador que, através de pulsações de laser, usa o algoritmo de Shor a factorizar correctamente o numero 15. O sistema em causa foi desenhado de forma a que à medida que forem acrescentados átomos e lasers ficará maior e mais rápido. Um avanço tremendo para simplificar a factorização de números primos e por em causa os algoritmos de cifra baseados na dificuldade de factorizar este tipo de números. Foi lançada esta semana o Arduino IDE 1.6.8 que além de correcções de bugs trás algumas novas funcionalidades interessantes.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker e na rubrica "Documentação" apresentamos quatro livros (eBooks) que podem ser descarregados livremente e que esta semana são sobre Programação em Python, LaTeX, controlo de versões de ficheiros com o SVN e programação de base de dados defensiva com SQL Server. Falamos igualmente da revista newelectronics de 8 de março.</p>

<li><p><a href="http://news.mit.edu/2016/quantum-computer-end-encryption-schemes-0303">The beginning of the end for encryption schemes?</a></p>

<p><img src="NS45_TheBeginningOfTheEndForEncrypt.jpg" alt="NS45_TheBeginningOfTheEndForEncrypt" /></p>

<p><em>"What are the prime factors, or multipliers, for the number 15? Most grade school students know the answer — 3 and 5 — by memory. A larger number, such as 91, may take some pen and paper. An even larger number, say with 232 digits, can (and has) taken scientists two years to factor, using hundreds of classical computers operating in parallel. Because factoring large numbers is so devilishly hard, this “factoring problem” is the basis for many encryption schemes for protecting credit cards, state secrets, and other confidential data. It’s thought that a single quantum computer may easily crack this problem, by using hundreds of atoms, essentially in parallel, to quickly factor huge numbers. In 1994, Peter Shor, the Morss Professor of Applied Mathematics at MIT, came up with a quantum algorithm that calculates the prime factors of a large number, vastly more efficiently than a classical computer. However, the algorithm’s success depends on a computer with a large number of quantum bits. While others have attempted to implement Shor’s algorithm in various quantum systems, none have been able to do so with more than a few quantum bits, in a scalable way. Now, in a paper published today in the journal Science, researchers from MIT and the University of Innsbruck in Austria report that they have designed and built a quantum computer from five atoms in an ion trap. The computer uses laser pulses to carry out Shor’s algorithm on each atom, to correctly factor the number 15. The system is designed in such a way that more atoms and lasers can be added to build a bigger and faster quantum computer, able to factor much larger numbers. The results, they say, represent the first scalable implementation of Shor’s algorithm."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://news.mit.edu/2016/system-loads-web%20pages-34-percent-faster-0309">System loads Web pages 34 percent faster by fetching files more effectively</a></p>

<p><img src="NS45_SystemLoadsWebPages34PercentFa.jpg" alt="NS45_SystemLoadsWebPages34PercentFa" /></p>

<p><em>"There are few things more frustrating than a slow-loading Web page. For companies, what’s even worse is what comes after: users abandoning their site in droves. Amazon, for example, estimates that every 100-millisecond delay cuts its profits by 1 percent. To help combat this problem, researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and Harvard University have developed a system that decreases page-load times by 34 percent. Dubbed “Polaris,” the framework determines how to overlap the downloading of a page's objects, such that the overall page requires less time to load."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://blog.arduino.cc/2016/03/09/arduino-ide-1-6-8-available-for-download/">Arduino IDE 1.6.8: What’s new</a></p>

<p><img src="NS45_ArduinoIde168WhatsNew.jpg" alt="NS45_ArduinoIde168WhatsNew" /></p>

<p><em>"Today we are happy to release the Arduino IDE 1.6.8 and updated cores for almost all supported platforms (AVR 1.6.10, SAM 1.6.7, Curie 1.0.5). This new version of Arduino Software adds support for scaling interface for UHD monitors: if the IDE is too small because your display resolution is very high or just because you want it bigger :-) now you can set the scaling factor from the preferences panel. Another improvement is that the IDE now tries harder to remember the last window position when it’s closed and to restore it when it’s opened again. It’s a small improvement that should save some clicks every time the IDE is opened."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT45_RiceMakesLightDrivenNanosubmar.jpg" alt="CT45_RiceMakesLightDrivenNanosubmar" /></p>

<p><em>"Though they’re not quite ready for boarding a lá “Fantastic Voyage,” nanoscale submarines created at Rice University are proving themselves seaworthy. Each of the single-molecule, 244-atom submersibles built in the Rice lab of chemist James Tour has a motor powered by ultraviolet light. With each full revolution, the motor’s tail-like propeller moves the sub forward 18 nanometers. And with the motors running at more than a million RPM, that translates into speed. Though the sub’s top speed amounts to less than 1 inch per second, Tour said that’s a breakneck pace on the molecular scale."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT45_FullyTransparentSolarCell.jpg" alt="CT45_FullyTransparentSolarCell" /></p>

<p><em>"As you know,  solar cell , is an electrical device that converts the energy of light directly into electricity by the photovoltaic effect, which is a physical and chemical phenomenon. We all have seen those big stripped solar panels on the top of the houses. Though it is for a good cause but still it is somewhat out of place on your house. But now,  Michigan State University research team has finally created a truly transparent solar panel — a breakthrough that could soon usher in a world where windows, panes of glass, and even entire buildings could be used to generate solar energy."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://news.ncsu.edu/2015/11/narayan-q-carbon-2015/">Researchers Find New Phase of Carbon, Make Diamond at Room Temperature</a></p>

<p><img src="CT45_ResearchersFindNewPhaseOfCarbo.jpg" alt="CT45_ResearchersFindNewPhaseOfCarbo" /></p>

<p><em>"Researchers from North Carolina State University have discovered a new phase of solid carbon, called Q-carbon, which is distinct from the known phases of graphite and diamond. They have also developed a technique for using Q-carbon to make diamond-related structures at room temperature and at ambient atmospheric pressure in air."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT45_OrnlProcessCouldBeWhiteLightni.jpg" alt="CT45_OrnlProcessCouldBeWhiteLightni" /></p>

<p><em>"A new era of electronics and even quantum devices could be ushered in with the fabrication of a virtually perfect single layer of “white graphene,” according to researchers at the Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The material, technically known as hexagonal boron nitride, features better transparency than its sister, graphene, is chemically inert, or non-reactive, and atomically smooth. It also features high mechanical strength and thermal conductivity. Unlike graphene, however, it is an insulator instead of a conductor of electricity, making it useful as a substrate and the foundation for the electronics in cell phones, laptops, tablets and many other devices."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-12/osu-pm120115.php">Photonic 'sintering' may create new solar, electronics manufacturing technologies</a></p>

<p><img src="CT45_PhotonicSinteringMayCreateNewS.jpg" alt="CT45_PhotonicSinteringMayCreateNewS" /></p>

<p><em>"Engineers at Oregon State University have made a fundamental breakthrough in understanding the physics of photonic "sintering," which could lead to many new advances in solar cells, flexible electronics, various types of sensors and other high-tech products printed onto something as simple as a sheet of paper or plastic. Sintering is the fusing of nanoparticles to form a solid, functional thin-film that can be used for many purposes, and the process could have considerable value for new technologies. Photonic sintering has the possible advantage of higher speed and lower cost, compared to other technologies for nanoparticle sintering."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.liu.se/forskning/forskningsnyheter/1.662150?l=en">Storing electricity in paper</a></p>

<p><img src="CT45_StoringElectricityInPaper.jpg" alt="CT45_StoringElectricityInPaper" /></p>

<p><em>"Researchers at Linköping University’s Laboratory of Organic Electronics, Sweden, have developed power paper – a new material with an outstanding ability to store energy. The material consists of nanocellulose and a conductive polymer. The results have been published in Advanced Science. EnergipappretOne sheet, 15 centimetres in diameter and a few tenths of a millimetre thick can store as much as 1 F, which is similar to the supercapacitors currently on the market. The material can be recharged hundreds of times and each charge only takes a few seconds."</em></p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn-book.pdf">Version Control with Subversion For Subversion 1.7</a></p>

<p><em>"One of the greatest frustrations in most software projects is version control: the art of managing changes to information. Today's increasingly fast pace of software development--as programmers make small changes to software one day only to undo them the next--has only heightened the problem; consecutive work on code or single-programmer software is a rare sight these days. Without careful attention to version control, concurrent and collaborative work can create more headaches than it solves. This is where Subversion comes into play.Written by members of the Subversion open source development team, Version Control with Subversion introduces the powerful new versioning tool designed to be the successor to the Concurrent Version System or CVS."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"Hi, As this is my first instructable here, I hope you'll like it and feel free to ask about anything not clear in it. Firstly, I started this project after I wanted to control 4 Motors that requires relatively high power (12Volts, 4 Amperes) for each. After searching for a good shield to supply the motors with the required power, I found this one "4 Channel Motors Driver Controller". I wanted to buy it but I didn't find any simple tutorial for how to use it with Arduino. So I decided to read its datasheet and configure how I will use it with Arduino. Finally, I bought the board and It worked fine. So I decided to write this instructable to ease the process for the next users of the same board. In addition, just to prove the concept, I made a small hardware project which is an RC Car using ARDUINO + BLUETOOTH + 4CH MOTOR DRIVER CONTROLLER."</em></p></li>

It was made in very less budget and requires some components including arduino uno and bluetooth module! Basically the phone sends signal to HC-05 (bluetooth module) and further bluetooth module sends the characters to arduino's serial port and arduino sends particular IR signal decoded from your remote!!

<p><em>"Ive been thinking about building stuff with FPGAs for a while, and usually get turned away because FPGAs are considerably harder to implement than microcontrollers since they have no on-chip memory. It is necessary to re-program the gates every time they power up, which requires an external flash memory chip. There arent great references online for the DIY community, so I figured Id post how to get this working. Not using dev boards opens a world of opportunities, so Im a proponent of not using Arduinos and their FPGA equivalent for too long (sure, theyre good to get started with, but dont become dependent). Not wanting to screw up an expensive complex board by being a first-timer at putting an FPGA into a circuit, I figured Id build a little test board with the cheapest Spartan 6 you can get (about $10), which comes in a solderable TQFP144 package. Sadly, most high end FPGAs are BGA and therefore quite hard to solder as a DIY project."</em></p></li>
