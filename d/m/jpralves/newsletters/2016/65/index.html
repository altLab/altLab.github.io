<p>Esta semana o Facebook disponibilizou em formato open source os planos para a construção da sua câmara "Surround 360". Trata-se de uma câmara que captura video em 3D e a 360º. Ao fim de 40.000 KM percorridos o Solar Impulse 2 completou a sua viagem a volta do planeta apenas usando energia Solar. O MIT desenvolveu uma tecnologia capaz de apresentar imagens em 3D em salas de cinema sem o recurso a oculos. A Analog Devices vai adquirir a Linear Technologies por cerca de 30 mil milhões de dólares.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. Na rubrica "Documentação" apresentamos três revistas que podem ser descarregadas livremente e que esta semana são a MagPI nº 48, a newelectronics de 26 de Julho 2016 e a HispaBrick issue 25.</p>

<p><em>"Today we officially open-sourced the specs for Surround 360, our high-quality 3D-360 hardware and software video capture system. The open source project includes the hardware camera design and software stitching code that makes end-to-end 3D-360 video capture possible in one system — from shooting to video processing. We believe making the camera design and stitching code freely available on GitHub will accelerate the growth of the 3D-360 ecosystem — developers will be able to leverage the code, and content creators can use the camera in their productions. Anyone will be able to contribute to, build on top of, improve, or distribute the camera based on these specs."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"Synthetic biology allows researchers to program cells to perform novel functions such as fluorescing in response to a particular chemical or producing drugs in response to disease markers. In a step toward devising much more complex cellular circuits, MIT engineers have now programmed cells to remember and respond to a series of events. These cells can remember, in the correct order, up to three different inputs, but this approach should be scalable to incorporate many more stimuli, the researchers say. Using this system, scientists can track cellular events that occur in a particular order, create environmental sensors that store complex histories, or program cellular trajectories."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"Crew members on the International Space Station re-installed the first 3D printer in orbit, during the week of June 27, 2016, to continue research on the developing technology and how it can be used in space. NASA astronaut Jeff Williams installed the printer in the Microgravity Science Glovebox to begin another round of sample builds for NASA's 3D Printing in Zero-G Technology Demonstration. Williams took this photograph of the 3D printer on June 28, after installation. The 3D printer, originally delivered to the station and tested in 2014, heats a relatively low-temperature plastic filament to build parts layer by layer using designs supplied to the machine."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"Whenever a new piece of hardware comes out, there’s always people trying to port or emulate different operating systems onto them. The Raspberry Pi was no different, with several attempts at differing OSs when it was first launched. For over a year now though, Microsoft has officially supported Windows on the Raspberry Pi through Windows 10 IoT Core. In The MagPi 48 we cover the latest developments in Windows 10 IoT Core that have come about since the Raspberry Pi 3 was launched, and how to maker use of them in your own projects. We’ve also got exclusive news on an upcoming kit specifically for the Raspberry Pi 3 that lets you create amazing projects right out of the box. As well as all the Windows talk, we invite you to take part in the Scratch Olympics, continue building the arcade machine of your dreams, learn about Twitch-controlled robots, and read a review on the long-awaited NatureBytes wildlife camera. The MagPi 48 is out today in WH Smith, Tesco, Asda, and Sainsburys in the UK and will be in Microcenters and selected Barnes &amp; Nobles when it comes to America. You can also buy a copy online from our store, or get it digitally on our app that’s available for iOS and Android."</em></p></li>

<h1 id="Modelos-3D">Modelos 3D <a href="#topo">^</a></h1>

<p>Com a disponibilidade de ferramentas que permitem dar azo a nossa imaginação na criação de peças 3D e espaços como o <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/">thingiverse</a> para as publicar, esta rubrica apresenta alguns modelos selecionados que poderão ser úteis.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1653180">Parametric O-Ring</a></h2>

<p><img src="MP65_ParametricORing.jpg" alt="MP65_ParametricORing" /></p>

<p>O-Rings are an easy way to create an airtight seal between two surfaces. This Customizer script allows you to easily make 3D printable molds for silicone O-Rings by adjusting two parameters.</p>

<p>Parameter "Inner Diameter" defines the inner diameter of the ring
Parameter "Thickness" defines the diameter of the ring itself</p>

<p>Instructables Guide: http://www.instructables.com/id/Custom-O-Ring-Gaskets/
YouTube Video: https://youtu.be/NHhZk5iem8M</p>

<p>flange.stl can be printed to demonstrate an O-Ring with 10mm ID and 5mm thickness and is held together with M3 screws.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1693518">Subdivided Surfaces</a></h2>

<p><img src="MP65_SubdividedSurfaces.jpg" alt="MP65_SubdividedSurfaces" /></p>

<p>Hi!</p>

<p>This is a generator for 2D subdivided surfaces</p>

<p>A old script made with Processing (http://www.processing.org) a few years ago adapted to Openscad.</p>

<p>This thing was the precursor of Futuristic Citybuider (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1680965) and follows a similar algorithm but now in 2D</p>

<p>You can generate rectangles, circles or polygons with different sizes and subdivision patterns in customizer.</p>

<p>I'm using in combination with Polygon bases and frames (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1693462) to make some boxes and pencil-cases.</p>

<p>Also you can use it for decoration, bracelets (blendig with warm water) or what you imagine.</p>

<p>Includes some STL files and some ZIPs with even more STLs</p>

<p>Hope you enjoy it
Have fun!</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1686330">Hex Shank Bit Holder - Parametric</a></h2>

<p><img src="MP65_HexShankBitHolderParametric.jpg" alt="MP65_HexShankBitHolderParametric" /></p>

<p>This is a remix of the hex bit holder by TBRIshtar :
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:241501 - thanks TBRIshtar!</p>

<p>This remix mimics the original as close as possible but has the following
features:</p>

<p>Almost fully parametric
Any number of rows and columns, still keeping the edge rows open on the
sides. This is nice if the hex shank has the bit size stamped on it.
Footer height can be adjusted
Wall height can be adjusted
Allows easy scaling in the X and Y directions if your printer causes
the hex holes to be too tight, like mine does.
I use the OpenSCAD fillets lib https://github.com/jfhbrook/openscad-fillets
by jhfbrook for filleting the edges - Thanks jhfbrook!</p>

<p>The Holder() module takes all dimensional parameters as arguments, so can
easily be used from other SCAD files.</p>

<p>The original size of the holder by TBRIshtar are the defaults, but simply
override any dimensions you want in subsequent variables of the same name, or
change the originals.</p>

<p>Another quick way to generate STLs for any size is from the command line:</p>

<p>$ openscad -o output.stl -Dcolumns=7 -Dfoot=3 -D scl=1 bitHolder.scad
Note when using the command line you must supply the scl variable if you
do not want any scaling. This is because the file overrides the default scale
from 1.0 to a scaling I use on my printer. The same goes for height and
foot.</p>

By pushing the buttons, you cycle through all the letters of the alphabet to spell out your thoughts in acronym form, and the last frame is an animation of the very first cat video (by Eadweard Muybridge).

We took a 300w motor and the electronic parts out of the gym piece of equipment so the motor would be able to perform correctly! The next stage was to make an axle, using the lathe, where we put two old tires from a crashed four wheeler.

You can't really get an idea of wind conditions and gusts with a consumer weather station. The reason those displays are delayed is that they are trying to save battery power and the related solar panel cost by transmitting infrequently. This unit is powered by the display unit. The display unit's modified USB battery bank can be recharged via USB, or just left plugged in to a USB power adapter. I tried to keep costs lower than my previous wireless wind vane by using PVC sprinkler pipe rather than copper pipe. Also, by designing a wired system, that eliminates the wireless transmitter and receiver, instead using cheaper RS-485 transceivers. Wired systems can operate over greater distances and at greater speed without data dropouts that would be very annoying in the display unit."</em></p></li>

The air in the foyer began to have a slightly musty odor as no sunlight was coming in. My solution was to build a direct sunlight detector, allowing us to close the shades only when the buzzer went off. On overcast days the shades would stay open, as the direct sunlight would not set the alarm off (we live in the Eastern US, so overcast days are not uncommon).
