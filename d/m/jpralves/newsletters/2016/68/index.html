<p>Esta semana no fórum da Intel o seu CEO apresentou o Intel Joule compute module. Trata-se de uma plataforma de desenvolvimento de alto desempenho  especificamente dedicada ao IoT (Internet of Things). No mesmo evento foi igualmente anunciado o projecto Alloy que se trata de uma solução tudo-em-um de realidade virtual aumentada. A Google está a desenvolver um novo sistema designado de Fuchsia desenhado para correr em todas as plataformas. Trata-se de uma alteração na estratégia da Google que até à data tinha desenvolvido todos os seus sistemas recorrendo ao Linux. Contudo, como sabemos, o Linux não é solução para tudo e os engenheiros da Google estão a preparar este novo sistema. Muita documentação e código fonte foram disponibilizados pela Google no GitHub. Noutras noticias a AMD demonstrou uma melhoria significativa de desempenho na sua próxima geração de processadores Zen. A Microsoft disponibilizou o Powershell em open-source e disponível para Linux e MacOS. A Audi desenvolveu um tecnologia que poderá tornar os semáforos obsoletos. A Uber vai começar os testes em Pittsburgh com carros de condução autónoma. Em Helsínquia começaram os primeiros testes com autocarros de condução autónoma. A Intel vai fabricar processadores ARM. Por fim foi descoberto um tubarão na Gronelândia que se pensa ter cerca de 400 anos.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. Na rubrica "Documentação" apresentamos um novo livro da MagPI designado Simple Electronics with GPIO Zero.</p>

<p><em>"Every single operating system developed by Google to date has one thing in common: they're based on the Linux kernel. Chrome OS, Android, Chromecasts, you name it. Linux has powered Google hardware for years. However, the Linux kernel is not ideal for every situation. Especially in the case of embedded devices like car dashboards or GPS units, full-blown desktop kernels like Linux impact performance and cause other issues. Theres a massive ecosystem of operating systems designed for embedded hardware, and Google may be working on their own. Enter Fuchsia. Googles own description for it on the projects GitHub page is simply, Pink + Purple == Fuchsia (a new Operating System). Not very revealing, is it? When you begin to dig deeper into Fuchsias documentation, everything starts to make a little more sense."</em> <a href="http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/08/12/google-developing-new-fuchsia-os-also-likes-making-new-words/">[...]</a></p>

This demonstration marks a significant step forward in the development of energy-efficient, ultra-dense integrated neuromorphic technologies for applications in cognitive computing. Inspired by the way the biological brain functions, scientists have theorized for decades that it should be possible to imitate the versatile computational capabilities of large populations of neurons. However, doing so at densities and with a power budget that would be comparable to those seen in biology has been a significant challenge, until now."</em> <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/50297.wss">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"We learn a lot about objects by manipulating them: poking, pushing, prodding, and then seeing how they react. We obviously cant do that with videos  just try touching that cat video on your phone and see what happens. But is it crazy to think that we could take that video and simulate how the cat moves, without ever interacting with the real one? Researchers from MITs Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) have recently done just that, developing an imaging technique called Interactive Dynamic Video (IDV) that lets you reach in and touch objects in videos. Using traditional cameras and algorithms, IDV looks at the tiny, almost invisible vibrations of an object to create video simulations that users can virtually interact with."</em> <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/reach_in_and_touch_objects_in_videos_with%20_interactive_dynamic_video">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"This is a 3D Printable Robot Arm. It may need a bit more time to build one, than your normal weekend Project. But the build process is one thing, the application environment the other. And that is what it is all about. Learning, combining and developing custom applications. The design goal for me was to build a Robot, which is stiff and strong, but still small and easy to handle. I used the common NEMA17 Step Motors, which provide enough power for fast movements and high precision. Almost every moveable joint has at least one ball bearing to reduce friction, overall stability and accuracy. The robot is designed to have a low center of mass. The robot is powered over a Computer Power Supply (12V). The gripper is easy to replace and is held horizontally in every position, which simplifies programming and also reduces the cost and complexity of additional axies. Most parts have a industrial look like cast Iron parts."</em> <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1718984">[...]</a></p>

The Arduino controls 8 servos, each with a "mallet" attached. (These mallets are actually Lego bricks clumsily taped onto coffee sticks.) The Arduino is programmed to receive serial commands* from the python program. A command is one byte or 8 bits, each bit representing 'on' (play the note) and 'off' (do nothing) states of each servo. The monome is totally controlled by the python program. The program sends serial commands that, for example, tell the monome which buttons need to light up or turn off. It also receives serial data from the monome - like, which buttons are getting pressed and depressed."</em> <a href="https://github.com/pirxthepilot/monomepi-stepsequencer">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Vector network analyzer (VNA) are used to measure scattering parameters of high frequency circuits. When frequency is high enough the reflections of the waves start to matter and distributed effects need to be taken into account. VNA can be used to analyze reflection and transmission coefficients of circuits at high frequencies. For example ideally antenna would radiate all the energy it gets, but all antennas reflect some of the energy back to the source and only radiate energy at certain frequencies. With VNA amount of energy reflected as function of frequency can be measured. Amplifiers also reflect some energy from both input and output and have some amount of gain. All of which can be measured using VNA. Unfortunately VNAs are often very expensive and way out of my budget. Newest cutting edge VNAs with very wide frequency band can have insanely high cost. For example starting price of Anritsu's 110 GHz VectorStart ME7838A VNA is $575,850. Even used VNAs for lower frequencies are often several thousand dollars. At ebay cheapest used 6 GHz two port VNAs seem to sell for about 2,000, still way more than I'm willing to pay. Since I can't afford even a used VNA I decided to make one myself with a budget of 200, tenth of what they cost used and about 1/100 of what they cost new. Of course it isn't going to be as accurate as commercial VNAs, but I don't need that high accuracy and it's a good learning experience anyway."</em> <a href="http://hforsten.com/cheap-homemade-30-mhz-6-ghz-vector-network-analyzer.html">[...]</a></p>

So the need may arise to interface between logic working at different voltage levels. There are several ways of doing this, depending on your needs. Things are relatively simple as long as you know in advance which side is transmitting and which side is receiving. It gets more difficult if the communication is bi-directional or with busses such as I2C that are bi-directional by nature. I did a search on farnell.com and identified two chips that can translate between almost any two voltage levels bi-directionally. The Texas Instruments TXB0106 works with up to 6 CMOS (i.e. actively driven high or low) signals for protocols such as SPI. The PCA9306 (also from TI) is intended for protocols such as I2C that rely on pull-up resistors and where a line must never be actively driven high."</em> <a href="https://soldernerd.com/2016/08/15/bi-directional-voltage-level-translator-board-house-test/">[...]</a></p>

We had chosen the Arduino 101 along with the Grove Starter Kit for Arduino as our platform and were looking for a capstone project that would reinforce lots of the concepts we had been teaching as well as being memorable and fun. Through my network, I found some awesome Rover kits that were based on Edison and used Wi-Fi - it was the Seeedstudio Skeleton Bot - a 4WD mobile robotic platform.

However, I've noticed that sleeping without an alarm clock, and just waking up whenever I wake up, helps. And I've also noticed that sometimes when I wake up I am dramatically more refreshed than usual. Reading about sleep on the web led me to learn more about sleep cycles. One interesting page ("The power of the Sleep Cycle") claimed that it wasn't the amount of sleep one gets, but the part of the sleep cycle we wake up in. The author suggested that, because we sleep in cycles about 90 minutes long, we should aim to wake up in the transition between sleep cycles, since the brain is more alert and refreshed at that time."</em> <a href="http://flyingpudding.com/projects/sleep_tracker/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"The automotive electrical system is a harsh environment. Normal voltages range from 9 to 15 volts, and even greater extremes. A jump start from a tow truck often pushes 24 volts down the wires. Stopping the engine can generates a spike up to 130 volts. And if a battery cable comes undone, the load dump can send 40 amps looking for somewhere to go. Automotive equipment, like the factory or after-market radio, is designed for this. But consumer electronics, especially the "cost minimized" imports, can easily be blown out of the water, or sunk by cumulative damage."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Surge-Protector-for-Automobile-Use/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"In this instructable I'm going to show you how you can make your very own automatic plant watering system. The best part? This solution requires no pump! The benefit of using an automatic watering system is that you avoid having your plants start to dry out, and you also wont accidentally soak your plants. The moisture is kept at the perfect level for your plants and you end up using less water!"</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/No-Pump-Automatic-Watering/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"I've two solar charge controllers from EPsolar or EPever as they are sometimes known. They are great and have a COM port for monitoring the performance of the panels and state of the battery etc but it's a pain to drag the laptop out and hook things up just to check the status. The COM port is a RJ45 port which uses the RS485 standard so i investigated commercial offerings but they were extremely expensive and as this was just to make things convenient for a personal home product i didn't fancy paying 50 out for the privilege. I began to investigate doing this myself and using some off the shelf components and custom firmware from the guys at esp-link i was able to come up with the design you can see in the picture."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Wireless-Solar-Charge-Controller-Monitor-RS485-to-/">[...]</a></p>
