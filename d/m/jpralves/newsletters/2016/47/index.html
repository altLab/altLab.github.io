<p><img src="NS47_NecDevelopsBiometricsTechnolog.jpg" alt="NS47_NecDevelopsBiometricsTechnolog" /></p>

<p><em>" NEC Corporation today announced the development of a new biometric personal identification technology that uses the resonation of sound determined by the shape of human ear cavities to distinguish individuals. The new technology instantaneously measures (within approximately one second) acoustic characteristics determined by the shape of the ear, which is unique for each person, using an earphone with a built-in microphone to collect earphone-generated sounds as they resonate within ear cavities. This unique method for extracting features is useful for distinguishing individuals based on acoustic characteristics and enables rapid and highly accurate recognition (greater than 99% accuracy)."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="NS47_AndrewSGrove19362016.jpg" alt="NS47_AndrewSGrove19362016" /></p>

<p><em>"Intel announced that the company’s former CEO and Chairman Andrew S. Grove passed away today at the age of 79. Present at Intel’s 1968 founding with Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore, Andy Grove became Intel’s President in 1979 and CEO in 1987. He served as Chairman of the Board from 1997 to 2005. Both during his time at Intel and in retirement, Grove was one of the most influential figures in technology and business, writing best-selling books and widely cited articles, and speaking out on an array of prominent public issues."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="NS47_AncientPolarIceRevealsTiltingO.jpg" alt="NS47_AncientPolarIceRevealsTiltingO" /></p>

<p><em>"Did the “man in the moon” look different from ancient Earth? New NASA-funded research provides evidence that the spin axis of Earth’s moon shifted by about five degrees roughly three billion years ago. The evidence of this motion is recorded in the distribution of ancient lunar ice, evidence of delivery of water to the early solar system."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://newscenter.ti.com/MSP430FR2311MCU">TI introduces the world’s first microcontroller with a configurable low-leakage transimpedance amplifier</a></p>

<p><img src="NS47_TiIntroducesTheWorldsFirstMicr.jpg" alt="NS47_TiIntroducesTheWorldsFirstMicr" /></p>

<p><em>"Texas Instruments customers can now extend battery life in sensing and measurement applications with the new MSP430FR2311 microcontroller (MCU), the industry’s only MCU with an integrated low-leakage transimpedance amplifier (TIA) consuming just 50pA of current. The new microcontroller – an expansion of the ultra-low-power MSP430™ MCU family – offers 20 times lower leakage than alternative voltage and current sensing solutions and provides the configurability of analog and memory technology without sacrificing battery life or board space. Highly integrated MCU solution with configurable analog helps developers simplify their schematics and save PCB space by up to 75 percent. The MSP430FR2311 MCU allows developers to connect to a wide range of sensors with its analog integration including ADC, op amp, comparators and TIA. This solution also integrates Ferroelectric Random Access Memory (FRAM) technology and eliminates the need for an onboard crystal in a single 3.5 mm x 4 mm package. This single chip solution will reduce design complexity and overall project development time."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT47_ThisArticleCanBePrintedOnAHair.jpg" alt="CT47_ThisArticleCanBePrintedOnAHair" /></p>

<p><em>"A nanotechnology breakthrough from DTU revolutionizes laser printing technology, allowing you to print high-resolution data and colour images of unprecedented quality and microscopic dimensions. Using this new technology, DTU researchers from DTU Nanotech and DTU Fotonik have reproduced a colour image of Mona Lisa which is less than one pixel on an iPhone Retina display. The laser technology allows printing in a mind-blowing resolution of 127,000 DPI. In comparison, weekly or monthly magazines are normally printed in a resolution equivalent to 300 DPI."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://news.mit.edu/2015/carbon-nanotubes-detect-rare-proteins-viruses-1221">New device uses carbon nanotubes to snag molecules</a></p>

<p><img src="CT47_NewDeviceUsesCarbonNanotubesTo.jpg" alt="CT47_NewDeviceUsesCarbonNanotubesTo" /></p>

<p><em>"Engineers at MIT have devised a new technique for trapping hard-to-detect molecules, using forests of carbon nanotubes. The team modified a simple microfluidic channel with an array of vertically aligned carbon nanotubes — rolled lattices of carbon atoms that resemble tiny tubes of chicken wire. The researchers had previously devised a method for standing carbon nanotubes on their ends, like trees in a forest. With this method, they created a three-dimensional array of permeable carbon nanotubes within a microfluidic device, through which fluid can flow."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://mesh.brown.edu/unsync/">Unsynchronized Structured Light</a></p>

<p><img src="CT47_UnsynchronizedStructuredLight.jpg" alt="CT47_UnsynchronizedStructuredLight" /></p>

<p><em>"Various Structured Light (SL) methods are used to capture 3D range images, where a number of binary or continuous light patterns are sequentially projected onto a scene of interest, while a digital cam- era captures images of the illuminated scene. All existing SL meth- ods require the projector and camera to be hardware or software synchronized, with one image captured per projected pattern. A 3D range image is computed from the captured images. The two synchronization methods have disadvantages, which limit the use of SL methods to niche industrial and low quality consumer ap- plications. Unsynchronized Structured Light (USL) is a novel SL method which does not require synchronization of pattern projec- tion and image capture. The light patterns are projected and the images are captured independently, at constant, but possibly dif- ferent, frame rates. USL synthesizes new binary images as would be decoded from the images captured by a camera synchronized to the projector, reducing the subsequent computation to standard SL. USL works both with global and rolling shutter cameras. USL enables most burst-mode-capable cameras, such as modern smart- phones, tablets, DSLRs, and point-and-shoots, to function as high quality 3D snapshot cameras. Beyond the software, which can run in the devices, a separate SL Flash, able to project the sequence of patterns cyclically, during the acquisition time, is needed to enable the functionality."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.ornl.gov/news/ornl-cell-free-protein-synthesis-potential-lifesaver">ORNL cell-free protein synthesis is potential lifesaver</a></p>

<p><img src="CT47_OrnlCellFreeProteinSynthesisIs.jpg" alt="CT47_OrnlCellFreeProteinSynthesisIs" /></p>

<p><em>"Lives of soldiers and others injured in remote locations could be saved with a cell-free protein synthesis system developed at the Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The device, a creation of a team led by Andrea Timm and Scott Retterer of the lab’s Biosciences Division, uses microfabricated bioreactors to facilitate the on-demand production of therapeutic proteins for medicines and biopharmaceuticals. Making these miniature factories cell-free, which eliminates the maintenance of a living system, simplifies the process and lowers cost."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://news.psu.edu/story/388410/2016/01/20/research/self-heating-lithium-ion-battery-could-beat-winter-woes">Self-heating lithium-ion battery could beat the winter woes</a></p>

<p><img src="CT47_SelfHeatingLithiumIonBatteryCo.jpg" alt="CT47_SelfHeatingLithiumIonBatteryCo" /></p>

<p><em>"A lithium-ion battery that self heats if the temperature is below 32 degrees Fahrenheit has multiple applications, but may have the most impact on relieving winter "range anxiety" for electric vehicle owners, according to a team of researchers from Penn State and EC Power, State College."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://wyss.harvard.edu/viewpressrelease/239/">Novel 4D printing method blossoms from botanical inspiration</a></p>

<p><img src="CT47_Novel4DPrintingMethodBlossomsF.jpg" alt="CT47_Novel4DPrintingMethodBlossomsF" /></p>

<p><em>"Materials science and mathematics combine to enable the printing of shapeshifting architectures that mimic the natural movements of plants. A team of scientists at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University and the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences has evolved their microscale 3D printing technology to the fourth dimension, time. Inspired by natural structures like plants, which respond and change their form over time according to environmental stimuli, the team has unveiled 4D-printed hydrogel composite structures that change shape upon immersion in water."</em></p></li>

<h1 id="Modelos-3D">Modelos 3D <a href="#topo">^</a></h1>

<p>Com a disponibilidade de ferramentas que permitem dar azo a nossa imaginação na criação de peças 3D e espaços como o <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/">thingiverse</a> para as publicar, esta rubrica apresenta alguns modelos selecionados que poderão ser úteis.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1427031">Braille Alphabet ( customisable )</a></h2>

<p><img src="MP47_BrailleAlphabetCustomisable.jpg" alt="MP47_BrailleAlphabetCustomisable" /></p>

<p>I made customisable Braille Alphabet.</p>

<p>You can customise character detail.
I don't know it can be utilized.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1432052">Enclosure With Screw Stand-offs</a></h2>

<p><img src="MP47_EnclosureWithScrewStandOffs.jpg" alt="MP47_EnclosureWithScrewStandOffs" /></p>

<p>Here is a customizable enclosure that includes screw stand-offs and counter-sunk holes in the lid. The parameters for height, width and depth are all external dimensions, so to figure out your internal dimensions you will have to account for the thickness as well.</p>

<p>Tip: Once you have the STL for the size of the enclosure you want, import that into TinkerCAD and use "hole" objects to "cut" openings into the enclosure before you print it. With careful measuring and planning, you can save yourself the trouble of having to do it Post-Printing.</p>

<p>I needed to organize my workspace (which is not expendable), and I decided to repack some of my tools boxes.
Here you'll found how I arrange my drills or mini tools accessories.
Now I can slide it in a drawer or a small shelf.
The way it has been design allows you to pick up easily any tool from a row.

Of course it works, and if you make it often,  can be really good at this. Some of my iron-boards was looking great, while other forcing me to make them again. I thought, lets give a try to make PCB process more pleasant. I went to the shop and bought Tracer TRL-A3. Originally I wanted A4, but at Saturday guys have only this, and it was cheaper than smaller one. I've got even 10 sheets for laminating, I've used 2 to check it lamiantor is working, and started disassembling process :)"</em></p></li>

<p><em>"The Internet-of-Things Power Meter (IPM) is a device fixed on top of the regular household power meter that provides detailed information about the electricity usage. Modern power meters have a LED blinking every time a Watt is used, the IPM detects these flashes using a light sensor, counts them, saves the values to an SD card. Later the data is stored to the cloud. Usually power companies provide very rough electricity usage data, the IPM provides data with a minute resolution. Knowing the household electricity usage allows to extrapolate statistics and can give precise numbers about the costs. "</em></p></li>

<p><em>"I wanted to use a low cost rotary encoder as an input mechanism for one of my upcoming projects and was initially bewildered by the code options available to take readings from the rotary encoder and determine how many "detents" or cycles the encoder had clicked past and in what direction. I think my main sketch will need to use most of my Arduino's memory so I am avoiding the various available encoder libraries which seemed to be difficult to make work when I tried a couple of them and use far more of the code budget than the sketch-based code approaches discussed from here on."</em></p></li>
