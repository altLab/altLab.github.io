<p>Esta semana foi anunciado que irá ser lançado o Bluetooth 5 que irá aumentar significativamente o alcance, a velocidade e a capacidade de difusão de mensagens. Com a expectativa de quadruplicar o alcance e duplicar a velocidade de ligações de baixo consumo tratam-se de boas noticias para o universo IoT. A Datwyler vai adquirir a Premier Farnell - conhecida pelo fabrico do Raspberry PI. Um grupo de interessados conseguiu reunir-se e fazer renascer um conector que se encontrava obsoleto e sem produção. Trata-se de um conector DB-19  que é usado no computadores Macintosh antigos para ligar discos e que pode atualmente ser usado através de um emulador.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. Na rubrica "Documentação" apresentamos oito livros (eBooks) que podem ser descarregados livremente e que esta semana são sobre Migração de Bases de Dados SQL server para a Azure, introdução a sociologia, iniciação ao desenvolvimento de aplicações Open Source, iniciação ao desenvolvimento de aplicações em DB2, aprendendo Perl da forma mais complicada, percebendo Big Data, construção de compiladores e guia de bolso do Ubuntu.</p>

<p>Está disponível por mais alguns dias um pacote de eBooks que considero muito interessante pelo custo. Podem consultar no <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/books/make-electronics-book-bundle">Link</a> do Humble Bumble.</p>

<p>Na próxima semana (dias 25 e 26) realiza-se no pavilhão do conhecimento a Maker Faire Lisboa, o altLab irá participar com diversos projecto que irei falar na próxima newsletter.</p>

<p><img src="NS59_Bluetooth5QuadruplesRangeDoubl.jpg" alt="NS59_Bluetooth5QuadruplesRangeDoubl" /></p>

<p><em>"The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) announced that its next release, coming late 2016 to early 2017, will be called Bluetooth 5 and will include significantly increased range, speed, and broadcast messaging capacity. Extending range will deliver robust, reliable Internet of Things (IoT) connections that make full-home and building and outdoor use cases a reality. Higher speeds will send data faster and optimize responsiveness. Increasing broadcast capacity will propel the next generation of “connectionless” services like beacons and location-relevant information and navigation. These Bluetooth advancements open up more possibilities and enable SIG companies – now at an all-time high of 30,000 member companies – to build an accessible, interoperable IoT. Bluetooth 5, projected for release in late 2016 to early 2017, will quadruple range and double speed of low energy connections while increasing the capacity of connectionless data broadcasts by 800 percent. It achieves all this alongside its industry-leading power performance. With the major boost in broadcast messaging capacity, the data being transferred will be richer, more intelligent. This will redefine the way Bluetooth devices transmit information, moving away from the app-paired-to-device model to a connectionless IoT where there is less need to download an app or connect the app to a device."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"Today, the boards of Dätwyler Holding AG ("Datwyler") and Premier Farnell plc ("Premier Farnell") have reached agreement on the terms of a recommended all-cash offer by Datwyler for the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Premier Farnell (the "Transaction"). Premier Farnell and Datwyler are two leading distributors of electronic components with complementary product ranges and geographic market presence.

<p><img src="NS59_Db19ResurrectingAnObsoleteConn.jpg" alt="NS59_Db19ResurrectingAnObsoleteConn" /></p>

<p><em>"This is a happy story about the power of global communication and manufacturing resources in today’s world. If you’ve been reading this blog for any length of time, then you’ve certainly heard me whine and moan about how impossible it is to find the obscure DB-19 disk connector used on vintage Macintosh and Apple II computers (and some NeXT and Atari computers too). Nobody has made these connectors for decades. I’ve got a disk emulator product called Floppy Emu that attaches to an Apple DB-19 port, so I need a steady supply of these connectors to build my hardware, and that’s a problem. Over the past couple of years, I’ve scrounged what seems like every warehouse and basement on the planet, and bought up nearly the entire world’s remaining supply of new-old-stock DB-19 connectors. My last few product batches included DB-19s from some very obscure international sources. It was clear I’d reached the end of the road."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT59_LigoDoesItAgainASecondRobustBi.jpg" alt="CT59_LigoDoesItAgainASecondRobustBi" /></p>

<p><em>"The two LIGO gravitational wave detectors in Hanford Washington and Livingston Louisiana have caught a second robust signal from two black holes in their final orbits and then their coalescence into a single black hole. This event, dubbed GW151226, was seen on December 26th at 03:38:53 (in Universal Coordinated Time, also known as Greenwich Mean Time), near the end of LIGO's first observing period ("O1"), and was immediately nicknamed "the Boxing Day event". Like LIGO's first detection, this event was identified within minutes of the gravitational wave's passing. Subsequent careful studies of the instruments and environments around the observatories showed that the signal seen in the two detectors was truly from distant black holes – some 1.4 billion light years away, coincidentally at about the same distance as the first signal ever detected. The Boxing Day event differed from the LIGO's first gravitational wave observation in some important ways, however."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT59_GeneCircuitsInLiveCellsCanPerf.jpg" alt="CT59_GeneCircuitsInLiveCellsCanPerf" /></p>

<p><em>"Living cells are capable of performing complex computations on the environmental signals they encounter.
These computations can be continuous, or analogue, in nature — the way eyes adjust to gradual changes in the light levels. They can also be digital, involving simple on or off processes, such as a cell’s initiation of its own death. Synthetic biological systems, in contrast, have tended to focus on either analogue or digital processing, limiting the range of applications for which they can be used. But now a team of researchers at MIT has developed a technique to integrate both analogue and digital computation in living cells, allowing them to form gene circuits capable of carrying out complex processing operations."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004829">The Evolutionary Origins of Hierarchy</a></p>

<p><img src="CT59_TheEvolutionaryOriginsOfHierar.jpg" alt="CT59_TheEvolutionaryOriginsOfHierar" /></p>

<p><em>"Hierarchical organization—the recursive composition of sub-modules—is ubiquitous in biological networks, including neural, metabolic, ecological, and genetic regulatory networks, and in human-made systems, such as large organizations and the Internet. To date, most research on hierarchy in networks has been limited to quantifying this property. However, an open, important question in evolutionary biology is why hierarchical organization evolves in the first place. It has recently been shown that modularity evolves because of the presence of a cost for network connections. Here we investigate whether such connection costs also tend to cause a hierarchical organization of such modules. In computational simulations, we find that networks without a connection cost do not evolve to be hierarchical, even when the task has a hierarchical structure. However, with a connection cost, networks evolve to be both modular and hierarchical, and these networks exhibit higher overall performance and evolvability (i.e. faster adaptation to new environments). Additional analyses confirm that hierarchy independently improves adaptability after controlling for modularity. Overall, our results suggest that the same force–the cost of connections–promotes the evolution of both hierarchy and modularity, and that these properties are important drivers of network performance and adaptability. In addition to shedding light on the emergence of hierarchy across the many domains in which it appears, these findings will also accelerate future research into evolving more complex, intelligent computational brains in the fields of artificial intelligence and robotics."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.vttresearch.com/media/news/novel-energy-inside-a-microcircuit-chip">Novel energy inside a microcircuit chip: VTT developed an efficient nanomaterial-based integrated energy storage</a></p>

<p><img src="CT59_NovelEnergyInsideAMicrocircuit.jpg" alt="CT59_NovelEnergyInsideAMicrocircuit" /></p>

<p><em>"VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland developed an extremely efficient small-size energy storage, a micro-supercapacitor, which can be integrated directly inside a silicon microcircuit chip. The high energy and power density of the miniaturized energy storage relies on the new hybrid nanomaterial developed recently at VTT. This technology opens new possibilities for integrated mobile devices and paves the way for zero-power autonomous devices required for the future Internet of Things (IoT). Supercapacitors resemble electrochemical batteries. However, in contrast to for example mobile phone lithium ion batteries, which utilize chemical reactions to store energy, supercapacitors store mainly electrostatic energy that is bound at the interface between liquid and solid electrodes. Similarly to batteries supercapacitors are typically discrete devices with large variety of use cases from small electronic gadgets to the large energy storages of electrical vehicles."</em></p></li>

<p>Genuino / Arduino Uno ProtoShield - Circuit Board</p>

<p>Printable circuit board for your Arduino Uno project. If you don't have pin connectors you can connect the shield to Arduino with cable (that's why I'm design this shield). There is a special .stl file with cable mount. When soldering be careful so that the plastic does not melt. I attached a paper with front face and back side of this board to design you shield by pen.</p>

<p>This is a simple enclosure (aka "a box") with variations on the matching lid.</p>

<p>Lid Notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>The lid can be a simple flat plate, have a lip or be omitted completely.</li>
<li>Lip Width only applies to the Partial lip.</li>
<li>Additional height added to lip will make the inner lip taller</li>

Almost all my projects before that point had consisted of AVRs and PICs (Im in the AVR camp now), but now ARM-based microcontrollers had become serious contenders for something that I could go to instead. I soon began working on a small development board project also involving some Freescale Kinetis microcontrollers since those are what I have become the most familiar with. Sadly, I have had little success since I have been trying to make a programmer myself (the official one is a minimum of $200). During the course of this project I came across a LOT of STM32 stuff and it seemed that it was actually quite easy to set up. Lots of the projects used the STM32 Discovery and similar dev boards, which are a great tools and provide an easy introduction to ARM microcontrollers. However, my interest is more towards doing very bare metal development. Like soldering the chip to a board and hooking it up to a programmer. Who needs any of that dev board stuff? For some reason I just find doing embedded development without a development board absolutely fascinating. Some people might interpret doing things this way as a form of masochism.

<p><em>"This wireless weather vane has some unique features- wind direction with a simple, economical, and accurate absolute encoder. Some consumer weather stations Comparison have a limited wind direction resolution of 22.5 degrees, updated every 14 seconds. This weather station's wind direction has a resolution of one tenth degree, updated once a second. The Bluetooth LE module, a HM-10, allows sleeping between display readings to save power."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"I'm sick and tired of pressing buttons to turn on lights and fan of my room, so I thought of making an automation circuit for my room, but I wanted no buttons to press even no screen to tap, no android interface, no IR remote, I wanted it to be completely autonomous system. So, I came up with this circuit which makes use of two PIR sensors and a ATTiny85. I wanted to use as minimum as possible hardware."</em></p></li>
