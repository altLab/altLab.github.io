<p>A 3 de Novembro de 1957 a URSS lançava o <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_2">Sputnik 2</a> e a bordo do mesmo ia a cadela <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laika">Laika</a>. Tratou-se da primeira nave a ser lançada no espaço com um ser vivo. Tinha 4 metros de altura, a base tinha 2 metros de diâmetro e pesava cerca de 500 kg. Esteve no espaço cerca de 162 dias. Nas noticias da semana foi lançado em open source um novo sistema operativo construído de raíz designado por Minoca OS. É um sistema operativo com uma interface tipo POSIX e corre atualmente nas arquitecturas x86 e ARM. A China começou a construir o seu primeiro super-computador exascale. Com capacidade de operar a 1000 Petaflops terá 10 vezes a capacidade do actual detentor do titulo do super-computador mais rápido - o <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunway_TaihuLight">Sunway TaihuLight</a>. Ficámos também a saber que uma companhia inglesa está a desenvolver um veiculo destinado ao transporte de mercadorias. Este é feito com materiais compósitos que reduzem significativamente o peso do veiculo e cuja propulsão é feita com motores eléctricos. A companhia que está por detrás deste fabrico é a Charge. A Lattice Semiconductors vai ser adquirida pela Canyon Bridge Capital Partners, Inc.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como alguns modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis.</p>

<p><em>"Take some metal scraps from the junkyard; put them in a glass jar with a common household chemical; and, voil, you have a high-performance battery. 'Imagine that the tons of metal waste discarded every year could be used to provide energy storage for the renewable energy grid of the future, instead of becoming a burden for waste processing plants and the environment,' said Cary Pint, assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Vanderbilt University. To make such a future possible, Pint headed a research team that used scraps of steel and brass two of the most commonly discarded materials to create the world's first steel-brass battery that can store energy at levels comparable to lead-acid batteries while charging and discharging at rates comparable to ultra-fast charging supercapacitors."</em> <a href="https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2016/11/02/making-high-performance-batteries-from-junkyard-scraps/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Researchers at the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory have demonstrated that permanent magnets produced by additive manufacturing can outperform bonded magnets made using traditional techniques while conserving critical materials. Scientists fabricated isotropic, near-net-shape, neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) bonded magnets at DOE's Manufacturing Demonstration Facility at ORNL using the Big Area Additive Manufacturing (BAAM) machine. The result, published in Scientific Reports, was a product with comparable or better magnetic, mechanical, and microstructural properties than bonded magnets made using traditional injection molding with the same composition. The additive manufacturing process began with composite pellets consisting of 65 volume percent isotropic NdFeB powder and 35 percent polyamide (Nylon-12) manufactured by Magnet Applications, Inc. The pellets were melted, compounded, and extruded layer-by-layer by BAAM into desired forms."</em> <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/news/3d-printed-permanent-magnets-outperform-conventional-versions-conserve-rare-materials">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="https://share.sandia.gov/news/resources/news_releases/quantum_computing/#.WBumiszyi00#.WBumiszyi00">Diamonds Arent Forever: Sandia, Harvard team create first quantum computer bridge</a></h2>

<p><em>"By forcefully embedding two silicon atoms in a diamond matrix, Sandia researchers have demonstrated for the first time on a single chip all the components needed to create a quantum bridge to link quantum computers together. People have already built small quantum computers, says Sandia researcher Ryan Camacho. Maybe the first useful one wont be a single giant quantum computer but a connected cluster of small ones. Distributing quantum information on a bridge, or network, could also enable novel forms of quantum sensing, since quantum correlations allow all the atoms in the network to behave as though they were one single atom. The joint work with Harvard University used a focused ion beam implanter at Sandias Ion Beam Laboratory designed for blasting single ions into precise locations on a diamond substrate. Sandia researchers Ed Bielejec, Jose Pacheco and Daniel Perry used implantation to replace one carbon atom of the diamond with the larger silicon atom, which causes the two carbon atoms on either side of the silicon atom to feel crowded enough to flee. That leaves the silicon atom a kind of large landowner, buffered against stray electrical currents by the neighboring non-conducting vacancies. Though the silicon atoms are embedded in a solid, they behave as though floating in a gas, and therefore their electrons response to quantum stimuli are not clouded by unwanted interactions with other matter."</em> <a href="https://share.sandia.gov/news/resources/news_releases/quantum_computing/#.WBumiszyi00#.WBumiszyi00">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"In 1959 renowned physicist Richard Feynman, in his talk Plenty of Room at the Bottom, spoke of a future in which tiny machines could perform huge feats. Like many forward-looking concepts, his molecule and atom-sized world remained for years in the realm of science fiction. And then, scientists and other creative thinkers began to realize Feynmans nanotechnological visions. In the spirit of Feynmans insight, and in response to the challenges he issued as a way to inspire scientific and engineering creativity, electrical and computer engineers at UC Santa Barbara have developed a design for a functional nanoscale computing device. The concept involves a dense, three-dimensional circuit operating on an unconventional type of logic that could, theoretically, be packed into a block no bigger than 50 nanometers on any side."</em> <a href="http://www.news.ucsb.edu/2016/017349/tiny-machine">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"A team of engineers at the University of California San Diego has developed a magnetic ink that can be used to make self-healing batteries, electrochemical sensors and wearable, textile-based electrical circuits. The key ingredient for the ink is microparticles oriented in a certain configuration by a magnetic field. Because of the way theyre oriented, particles on both sides of a tear are magnetically attracted to one another, causing a device printed with the ink to heal itself. The devices repair tears as wide as 3 millimetersa record in the field of self-healing systems."</em> <a href="http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/news/news_releases/release.sfe?id=2056">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"When the Wright brothers accomplished their first powered flight more than a century ago, they controlled the motion of their Flyer 1 aircraft using wires and pulleys that bent and twisted the wood-and-canvas wings. This system was quite different than the separate, hinged flaps and ailerons that have performed those functions on most aircraft ever since. But now, thanks to some high-tech wizardry developed by engineers at MIT and NASA, some aircraft may be returning to their roots, with a new kind of bendable, morphing wing. The new wing architecture, which could greatly simplify the manufacturing process and reduce fuel consumption by improving the wings aerodynamics, as well as improving its agility, is based on a system of tiny, lightweight subunits that could be assembled by a team of small specialized robots, and ultimately could be used to build the entire airframe. The wing would be covered by a skin made of overlapping pieces that might resemble scales or feathers."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2016/morphing-airplane-wing-design-1103">[...]</a></p>

If you just increase theta with the same amount, the distance between each segment of the moving fish would also be increased. In order to equally spaced each segment, I need to find out all angles between each segment. That's what the find_parent_angles module does in the .scad file. For more precisely controlling models between each segment, I also divide all parent angles found by the find_parent_angles module into several sub angles which may be controlled by the children_per_step parameter."</em> <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1782226">[...]</a></p>
