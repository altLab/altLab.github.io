<p>Esta semana a câmara de alta resolução da Rosetta (sonda que se encontra no espaço desde 2004) conseguiu descobrir finalmente o modúlo Philae no cometa 67P/ChuryumovGerasimenko. A menos de um mês do final da sua missão pode-se dizer que foi um sucesso. A Facebook desenvolveu um novo algoritmo de compressão designado por Zstandard que apresenta melhoras substanciais em termos de taxas de compressão versus o tempo de processamento. A fundação Raspberry Pi está de parabéns por ter conseguido o feito de terem vendido um total de 10 milhões de Raspberry Pi. Para comemorar esse feito apresentou um starter Kit que para funcionar apenas lhe falta o écran.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como alguns modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis.</p>

<p><em>"People are creating, sharing, and storing data at a faster rate than at any other time in history. When it comes to innovating on storing and transmitting that data, at Facebook we're making advancements not only in hardware  such as larger hard drives and faster networking equipment  but in software as well. Software helps with data processing through compression, which encodes information, like text, pictures, and other forms of digital data, using fewer bits than the original. These smaller files take up less space on hard drives and are transmitted faster to other systems. There's a trade-off to compressing and decompressing information, though: time. The more time spent compressing to a smaller file, the slower the data is to process. Today, the reigning data compression standard is Deflate, the core algorithm inside Zip, gzip, and zlib [2]. For two decades, it has provided an impressive balance between speed and space, and, as a result, it is used in almost every modern electronic device (and, not coincidentally, used to transmit every byte of the very blog post you are reading). Over the years, other algorithms have offered either better compression or faster compression, but rarely both. We believe we've changed this."</em> <a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/1658392934479273/smaller-and-faster-data-compression-with-zstandard/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"When we started Raspberry Pi, we had a simple goal: to increase the number of people applying to study Computer Science at Cambridge. By putting cheap, programmable computers in the hands of the right young people, we hoped that we might revive some of the sense of excitement about computing that we had back in the 1980s with our Sinclair Spectrums, BBC Micros and Commodore 64s. At the time, we thought our lifetime volumes might amount to ten thousand units  if we were lucky. There was was no expectation that adults would use Raspberry Pi, no expectation of commercial success, and certainly no expectation that four years later we would be manufacturing tens of thousands of units a day in the UK, and exporting Raspberry Pi all over the world."</em> <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/ten-millionth-raspberry-pi-new-kit/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Identifying which genes cause autism is challenging, but a new tool may point researchers in the right direction. Scientists at the Simons Foundation and Princeton University have developed a computational technique that can sift through more than 25,000 genes in the human genome and rank them based on the probability that they are associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The tool identified hundreds of previously unreported candidate autism risk genes, along with networks, cellular functions and developmental stages of the brain that play a role in ASD. The tool could work for almost any complex disease, the authors say in their Nature Neuroscience paper published online August 1."</em> <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/autism-research-initiative/new-tool-predicts-autism-risk-genes/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"University of California, Berkeley engineers have built the first dust-sized, wireless sensors that can be implanted in the body, bringing closer the day when a Fitbit-like device could monitor internal nerves, muscles or organs in real time. Because these batteryless sensors could also be used to stimulate nerves and muscles, the technology also opens the door to electroceuticals to treat disorders such as epilepsy or to stimulate the immune system or tamp down inflammation. The so-called neural dust, which the team implanted in the muscles and peripheral nerves of rats, is unique in that ultrasound is used both to power and read out the measurements. Ultrasound technology is already well-developed for hospital use, and ultrasound vibrations can penetrate nearly anywhere in the body, unlike radio waves, the researchers say."</em> <a href="http://news.berkeley.edu/2016/08/03/sprinkling-of-neural-dust-opens-door-to-electroceuticals/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Diodes are the traffic lights of electrical devices: they determine whether or not electricity is able to pass through a circuit. Chip manufacturers strive to make them as small as possible, so that they can fit the maximum possible amount of components on a chip. When the lights are green, the diodes need to ensure a good flow of traffic, but they also need to ensure that as little electricity as possible can jump the lights when they are red. TU Delft researchers have successfully manufactured a diode using just a single molecule. At 600, this diodes ratio of red to green (in technical jargon: its rectification ratio) is significantly higher than in earlier research (15). The researchers were also able to make the diode tuneable for the first time. They recently published their research in the international journal Nanoscale."</em> <a href="http://www.tudelft.nl/en/current/latest-news/article/detail/efficiente-stroomstoplichtjes-van-slechts-een-molecuul-2/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Had one too many to drink and need to know if youre OK to drive home? You might one day be able to stick an electronic tattoo on your arm to tell you. Researchers have made a disposable tattoo-based device that can accurately measure alcohol levels in sweat and relay the results wirelessly to your phone or smart watch. Blood alcohol concentration is the most accurate way to verify if someone is drunk. Measuring it requires a finger prick, though, so its used by law enforcement in extreme cases. Breathalyzers are less invasive, but they can give false positives and can be spoofed easily, says Patrick Mercier, an electrical and computer engineering professor at University of California, San Diego. One rinse with mouthwash can throw them off, he adds."</em> <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/the-human-os/biomedical/devices/temporary-tattoo-keeps-tab-on-alcohol-intake">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/PulseSim-Photoplethysmograph-Heartbeat-Analog-Simu/">PulseSim - Photoplethysmograph (Heartbeat) Analog Simulator</a></h2>

<p><em>"The volume of blood in our fingers changes at different parts of the cardiac cycle (heartbeat). Immediately following ventricular contraction (when the heart pumps blood out of the ventricles and to the rest of the body), the volume of blood in the fingers increases slightly. This change in blood volume can be measured using finger photoplethysmography. In this technique, an LED shines light through a person's finger and a photodiode measures the amount of light that passes through the finger. The amount of light that hits the photodiode will change due to the change in blood volume in the finger. Interestingly enough, if we plot intensity of light vs time, we get a very characteristic waveform (here and here). The initial sharp rise of our pulse waveform indicates the systolic phase (aotric and ventricular contraction). The smaller secondary peak occurs due to the closure of the aortic valve at the end of the cardiac cycle. This smaller peak is called the dicrotic notch. In this Instructable, I will show you how to recreate the pulse waveform using basic circuit components (resistors, capacitors, transistors, and op amps) without the use of a microcontroller. I didn't have much inspiration for doing this other than I love finding excuses to play with circuits and I just wanted to see if I could do it. ;) I thought about putting it together a little more to make it some sort of educational tool.

Seven years ago I posted DIY ECG Machine on the Cheap which showed a discernible ECG I obtained using an op-amp, two resistors, and a capacitor outputting to a PC sound cards microphone input. It didnt work well, but the fact that it worked at all was impressive! It has been one of the most popular posts of my website ever since, and I get 1-2 emails a month from people trying to recreate these results (some of them are during the last week of a college design course and sound pretty desperate). Sometimes people get good results with that old circuit, but more often than not the output isnt what people expected. I decided to revisit this project (with more patience and experience under my belt) and see if I could improve it. My goal was not to create the highest quality ECG machine I could, but rather to create the simplest one I could with emphasis on predictable and reproducible results. The finished project is a blend of improved hardware and custom cross-platform open-source software (which runs on Windows, Linux, and MacOS), and an impressively good ECG considering the circuit is so simple and runs on a breadboard!

<p><em>"Projects I build often involve frequency synthesis, and one of the most useful tools to have around is a good frequency counter. Being a budding programmer and data analysis guru, I love the idea of being able to access / log / analyze frequency readings on my computer too. Commercial frequency counters can be large, expensive, and their calibration is a chicken-and-egg problem (you need a calibrated frequency counter to calibrate a frequency reference you use to calibrate a frequency counter!). For about the cost of a latte I made a surprisingly good frequency frequency counter (which directly counts >100 MHz without dividing-down the input signal) by blending a SN74LV8154 dual 16-bit counter (which can double as a 32-bit counter, $1.04 on mouser) and an ATMega328 microcontroller ($3.37 on Mouser). Although these two chips are all you need to count something, the accuracy of your counts depend on your gate. If you can generate a signal of 1 pulse per second (1PPS), you can count anything, but your accuracy depends on the accuracy of your 1PPS signal. To eliminate the need for calibration (and to provide the 1PPS signal with the accuracy of an atomic clock) Im utilizing the 1PPS signal originating from a GPS unit which I already had distributed throughout my shack (using a 74HC240 IC as a line driver). If you dont have a GPS unit, consider getting one! Im using a NEO-6M module ($17.66 on Amazon) to generate the 1PPS gate, and if you include its cost were up to $22.07. Also, all of the code for this project (schematics, C that runs on the microcontroller, and a Python to interact with the serial port) is shared on GitHub! You may be wondering, why do GPS units have incredibly accurate 1PPS signals? Its a good question, but a subject for another day. For now, trust me when I say theyre fantastically accurate (but slightly less precise due to jitter) if youre interested in learning more read up on GPS timing."</em> <a href="http://www.swharden.com/wp/2016-09-05-vhf-frequency-counter-with-pc-interface/">[...]</a></p>

It is primarily used in daily forecasts aimed at the general public, and is increasingly available as an hourly forecast as well. The UV Index is designed as an open-ended linear scale, directly proportional to the intensity of UV radiation that causes sunburn on human skin. For example, if a light-skinned individual (without sunscreen or a suntan) begins to sunburn in 30 minutes at UV Index 6, then that individual should expect to sunburn in about 15 minutes at UV Index 12  twice the UV, twice as fast."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-UV-Meter-With-Arduino-and-a-Nokia-5110-Display/">[...]</a></p>
