<p>Esta semana foi atingido um novo recorde de envio massivo de informação à distância através de ondas de rádio. Foi enviado o equivalente ao conteúdo de um DVD em menos de 10 segundos a uma distância de 37 Kms. A Intel fez a aquisição da empresa Itseez Inc especializada em Software de visão de computador para IoT e carros auto-conduzidos. Foi igualmente esta semana que foi posto um ponto final na conjectura de Kelmans-Seymour, feita à 40 anos e apenas provada agora. Trata-se de uma conjectura no âmbito da teoria dos Grafos. Foi construído, no Dubai o primeiro edifício impresso em 3D.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. Na rubrica "Documentação" apresentamos oito livros (eBooks) que podem ser descarregados livremente e que esta semana são sobre
Lições em Circuitos Eléctricos - DC, AC, Semicondutores, Circuitos Digitais, Referencia e Experiências,  um sobre Álgebra para iniciados e intermédia e outro sobre introdução ao Windows 10 para Profissionais de IT. Foi também publicada a revista newelectronics de 23 de Maio.</p>

<p><em>"Transmitting the contents of a conventional DVD in under ten seconds by radio transmission is incredibly fast – and a new world record in wireless data transmission. With a data rate of 6 Gigabit per second over a distance of 37 kilometers, a collaborative project with the parti­ci­pa­tion of researchers from the University of Stuttgart and the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Solid State Physics IAF exceeded the state of the art by a factor of 10. The collaborative project ACCESS (Advanced E Band Satellite Link Studies) was carried out by a research group headed by Professor Ingmar Kallfass from the Institute of Robust Power Semiconductor Systems (ILH) from the University of Stuttgart, the Institut für Hochfrequenztechnik und Elektronik (IHE) from KIT, Radiometer Physics GmbH, and the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Solid State Physics IAF."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"Intel is transforming from a PC company to a company that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected computing devices. These devices will use the power of Intel technology to process data being generated from “things,” connect to and learn from data being analyzed in the cloud, and deliver amazing new experiences. One of the amazing Internet of Things (IoT) experiences Intel is gearing up to deliver is autonomous driving. Americans spend some 75 billion hours a year driving. Morgan Stanley estimates that self-driving vehicles could deliver $507 billion in annual productivity gains – to cite just one compelling benefit. While the possibilities are exciting, the reality requires solving a myriad of technology challenges. Solutions will need to seamlessly deliver a combination of compute, connectivity, security, machine learning, human machine interfaces and functional safety. To win in automotive today and help deliver its exciting future, Intel is adding new capabilities to our automotive portfolio like functional safety and over-the-air software management. Another key requirement for self-driving cars is the ability to see and accurately interpret surroundings. One of the technologies necessary to support this capability is computer vision."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"This may sound like a familiar kind of riddle: How many brilliant mathematicians does it take to come up with and prove the Kelmans-Seymour Conjecture? But the answer is no joke, because arriving at it took mental toil that spanned four decades until this year, when mathematicians at the Georgia Institute of Technology finally announced a proof of that conjecture in Graph Theory."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum inaugurated the first 3D printed office. The building is the first of its kind in the world prepared for actual use, taken into account the integration of a unique building design and 3D-printing technology to offer key services within the building, such as electricity, water, telecommunications and air-conditioning. The office space covers up to 250 square meters, while the exterior design reflects the most innovative forms of future work place. The design has been conceived to achieve a shift from the traditional form of work environments and provide greater opportunities to stimulate innovation and communication between work place teams. It also offers the possibilities for joint work with experts and innovators from around the world, and a platform to inspire ideas and develop relations between employees by establishing new methods for brainstorming sessions and creating a healthy and happy environment. The design also offers space for exhibitions and workshops as well as other events."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT56_RealTimeBehaviourSynthesisForD.jpg" alt="CT56_RealTimeBehaviourSynthesisForD" /></p>

<p><em>"Dexterous hand manipulation is one of the most complex types of biological movement, and has proven very difficult to replicate in robots. The usual approaches to robotic control - following pre-defined trajectories or planning online with reduced models - are both inapplicable. Dexterous manipulation is so sensitive to small variations in contact force and object location that it seems to require online planning without any simplifications. Here we demonstrate for the first time online planning (or model-predictive control) with a full physics model of a humanoid hand, with 28 degrees of freedom and 48 pneumatic actuators. We augment the actuation space with motor synergies which speed up optimization without removing flexibility. Most of our results are in simulation, showing nonprehensile object manipulation as well as typing. In both cases the input to the system is a high level task description, while all details of the hand movement emerge online from fully automated numerical optimization. We also show preliminary results on a hardware platform we have developed "ADROIT" - a ShadowHand skeleton equipped with faster and more compliant actuation."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"In experiments involving a simulation of the human esophagus and stomach, researchers at MIT, the University of Sheffield, and the Tokyo Institute of Technology have demonstrated a tiny origami robot that can unfold itself from a swallowed capsule and, steered by external magnetic fields, crawl across the stomach wall to remove a swallowed button battery or patch a wound. The new work, which the researchers are presenting this week at the International Conference on Robotics and Automation, builds on a long sequence of papers on origami robots from the research group of Daniela Rus, the Andrew and Erna Viterbi Professor in MIT's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"For the first time, scientists at IBM (NYSE: IBM) Research have demonstrated reliably storing 3 bits of data per cell using a relatively new memory technology known as phase-change memory (PCM). The current memory landscape spans from venerable DRAM to hard disk drives to ubiquitous flash. But in the last several years PCM has attracted the industry's attention as a potential universal memory technology based on its combination of read/write speed, endurance, non-volatility and density. For example, PCM doesn't lose data when powered off, unlike DRAM, and the technology can endure at least 10 million write cycles, compared to an average flash USB stick, which tops out at 3,000 write cycles.

<p><img src="CT56_PrintingMetalInMidair.jpg" alt="CT56_PrintingMetalInMidair" /></p>

<p><em>"'Flat' and 'rigid' are terms typically used to describe electronic devices. But the increasing demand for flexible, wearable electronics, sensors, antennas and biomedical devices has led a team at Harvard's Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering and John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) to innovate an eye-popping new way of printing complex metallic architectures - as though they are seemingly suspended in midair. Reported online May 16 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, this laser-assisted direct ink writing method allows microscopic metallic, free-standing 3D structures to be printed in one step without auxiliary support material. The research was led by Wyss Core Faculty member Jennifer Lewis, Sc.D., who is also the Hansjörg Wyss Professor of Biologically Inspired Engineering at SEAS."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT56_NewMethodOfProducingRandomNumb.jpg" alt="CT56_NewMethodOfProducingRandomNumb" /></p>

<p><em>"With an advance that one cryptography expert called a "masterpiece," University of Texas at Austin computer scientists have developed a new method for producing truly random numbers, a breakthrough that could be used to encrypt data, make electronic voting more secure, conduct statistically significant polls and more accurately simulate complex systems such as Earth's climate. The new method creates truly random numbers with less computational effort than other methods, which could facilitate significantly higher levels of security for everything from consumer credit card transactions to military communications. Computer science professor David Zuckerman and graduate student Eshan Chattopadhyay will present research about their method in June at the annual Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC), the Association for Computing Machinery's premier theoretical computer science conference. An invitation to present at the conference is based on a rigorous peer review process to evaluate the work's correctness and significance. Their paper will be one of three receiving the STOC Best Paper Award."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"We envision a machine-driven evolution of human body form and function, where the programmable nature of machines plays a crucial role. Robotic joints worn on the wrist turn into extra fingers so that a person acquires skills beyond what five fingers can offer, or performs 'tri-manual' tasks with the machine joints."</em></p></li>

<p>Com a disponibilidade de ferramentas que permitem dar azo a nossa imaginação na criação de peças 3D e espaços como o <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/">thingiverse</a> para as publicar, esta rubrica apresenta alguns modelos selecionados que poderão ser úteis.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1572431">Fully Functional 3D Printed Vise</a></h2>

<p><img src="MP56_FullyFunctional3DPrintedVise.jpg" alt="MP56_FullyFunctional3DPrintedVise" /></p>

<p>This is a 3D printed model of a functioning vise!</p>

<p>NOTE: I created this print to lightly hold electronic components while soldering, etc. It's not designed for, and should not be used for rigorous clamping force. This is a plastic model of a vice, not a real vice, and should be used according. As noted by user DevWolf in the comment section, PLA plastic is very rigid and can break under stress in unpredictable ways creating shrapnel like pieces that can cause injury.</p>

<p>This model has tight tolerances and may require a bit of sanding or cleanup at the end to fit together properly, depending on your printer, filament, etc.</p>

<p>I also used Simplify 3D to slice the model and generate supports, so results with other programs will vary.</p>

<p>I began with a base model provided by Tom over at the Ox Tools YouTube channel (links below) of his Wilton Baby Bullet vise. Originally it was designed to be machined out of metal, so I took the CAD files and modified them to be 3D printable, and finished the work that would normally occur during the machining process. I also worked to optimize it for better printing.</p>

<p>You can see a video of how this model was put together, as well as see it in action over on my YouTube channel (as well as lots of other projects): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZy8RGfQPGo</p>

<p>Be sure to upload a picture if you print or modify a version, I'd love to see the results!</p>

<p>See print setting for printing tips.</p>

<p>Special thanks to Tom over at Ox tools for sharing the original model and allowing me to share it as well, and for the documenting the build of the real metal version of this vise!</p>

<p>You can find his info below:

<p><em>"The ESP8266 is a awesome chip; with integrated WiFi, 80MHz clock speed, total 160kb RAM, 512kb of flash memory, and a ton of other features, it makes a regular Arduino look like a joke. The project shown in this Instructable is based solely on the ESP8266-01 module, unlike several other projects on the web where it is used in tandem with another microcontroller. This makes it great demonstration of the capabilities of the ESP chip."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="PM56_HowToMeasureTemperatureVeryAcc.jpg" alt="PM56_HowToMeasureTemperatureVeryAcc" /></p>

<p><em>"While studying in university we were challenged as part of a course work into designing a box with very accurate temperature control. If the project were to succeed, multiple boxes were to be built and used in a research project studying the effect of surface material on the perceived temperature of flooring and other building materials. The project was deemed as very challenging by the university staff because the temperature inside the boxes should stay within  0.1C of the desired value. Therefore we would require the most accurate temperature sensor we could find. On one hand, the sensor should be factory calibrated to the desired temperature, because calibrating to within 0.1C of the national temperature standard is next to impossible on a simple setup of boiling and freezing water. On the other hand, an analog temperature sensor with a proclaimed accuracy of  0.1C might still produce inaccurate results after the value is converted to a digital value by an ADC (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter)."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="PM56_WifiControlledGardenLightWithE.jpg" alt="PM56_WifiControlledGardenLightWithE" /></p>

<p><em>"I've got a bit of a thing for lights and being able to remotely control them. I particularly like this in the garden and even better if i can solar power them. I have some of the pound/dollar store stake lights but they are rather weak so i started to look around and found that the dollar/pound store also sold small pillar lights that i would be able to repurpose. I then stripped it down and retro fitted three 1w LED's and a ESP8266 wifi micro controller which shall allow me to control the light remotely either manually or via timer/events. The board i purchased can take 5 but on working out the voltage i would need more than 12v to drive them at full brightness and i didn't want to have to setup up the voltage as that would require another component so i settled on 3 which works nicely, i bridged two of the LED positions as they are in series so leaving them connected wasn't an option. I am using a dedicated Led driver board as these 1w led's must only be driven with 350ma of current, the beauty of this board is that it will increase the foward voltage if you increase extra LED's upto a maximum of 10. It must be noted however that each led shall take 3.3v so if you are planning on running 10 LED's then you shall require an input voltage of 33v, just below the units 35v rated maximum. As we are driving 3 LED's which require at least 9.9v which works great with out 12v supply. The other great feature of this board is that it has a pwm connection so that you can vary the brightness of the light by connecting it to a PWM pin on a microcontroller and sending the correct signal. This is excellent as it negates the need for any other hardware bar a step down converter to get 3.3v for the ESP 8266 board."</em></p></li>

I do apologize for the English as it is not my native language. Remarks are highly appreciated. Since I discovered Intructables.com, I began to play with Arduino and robotic. From my educational background, I have some knowledge about Artificial Intelligence. So I thought it would be nice to put them together. Little by little, the idea to build a robot, based on some ATTINY processor and programmed using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), began to blossom in my mind. I settled for an Avoiding Collision Turtle robot powered by a Fixed ANN. Later on, I will add a self-learning module using a Raspberry-Pi to train the ANN implemented here (Perhaps a next instructable?).

<p><em>"This scale is wireless. It may be useful where you can't operate a normal scale, due to the weather outside, or if you don't want to scare birds or other creatures away. With this scale you can weigh them. In this instructable, I used a 0 to 1 Kg load cell since I wanted to weigh hummingbirds and orioles that visited our nectar feeder. One end of the load cell was attached to the eaves, and the other end has a hook from which the support string for the feeder hangs. Many other load cells are available in different weight ranges, and they all can be hooked up the same way, the only difference being the zero factor and range factor which can be changed in the Arduino sketch."</em></p></li>

And one thing that's always a little tricky is lighting, especially if you'd like to photograph something in the evening. If it's kind of dark, then most photos and videos can get an orangy color and it just doesn't look very crisp. Also, if you're on the go and you're not in control of the setting, lighting can often be problematic.

<p><em>"Some time ago i bought a nice 5V switching mode PSU to have enough power for a raspberry and all stuff in want to connect to it. In another instructable i wrote some time ago, i showed how i like to wire it up to have safe and durable connections - even for my breadboard setups - and do not actually need to really care about them to much any longer. ( You can find this instructable over here if you are curious. ) Well, i even wanted to have some measuring on how many volts my PSU actually delivers and how many ampere all this stuff consumes. For this purpose, i just bought a cheapo led meter which can measure from 0 to 100 volts and from 0 to 10 ampere. Additionally it needs a power supply which can deliver anything between 4.5 and 30 volts."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"The idea of being able to hide a transmitter in a pen is very appealing. In an effort to reduce the size of this design, we have used surface-mount components. Firstly, the thought of using the coil in the tank circuit for transmitting RF was a little far fetched, but we used it as an example for those who were interested in experimenting with our circuits. Now we have gone back to a conventional antenna, the whip. The whip or straight-line antenna can be coiled, wound longitudinally or folded. The way it is wound makes a big difference to its effectiveness, but when you are limited in space, you have to accept these limitations. Even though we have used this antenna set up in our previous pen bugs we have considerably improved the circuit to the point were it has low battery consumption, but high RF output. The size of this design has been reduced considerably by using surface-mount components."</em></p></li>

Light can be converted to DC current with solar panels, electricity can be converted to magnetism as I did in my last article, in a microphone sound waves are converted to an electrical signal (by vibrating a magnet near a coil), solar rays can even be focused and converted to heat in awesome devices like this! When we think about it, energy is all around us and can be harvested in an enumerable many of ways. Today, we are going to take a rather novel approach. We are going to build a device specifically designed to sense and capture a particular band of energy which is all around us. The earth is magnetic and anyone who has ever used a compass knows this. Magnetic bodies in motion produce electricity, we can see this in any alternator, like the one in your car. So, therefore the earth is electric as well as magnetic, by definition. "</em></p></li>

By using this system you will be able to unlock a door for 5 seconds. After 5 seconds the electrical door opener will be automatically be locked. You can unlock it by typing the correct password and pressing the '*' button. If you want to change the current password, you can do it by pressing the 'A' button and if you want to skip or abord an operation you can do it by pressing the '#' button. It also has a buzzer for making various tones during operation."</em></p></li>

It was not easy to work with this module as the pins are not breadboard friendly or PCB friendly. I had to build a custom dev board to test it out. I could not afford to buy a ready to use ESP8266 dev board, as these are very expensive, in India. And there is no fun in it. To get started with this module, I had to pick information from several post/blogs etc. In this instructable I will consolidate all info, issues and their solutions, I discovered during build and testing."</em></p></li>
