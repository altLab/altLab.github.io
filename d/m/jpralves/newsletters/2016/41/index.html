<p>Esta semana ficámos a saber que uma teoria de Einstein com cerca de 100 anos, relacionada com a teoria da Relatividade, sobre as ondas gravitacionais foi confirmada através da observação das mesmas por parte de cientistas do LIGO. Uma criança de 3 anos da Irlanda no Norte foi a primeira no mundo a receber um rim de um dador adulto com recurso a impressão 3D. Um reputado especialista em segurança - Bruce Schneier - escreveu um artigo onde equipara a IoT ao maior Robot do mundo. Por fim, a STmicroelectronics lançou uma plataforma open-source para ser usada em sistemas Linux para desenvolvimento de soluções embebidas baseadas em STM32.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker e na rubrica "Documentação" apresentamos quatro livros (eBooks) que podem ser descarregados livremente e que esta semana são sobre introdução ao Java, programação em C, um livro para administração de sistemas Linux baseados em Debian e um livro sobre HTML5 e as suas novidades. Sob a alçada a MagPI são apresentados também dois livros, um sobre a linha de comandos e outro sobre sensores em Raspberry Pi. Saiu estava semana a revista Hispabrick 24 e a newelectronics de 9 de Fevereiro.</p>

<p><img src="NS41_GravitationalWavesDetected100Y.jpg" alt="NS41_GravitationalWavesDetected100Y" /></p>

<p><em>"For the first time, scientists have observed ripples in the fabric of spacetime called gravitational waves, arriving at the earth from a cataclysmic event in the distant universe. This confirms a major prediction of Albert Einstein’s 1915 general theory of relativity and opens an unprecedented new window onto the cosmos. Gravitational waves carry information about their dramatic origins and about the nature of gravity that cannot otherwise be obtained. Physicists have concluded that the detected gravitational waves were produced during the final fraction of a second of the merger of two black holes to produce a single, more massive spinning black hole. This collision of two black holes had been predicted but never observed."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="NS41_NorthernIrelandToddlerLucyBouc.jpg" alt="NS41_NorthernIrelandToddlerLucyBouc" /></p>

<p><em>"A three-year-old girl from Northern Ireland has become the first in the world to have a life-changing kidney transplant using 3D printing. It is the first time in the world that 3D printing has been used to aid kidney transplant surgery involving an adult donor and a child recipient. Lucy Boucher, from Antrim in Northern Ireland suffered heart failure as a baby when she developed supraventricular tachycardia - meaning her heart was beating irregularly faster than normal. This resulted in her body, including her kidneys, being starved of oxygen."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/02/the_internet_of_1.html">The Internet of Things Will Be the World's Biggest Robot</a></p>

<p><img src="NS41_TheInternetOfThingsWillBeTheWo.jpg" alt="NS41_TheInternetOfThingsWillBeTheWo" /></p>

<p><em>"The Internet of Things is the name given to the computerization of everything in our lives. Already you can buy Internet-enabled thermostats, light bulbs, refrigerators, and cars. Soon everything will be on the Internet: the things we own, the things we interact with in public, autonomous things that interact with each other. These "things" will have two separate parts. One part will be sensors that collect data about us and our environment. Already our smartphones know our location and, with their onboard accelerometers, track our movements. Things like our thermostats and light bulbs will know who is in the room. Internet-enabled street and highway sensors will know how many people are out and about­ -- and eventually who they are. Sensors will collect environmental data from all over the world. The other part will be actuators. They'll affect our environment. Our smart thermostats aren't collecting information about ambient temperature and who's in the room for nothing; they set the temperature accordingly. Phones already know our location, and send that information back to Google Maps and Waze to determine where traffic congestion is; when they're linked to driverless cars, they'll automatically route us around that congestion. Amazon already wants autonomous drones to deliver packages. The Internet of Things will increasingly perform actions for us and in our name."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="NS41_StmicroelectronicsAttractsLinu.jpg" alt="NS41_StmicroelectronicsAttractsLinu" /></p>

<p><em>"STMicroelectronics (NYSE: STM), a global semiconductor leader serving customers across the spectrum of electronics applications, has extended opportunities to design free of charge with its popular STM32 microcontrollers for Linux system users including professional engineers, academics, and hobbyists. Most Linux distributions are free, and open-source application software makes the Linux world attractive to technology enthusiasts. Until now, however, most development tools for embedded computing have been available only for Windows® PCs. The STM32CubeMX configurator and initialization tool and the System Workbench® for STM32, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) created by Ac6 Tools, supported by the openSTM32.org community, and available at www.st.com/sw4stm32, are now both available to run on Linux OS."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT41_NewNanomanufacturingTechniqueA.jpg" alt="CT41_NewNanomanufacturingTechniqueA" /></p>

<p><em>"More than a decade ago, theorists predicted the possibility of a nanolens—a chain of three nanoscale spheres that would focus incoming light into a spot much smaller than possible with conventional microscopy. Such a device would make possible extremely high-resolution imaging or biological sensing. But scientists had been unable to build and arrange many nanolenses over a large area."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT41_LightChipsCouldMeanMoreEnergyE.jpg" alt="CT41_LightChipsCouldMeanMoreEnergyE" /></p>

<p><em>"A microprocessor that uses optical connections instead of electrical wires to shuttle data around has long been the dream of chip designers, but the attempt to fabricate one has frustrated them for years. Now a prototype described in the journal Nature offers a promising and practical approach. The electronic-optical microprocessor, developed by a group of researchers at MIT, the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Colorado, Boulder, integrates over 70 million transistors and 850 optical components. The system uses optical fibers, transmitters, and receivers to send data between a processor chip and a memory chip. In a demo, it runs a graphics program to display and manipulate a 3-D image, a task that requires using the internal optical connections to fetch data from memory and run instructions."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.nanolett.5b04221">Cellular Cargo Delivery: Toward Assisted Fertilization by Sperm-Carrying Micromotors</a></p>

<p><img src="CT41_CellularCargoDeliveryTowardAss.jpg" alt="CT41_CellularCargoDeliveryTowardAss" /></p>

<p><em>"We present artificially motorized sperm cells—a novel type of hybrid micromotor, where customized microhelices serve as motors for transporting sperm cells with motion deficiencies to help them carry out their natural function. Our results indicate that metal-coated polymer microhelices are suitable for this task due to potent, controllable, and nonharmful 3D motion behavior. We manage to capture, transport, and release single immotile live sperm cells in fluidic channels that allow mimicking physiological conditions. Important steps toward fertilization are addressed by employing proper means of sperm selection and oocyte culturing. Despite the fact that there still remain some challenges on the way to achieve successful fertilization with artificially motorized sperms, we believe that the potential of this novel approach toward assisted reproduction can be already put into perspective with the present work."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"WELCOME TO the Seventh Edition of Introduction to Programming Using Java, a free, on-line textbook on introductory programming, which uses Java as the language of instruction. This book is directed mainly towards beginning programmers, although it might also be useful for experienced programmers who want to learn something about Java. It is certainly not meant to provide complete coverage of the Java language."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/C_Programming.pdf">C Programming</a></p>

<p><em>"C Programming is a tutorial teaching the C programming language. C is the most commonly used programming language for writing operating systems. Not only is C a popular language for operating systems, it is the precursor and inspiration for almost all of the most popular high-level languages available today. In fact, Perl, PHP, Python and Java are all written in C. C++, a common object-oriented language, was originally implemented as a preprocessor to C. C is also used in microcontroller programming because of it's easy access to the hardware through pointers. C is renowned for it's efficiency and portability, while still allowing this low-level access."</em></p></li>

<h1 id="Modelos-3D">Modelos 3D <a href="#topo">^</a></h1>

<p>Com a disponibilidade de ferramentas que permitem dar azo a nossa imaginação na criação de peças 3D e espaços como o <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/">thingiverse</a> para as publicar, esta rubrica apresenta alguns modelos selecionados que poderão ser úteis.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1316060">Bit Handle</a></h2>

<p><img src="MP41_BitHandle.jpg" alt="MP41_BitHandle" /></p>

<p>Simple low profile bit holder, if you have fit issues scale the STL up or down.</p>

<p>Based on my T handle for hex keys seen here.
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:951909</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1271778">Custom tool holder for pegboard</a></h2>

<p><img src="MP41_CustomToolHolderForPegboard.jpg" alt="MP41_CustomToolHolderForPegboard" /></p>

<p>This is a simple and somewhat customized (screw holes, tool holes, number of tool holes) tool holder for pegboards. Instead of relying in the strength of plastic to stay in place, it uses 90-degree screws that confers it a lot more resistance.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1264391">The Ultimate box maker</a></h2>

<p><img src="MP41_TheUltimateBoxMaker.jpg" alt="MP41_TheUltimateBoxMaker" /></p>

<p>My first try with OpenScad,
the box is fully customizable.
I hope you will enjoy with it, and show us many boxes made with.</p>

<p>If you play with the Round value you will go from the sharp to the round sides box
If you want a chanfered box, set Resolution to 1.</p>

<p>To export each single pieces, just set the other to "NO" value.
The Top and Bottom Shells are the same,
so it's not necessary to export them two times.</p>

<p>Check the animation below to see how to setup your own box.</p>

<p>You can change the text shape with any font listed here .</p>

<p>Have fun ;)</p>

<p><img src="PM41_AudioinoTheArduinoWithAudioBoo.jpg" alt="PM41_AudioinoTheArduinoWithAudioBoo" /></p>

<p><em>"For a long time I was building little microcontroller circuits which played with leds, make sounds or controlled little robots. I was always looking for a low cost circuit to program my gadgets because I like to give some of them to my friends as a present and I wanted to enable the people to download new programs to this gadgets. Imagine if you build a simple low cost led gadget which produces some light patterns. After a while you would become bored about the  patterns the gadget produces. How nice would it be to download some new patterns? To do this, you need a bootloader in the microcontroller. The bootloader described in this article might be used to build a kind of “low cost” Arduino for daily use when you don't want to spend the money for a real Arduino but to be able to simply reprogram your circuit. I call it Audioino because it can be programmed from the audio line of a PC."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"In early 2010, we published a set of rudimentary routines to link graphing calculators to Arduino boards. In the intervening four years, a number of developers have given me feedback on the routines, including features that they'd like to see and improvements that could be made. Those improvements have made their way into a new library called ArTICL (Arduino-TI Calculator Linking). Like any good Arduino library, it contains a set of classes you can use in your own Arduino programs, plus a handful examples made by yours truly and other Cemetech members. We plan to continue to expand the library and eventually create one or more lesson plans that teachers could use to teach rudimentary electronics and programming with TI-83 Plus or TI-84 Plus calculators and Arduinos."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"Create your own rc controlled led-strip for individual room illumination! Most rgb-led-strips are controlled by an infrared remote control. To turn it off or on or change the color, you have to stay in front of the receiver. This is boring and not really smart. To control the light in a cooler way, i developed a rc controlled board to set the right color of the strip. The rc code can be send from a raspberry pi, think of IFTTT. That's a lot smarter than the ir remote control."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"Searching in others Instructables I found many ways to control EL Wire with arduino but not all were like I wanted, so I decided to create my own version, maybe is not perfect but works. This EL Wire Module controlling 10 mts of EL Wire in two sections, 1 section for 5 mts and section 2 for the other 5 mts, You will need two EL Wire pocket inverters 3v, and need make a little modify to get it working with the module."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"This project is what I would like to think of as a successful failure. I have been working on a low resolution LED clock for the past few weeks and in the end, I regretfully overpowered my Arduino UNO - causing it to fry as well as burn out my LEDs. However, I did accomplish quite a bit and will share my process so that maybe someone can learn from my mistakes."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"I always thought the clapper so cool. For those who are lazy like me, turn on or off the bedroom light without getting out of bed, simple clap your hands is amazing. Thinking about it I projected one for me. Several projects of clappers can be found on the Internet, and most of them do not use microcontroller. I chose to use a micro planning future updates, such as turn on or off the light with 2 claps, the TV with 3 claps, DVD player with 4 and so on. Another update can be a time to turn off the device automatically."</em></p></li>

This chip is no longer manufactured by Panasonic and finding replacement chip for AN6877 is also quiet difficult. The circuit described in this article is design to replace AN6877 base LED drivers and it is based on commonly available components. This replacement LED driver is design using 10, MMBT3904/2N3904 transistors and it can easily modify to get necessary number of outputs."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"Hi all! After some time out, due some hard work, I’m here again with a ‘one weekend’ project (in my case, with three childs. Sure it can be done in one afternoon!). I want to start some projects with Arduino and IoT, so the first things I need is an Arduino board, an Ethernet shield and a switch to connect it to the net. Also I need a power supply for the Arduino board, and I think that, better than a external USB AC wall adaptor or power supply, is modify the switch to add it a USB power port that can power the Arduino board. I’ve got at home a TP-Link TL-SF1008D, a simple 8 port 10/100 Mbps switch. So, let’s go to open it and add it the USB port!"</em></p></li>

That video showed a hand drawn circuit diagram that looked simple so I decided to build one. Actually, I ended up building a few. This instructable will demonstrate two of the circuits I made. One is just the basic design and the other is two circuits wired in series with a push button to control an led. I connect the circuits to my house ground and an antenna that was already mounted to the top of my house. The antenna was not being used and had been there since I moved in years ago."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"One of the first projects I did with an Arduino was a Christmas lights garland. In fact, it was made of a simple RGB LED strip cut in two, as Arduino has only 6 hardware PWM outputs. I didn’t want it to display trivial rainbows and random colors – after all, a Chinese controller that came with the strip was pretty capable of doing that – I wanted it to show something meaningful. Like time and outside temperature. As an RGB strip can show only one color at a time it is effectively a single RGB LED multiplied many times, so my task was basically to invent some way of showing information on a single RGB LED – hence the OnePixel working title."</em></p></li>
