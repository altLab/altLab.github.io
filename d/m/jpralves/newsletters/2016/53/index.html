<p><em>"An unexpected discovery has led to a rechargeable battery that's as inexpensive as conventional car batteries, but has a much higher energy density. The new battery could become a cost-effective, environmentally friendly alternative for storing renewable energy and supporting the power grid. A team based at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory identified this energy storage gem after realizing the new battery works in a different way than they had assumed. The journal Nature Energy published a paper today that describes the battery."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"In the near future this device could provide a means of generating much needed electricity to remote areas at very little cost, each device costs just £1-£2. With growing global pressures to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and the associated greenhouse gas emissions, microbial fuel cells could be an exciting alternative. A microbial fuel cell is a device that uses natural biological processes of ‘electric’ bacteria to turn organic matter, such as urine, into electricity. These fuel cells are efficient and relatively cheap to run, and produce nearly zero waste compared to other methods of electricity generation. In practice, urine will pass through the microbial fuel cell for the reaction to happen. From here, electricity is generated by the bacteria which can then be stored or used to directly power electrical devices."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"Polymer semiconductors, which can be processed on large-area and mechanically flexible substrates with low cost, are considered as one of the main components for future plastic electronics. However, they, especially n-type semiconducting polymers, currently lag behind inorganic counterparts in the charge carrier mobility – which characterizes how quickly charge carriers (electron) can move inside a semiconductor – and the chemical stability in ambient air. Recently, a joint research team, consisting of Prof. Kilwon Cho and Dr. Boseok Kang (Dept. of Chemical Engineering, POSTECH), and Prof. Yun-Hi Kim and Dr. Ran Kim (Dept. of Chemistry, Gyungsang National University), has developed a new n-type semiconducting polymer with superior electron mobility and oxidative stability. The research outcome was published in Journal of the American Chemical Society (JACS) as a cover article and highlighted by the editors in JACS Spotlights."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT53_StanfordResearchersCreateSuper.jpg" alt="CT53_StanfordResearchersCreateSuper" /></p>

<p><em>"If there’s such a thing as an experiment that goes too well, a recent effort in the lab of Stanford chemical engineering Professor Zhenan Bao might fit the bill. One of her team members, Cheng-Hui Li, wanted to test the stretchiness of a rubberlike type of plastic known as an elastomer that he had just synthesized. Such materials can normally be stretched two or three times their original length and spring back to original size. One common stress test involves stretching an elastomer beyond this point until it snaps. But Li, a visiting scholar from China, hit a snag: The clamping machine typically used to measure elasticity could only stretch about 45 inches. To find the breaking point of their one-inch sample, Li and another lab member had to hold opposing ends in their hands, standing further and further apart, eventually stretching a 1-inch polymer film to more than 100 inches."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"Your laptop's battery has been screaming to be replaced for months now, but that replacement isn't cheap. Which is why this new nanowire battery out of the University of California, Irvine, is so exciting. Batteries like the one in your phone are lithium-based, and over time, they hold less and less of a charge. That's why your once new 10-hour laptop battery may now only last two hours. Researchers were working on creating batteries with gold-coated nanowires, which are extremely thin and fragile but still highly conductive. But the problem with wires is they eventually break. The study's leader tried coating the nanowires in a thin plexiglass-like gel and started cycling them. A battery goes through one cycle each time it's drained and then fully recharged. It turns out the gel made the wires more flexible and helped them not break, even after hundreds of thousands of charges. Normally, the batteries found in personal electronics — or even in cars — will noticeably lose capacity after 5,000 to 7,000 cycles. This new battery, on the other hand, made it to 200,000 cycles. That's like 30 to 40 times more life without any signs of losing charge."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"Its intention is to provide interested individuals and organisations with practical guidelines for the use and application of open content licences: How do open content licences work? How do I choose the most suitable licence for my individual needs? Where can I find open content online? These are only some of the questions which these guidelines try to answer.

<li><p><a href="http://www.aliprandi.org/cc-user-guide/aliprandi_cc_user_2.pdf">Creative Commons: a user guide</a></p>

<p><em>"Here is an operational manual which guides creators step by step in the world of Creative Commons licenses, the most famous and popular licenses for  free distribution of intellectual products. Without neglecting useful conceptual clarifications, the author goes into technical details of the tools offered by Creative Commons, thus making them also understandable for total neophytes. This is a fundamental book for all those who are interested in the opencontent and copyleft world."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.openbookpublishers.com//download/book_content/150">The Digital Public Domain: Foundations for an Open Culture</a></p>

<p><em>"Digital technology has made culture more accessible than ever before. Texts, audio, pictures and video can easily be produced, disseminated, used and remixed using devices that are increasingly user-friendly and affordable. However, along with this technological democratization comes a paradoxical flipside: the norms regulating culture's use - copyright and related rights - have become increasingly restrictive. This book brings together essays by academics, librarians, entrepreneurs, activists and policy makers, who were all part of the EU-funded Communia project. Together the authors argue that the Public Domain - that is, the informational works owned by all of us, be that literature, music, the output of scientific research, educational material or public sector information - is fundamental to a healthy society. The essays range from more theoretical papers on the history of copyright and the Public Domain, to practical examples and case studies of recent projects that have engaged with the principles of Open Access and Creative Commons licensing. The book is essential reading for anyone interested in the current debate about copyright and the Internet. It opens up discussion and offers practical solutions to the difficult question of the regulation of culture at the digital age."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://web.mit.edu/evhippel/www/books/DI/DemocInn.pdf">Democratizing Innovation</a></p>

<p><em>"Innovation is rapidly becoming democratized. Users, aided by improvements in computer and communications technology, increasingly can develop their own new products and services. These innovating users -- both individuals and firms -- often freely share their innovations with others, creating user-innovation communities and a rich intellectual commons. In Democratizing Innovation, Eric von Hippel looks closely at this emerging system of user-centered innovation. He explains why and when users find it profitable to develop new products and services for themselves, and why it often pays users to reveal their innovations freely for the use of all.The trend toward democratized innovation can be seen in software and information products -- most notably in the free and open-source software movement -- but also in physical products. Von Hippel's many examples of user innovation in action range from surgical equipment to surfboards to software security features. He shows that product and service development is concentrated among "lead users," who are ahead on marketplace trends and whose innovations are often commercially attractive."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://web.mit.edu/evhippel/www-old/books/sources/SofI.pdf">The Sources of Innovation</a></p>

<p><em>"It has long been assumed that new product innovations are typically developed by product manufacturers, an assumption that has inevitably had a major impact on innovation-related research and activities ranging from how firms organize their research and development to how governments measure innovation. In this synthesis of his seminal research, von Hippel challenges that basic assumption and demonstrates that innovation occurs in different places in different industries. Presenting a series of studies showing that end-users, material suppliers, and others are the typical sources of innovation in some fields, von Hippel explores why this variation in the "functional" sources of innovation occurs and how it might be predicted. He also proposes and tests some implications of replacing a manufacturer-as-innovator assumption with a view of the innovation process as predictably distributed across users, manufacturers, and suppliers. Innovation, he argues, will take place where there is greatest economic benefit to the innovator."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"The Internet revolution has come. Some say it has gone. What was responsible for its birth? Who is responsible for its demise? In The Future of Ideas, Lawrence Lessig explains how the Internet revolution has produced a counterrevolution of devastating power and effect. The explosion of innovation we have seen in the environment of the Internet was not conjured from some new, previously unimagined technological magic; instead, it came from an ideal as old as the nation. Creativity flourished there because the Internet protected an innovation commons. The Internet’s very design built a neutral platform upon which the widest range of creators could experiment. The legal architecture surrounding it protected this free space so that culture and information–the ideas of our era–could flow freely and inspire an unprecedented breadth of expression. But this structural design is changing–both legally and technically."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"With the success of open access publishing, Massive open online courses (MOOCs) and open education practices, the open approach to education has moved from the periphery to the mainstream. This marks a moment of victory for the open education movement, but at the same time the real battle for the direction of openness begins. As with the green movement, openness now has a market value and is subject to new tensions, such as venture capitalists funding MOOC companies. This is a crucial time for determining the future direction of open education. In this volume, Martin Weller examines four key areas that have been central to the developments within open education: open access, MOOCs, open education resources and open scholarship. Exploring the tensions within these key arenas, he argues that ownership over the future direction of openness is significant to all those with an interest in education."</em></p></li>

<p>Com a disponibilidade de ferramentas que permitem dar azo a nossa imaginação na criação de peças 3D e espaços como o <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/">thingiverse</a> para as publicar, esta rubrica apresenta alguns modelos selecionados que poderão ser úteis.</p>

<p><img src="MP53_SmdSmallPartsDrawersCustomizab.jpg" alt="MP53_SmdSmallPartsDrawersCustomizab" /></p>

<p>I love keeping my electronic components neatly organized so I can find them when I need them. When I have a jumble of bags of parts I forget what I have and it's a constant waste of time weeding through everything.</p>

<p>I've been meaning to modify the old drawer box for a while now to add more tiny drawer slots to efficiently hold very small components like smd parts, ceramic caps, and tiny screws. I modified the model to support 5x2 slots in a drawer and also made the divider wall between the slots thinner.</p>

<p>I recently received a batch of ceramic caps divided into 50 different values. 10 slots per drawer worked out perfectly for the size of ceramic caps I have.</p>

<p>Currently there is a bug rendering when I try to make the number of rows 3 or greater and I get the following message:
WARNING: Normalized tree is growing past 200000 elements. Aborting normalization.</p>

<p>Enjoy and please share any pics and comments about organizing ideas for your own small parts.</p>

<p><em>"There are three key components to healthy air. It must be fresh, clean, and have the proper humidity. Humans are sensitive to humidity because the human body uses evaporative cooling, enabled by perspiration, as the primary mechanism to rid itself of waste heat. Humans can be comfortable within a wide range of humidity depending on the temperaturefrom thirty to seventy percent but ideally between 50% and 60%. Very low humidity can create discomfort, respiratory problems, and aggravate allergies in some individuals. In the winter, it is advisable to maintain relative humidity at 30 percent or above. Extremely low (below 20%) relative humidity may also cause eye irritation. Humidify your home, especially the bedrooms. Low humidity is a common cause of nosebleeds. The right humidity levels help your home to feel cool in the summer and warm in the winter. In the winter, or in regions that tend to be cold for most of the year, humidification, or adding moisture, is essential. This project sense temperature &amp; humidity from your room or environment and check either it is in comfortable range or not. If it finds that relative humidity is lower than the required limit, it turns on the humidifier for 10 seconds, then again checks the humidity level. If not adequate then again turns on. Seeed studio HSM-20G temperature &amp; humidity sensor is used here to sense the temperature and humidity. A LCD display is used to show the temperature and humidity level on your room. You can use Grove button to manually control the humidifier. To control all the things Arduino UNO is used."</em></p></li>
