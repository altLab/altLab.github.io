<p>Esta semana foi publicado um artigo sobre um trabalho levado a cabo pela equipa de cientistas que em 2013 encontraram vulnerabilidades graves que permitiam ligar os carros do grupo Volkswagen. Na altura a empresa ameaçou a equipa com uma ação em tribunal e conseguiu atrasar a publicação deste trabalho dois anos. A equipa continuou o seu trabalho e descobriu problemas ainda mais graves que permitem com um equipamento de baixo custo abrir as portas dos carros produzidos pelo mesmo grupo. Entre hoje e amanhã vão cruzar os céus do nosso planeta restos de um antigo cometa que ao entrarem em contacto com a nossa atmosfera irão incendiar-se. A Seagate apresentou no simpósio de Memórias Flash um Disco SSD de 60 Terabytes.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. Na rubrica "Documentação" apresentamos duas revistas que podem ser descarregadas livremente e que esta semana são a newelectronics de 9 de Agosto 2016 e a Electronics Maker de agosto de 2016.</p>

<p><img src="NS67_ANewWirelessHackCanUnlock100Mi.jpg" alt="NS67_ANewWirelessHackCanUnlock100Mi" /></p>

<p><em>"In 2013, when University of Birmingham computer scientist Flavio Garcia and a team of researchers were preparing to reveal a vulnerability that allowed them to start the ignition of millions of Volkswagen cars and drive them off without a key, they were hit with a lawsuit that delayed the publication of their research for two years. But that experience doesn’t seem to have deterred Garcia and his colleagues from probing more of VW’s flaws: Now, a year after that hack was finally publicized, Garcia and a new team of researchers are back with another paper that shows how Volkswagen left not only its ignition vulnerable but the keyless entry system that unlocks the vehicle’s doors, too. And this time, they say, the flaw applies to practically every car Volkswagen has sold since 1995. Later this week at the Usenix security conference in Austin, a team of researchers from the University of Birmingham and the German engineering firm Kasper &amp; Oswald plan to reveal two distinct vulnerabilities they say affect the keyless entry systems of an estimated nearly 100 million cars. One of the attacks would allow resourceful thieves to wirelessly unlock practically every vehicle the Volkswagen group has sold for the last two decades, including makes like Audi and Skoda. The second attack affects millions more vehicles, including Alfa Romeo, Citroen, Fiat, Ford, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Opel, and Peugeot."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="NS67_LookUpPerseidMeteorShowerPeaks.jpg" alt="NS67_LookUpPerseidMeteorShowerPeaks" /></p>

<p><em>"Make plans now to stay up late or set the alarm early next week to see a cosmic display of “shooting stars” light up the night sky. Known for it’s fast and bright meteors, the annual Perseid meteor shower is anticipated to be one of the best potential meteor viewing opportunities this year. The Perseids show up every year in August when Earth ventures through trails of debris left behind by an ancient comet. This year, Earth may be in for a closer encounter than usual with the comet trails that result in meteor shower, setting the stage for a spectacular display."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"The bar for solid state drive (SSD) capacity has officially been set, and Seagate is the company that set it. At the 2016 Flash Memory Summit in Santa Clara, CA, Seagate displayed its new 60TB Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) SSD, the world's highest capacity SSD. With capacity like that, one would only need 17 individual drives to reach 1 petabyte of capacity, Seagate noted in a photo it displayed on Twitter. The drive is housed in an HDD 3.5-inch form factor, and is "ideal for large storage arrays, active archives and read-intensive environments," a display said."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT67_MitAndDarpaPackLidarSensorOnto.jpg" alt="CT67_MitAndDarpaPackLidarSensorOnto" /></p>

<p><em>"Light detection and ranging, or lidar, is a sensing technology based on laser light. It’s similar to radar, but can have a higher resolution, since the wavelength of light is about 100,000 times smaller than radio wavelengths. For robots, this is very important: Since radar cannot accurately image small features, a robot equipped with only a radar module would have a hard time grasping a complex object. At the moment, primary applications of lidar are autonomous vehicles and robotics, but also include terrain and ocean mapping and UAVs. Lidar systems are integral to almost all autonomous vehicles and many other robots that operate autonomously in commercial or industrial environments."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT67_SprinklingOfNeuralDustOpensDoo.jpg" alt="CT67_SprinklingOfNeuralDustOpensDoo" /></p>

<p><em>"Because these batteryless sensors could also be used to stimulate nerves and muscles, the technology also opens the door to “electroceuticals” to treat disorders such as epilepsy or to stimulate the immune system or tamp down inflammation. The so-called neural dust, which the team implanted in the muscles and peripheral nerves of rats, is unique in that ultrasound is used both to power and read out the measurements. Ultrasound technology is already well-developed for hospital use, and ultrasound vibrations can penetrate nearly anywhere in the body, unlike radio waves, the researchers say."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT67_TinyHighPerformanceSolarCellsT.jpg" alt="CT67_TinyHighPerformanceSolarCellsT" /></p>

<p><em>"University of Wisconsin—Madison engineers have created high-performance, micro-scale solar cells that outshine comparable devices in key performance measures. The miniature solar panels could power myriad personal devices — wearable medical sensors, smartwatches, even autofocusing contact lenses. Large, rooftop photovoltaic arrays generate electricity from charges moving vertically. The new, small cells, described today (Aug. 3, 2016) in the journal Advanced Materials Technologies, capture current from charges moving side-to-side, or laterally. And they generate significantly more energy than other sideways solar systems."</em></p></li>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1706470">Articulated Robot In 10 Minutes</a></h2>

<p><img src="MP67_ArticulatedRobotIn10Minutes.jpg" alt="MP67_ArticulatedRobotIn10Minutes" /></p>

<p>I have a problem - it's difficult to demonstrate a 3D printer to your guests - you show them the printer, send a small print, and .... it will be ready after they leave.</p>

<p>So I designed this model with the explicit purpose of being able to completely pint it before everyone get's bored and moves on.</p>

<p>This model takes 9 minutes according to Cura's estimate, in reality, on my printer, it takes 12 minutes (not including warmup)</p>

<p>This model is tiny, the features of this model are probably just about the smallest you can print with a 0.4mm nozzle</p>

<p>Print with no supports and no infill</p>

<p>Designed with SketchUp, fixed with Microsoft 3D Builder, sliced with Cura, printed on a Robo 3D R1+</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1705188">Sundial</a></h2>

<p>3D printing a sun-dial is a great way to learn about our solar system, and the history of astronomy (from the ancients like Aristarchus of Samos, through to Copernicus and Galileo). Our sense of time is determined by the spinning of the earth, and it changes depending on where we are in our orbit around the sun. A sundial is a time-telling device that is most closely linked to these cycles. The more the kid understands about the earth and the sun, the better they will be able to place it more accurately (parallel to the Earth's rotational axis), and even adjust their 3D design for their geography (it can be made more precise that way).</p>

<p>A sun-dial also tells another story: the history of time-telling. For thousands of years people have tried to make machines to tell the time - such as sundials, water clocks, candle clocks, hourglass and through to the more modern devices using gears, springs and weights, or today’s electronic and atomic clocks. Kids can learn about the ancient civilizations (the Romans, the Druids of Stonehenge etc.) based on how they told the time, and also learn about the history of technology as they see the progression from the ancient Egyptian sundials of 3,500 years ago to today’s atomic clocks.</p>

<p><em>"If you have ever been to Belgium and visited Brussels one of the attractions there is the Atomium. This was built for the Expo 1958 Brussels World Trade Fair and was designed by Andre Waterkeyn. Originally constructed in Aluminium it has since been renovated in 2005 and is now Stainless Steel. It stands 102M (335ft) high and consists of nine 18M (59ft) diameter spheres connected to denote the shape of a single Iron crystal magnified 165 billion times! It was this design that gave me the inspiration for the Atomium Nixie Clock, albeit a much simplified design. My design consists of the six outer spheres connected to a middle sphere with the clock figures in the outer spheres and a Dekatron spinner in the central one."</em>

<p><em>"While attending a conference for work, I received a Raspberry Pi Zero as a giveaway. Naturally I started trying to figure out what to do with it. Remote control a drone? Webcam collar for my cat? With a computer that small, there were lots of things that could be done. While searching the web to see what others had done with the Zero, I came across Terence Eden's Blog where he described placing his zero inside an Xbox controller. I decided to try and make a "cleaner" version of his project."</em>

I dont know if is the process of beer making, that is typically a step process with support of specific technology, or the typical mindset of the home brew, but as a matter of fact almost all home brewers are very proud of building their own instruments and equipment. In my long home-brewing experience I have found that one of the common passion in the community is the self-building and DIY of the equipment needed for beer production.

And besides, I like making things as small and slimline and dinky as possible. The little PCB above is a backpack for an LCD. Couldnt avoid having to drill holes along the top to connect to the LCD itself, but everything else can be surface mounted. But sometimes you need a way to connect, say, an nRF transceiver, or one of those newfangled ESP8266 WIFI module to your PCB, and they come already fitted with a pin header. And that would mean drilling more holes, and having the module standing off the board slightly. Yuck. So heres my hacky approach. First, design your PCB so the pads are on the top of your board, rather than the bottom: were going to take advantage of the fact the little transceivers are always double-sided boards, with through-hole plated holes."</em>

We have a swimming pool equipped with a control system "automatically" pH and chlorine (electrolysis). Except that the chlorine control is not so "automatic" than that. The unit we have is the JUSTSALT + Pool Technology . Chlorine generation is defined as a percentage of the operating time and not in the measurement of the chlorine present in the water. Only appeared later models (like JUSTSALT PRO) feature a ORP sensor (measuring chlorine levels) and are therefore able to intelligently adjust the chlorine production. Over time we noticed that chlorine varies widely sunshine, attendance and the presence of the cover. So when the pool is closed, I noticed that the setting should be about 5% and 50% to 80% when open. But this also depends on the stabilizer content present in the water. Basically, it is anything but practice and as a result, the chlorine level was rarely good ... "</em>
