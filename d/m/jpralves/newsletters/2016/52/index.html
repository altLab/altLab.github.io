<p><img src="NS52_ThisBatteryFreeComputerSucksPo.jpg" alt="NS52_ThisBatteryFreeComputerSucksPo" /></p>

<p><em>"Today, the biggest hurdle when it comes to designing new gadgets is battery technology. These big, bulky things restrict the forms our smartphones, computers, and wearables can take, and unfortunately, battery technology is so stagnant that there's no promise of things getting better any time soon. But what if you could leave the battery out of the equation entirely? That's just what the University of Washington's Sensor Lab has done. Researchers there created the WISP, or Wireless Identification and Sensing Platform: a combination sensor and computing chip that doesn't need a battery or a wired power source to operate. Instead, it sucks in radio waves emitted from a standard, off-the-shelf RFID reader—the same technology that retail shops use to deter shoplifters—and converts them into electricity."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/new-8-megapixel-camera-board-sale-25/">NEW Raspberri PI 8-MEGAPIXEL CAMERA BOARD ON SALE</a></p>

<p><img src="NS52_NewRaspberriPi8MegapixelCamera.jpg" alt="NS52_NewRaspberriPi8MegapixelCamera" /></p>

<p><em>"The 5-megapixel visible-light camera board was our first official accessory back in 2013, and it remains one of your favourite add-ons. They’ve found their way into a bunch of fun projects, including telescopes, kites, science lessons and of course the Naturebytes camera trap. It was soon joined by the Pi NoIR infrared-sensitive version, which not only let you see in the dark, but also opened the door to hyperspectral imaging hacks. As many of you know, the OmniVision OV5647 sensor used in both boards was end-of-lifed at the end of 2014. Our partners both bought up large stockpiles, but these are now almost completely depleted, so we needed to do something new. Fortunately, we’d already struck up conversation with Sony’s image sensor division, and so in the nick of time we’re able to announce the immediate availability of both visible-light and infrared cameras based on the Sony IMX219 8-megapixel sensor, at the same low price of $25. They’re available today from our partners RS Components and element14, and should make their way to your favourite reseller soon."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="NS52_CypressToAcquireBroadcomsWirel.jpg" alt="NS52_CypressToAcquireBroadcomsWirel" /></p>

<p><em>"Cypress Semiconductor Corp. and Broadcom Limited today announced the signing of a definitive agreement under which Cypress will acquire Broadcom’s Wireless Internet of Things (IoT) business and related assets in an all-cash transaction valued at $550 million. Under the terms of the deal, Cypress will acquire Broadcom’s Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and Zigbee IoT product lines and intellectual property, along with its WICED brand and developer ecosystem. Broadcom’s IoT business unit, which employs approximately 430 people worldwide, generated $189 million in revenue during the last twelve months. The acquisition strengthens Cypress’s position in key embedded systems markets, such as automotive and industrial, and establishes it as a leader in the high-growth consumer IoT market, a segment that includes wearable electronics and home automation solutions."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT52_EvidenceForANewPhaseOfDenseHyd.jpg" alt="CT52_EvidenceForANewPhaseOfDenseHyd" /></p>

<p><em>"Almost 80 years ago it was predicted that, under sufficient compression, the H–H bond in molecular hydrogen (H2) would break, forming a new, atomic, metallic, solid state of hydrogen. Reaching this predicted state experimentally has been one of the principal goals in high-pressure research for the past 30 years. Using in-situ high-pressure Raman spectroscopy, a team headed by Prof. Eugene Gregoryanz studied hydrogen and its heavier isotopes hydrogen deuteride and deuterium at room temperature to pressures above 380 GPa. The experimental data indicate that above 325 GPa H2 and HD adopt a new solid phase, phase V. This phase may be a precursor to the non-molecular (atomic and metallic) state of hydrogen that was predicted 80 years ago."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT52_SelfAdaptiveMaterialHealsItsel.jpg" alt="CT52_SelfAdaptiveMaterialHealsItsel" /></p>

<p><em>"An adaptive material invented at Rice University combines self-healing and reversible self-stiffening properties. The Rice material called SAC (for self-adaptive composite) consists of what amounts to sticky, micron-scale rubber balls that form a solid matrix. The researchers made SAC by mixing two polymers and a solvent that evaporates when heated, leaving a porous mass of gooey spheres. When cracked, the matrix quickly heals, over and over. And like a sponge, it returns to its original form after compression."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT52_HarnessingTheEnergyOfSmallBend.jpg" alt="CT52_HarnessingTheEnergyOfSmallBend" /></p>

<p><em>"For many applications such as biomedical, mechanical, or environmental monitoring devices, harnessing the energy of small motions could provide a small but virtually unlimited power supply. While a number of approaches have been attempted, researchers at MIT have now developed a completely new method based on electrochemical principles, which could be capable of harvesting energy from a broader range of natural motions and activities, including walking. The new system, based on the slight bending of a sandwich of metal and polymer sheets, is described in the journal Nature Communications, in a paper by MIT professor Ju Li, graduate students Sangtae Kim and Soon Ju Choi, and four others."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT52_CanadianPhysicistsDiscoverNewP.jpg" alt="CT52_CanadianPhysicistsDiscoverNewP" /></p>

<p><em>"New findings from an international collaboration led by Canadian scientists may eventually lead to a theory of how superconductivity initiates at the atomic level, a key step in understanding how to harness the potential of materials that could provide lossless energy storage, levitating trains and ultra-fast supercomputers."</em></p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/gg244338.pdf">Introduction to Networking Technologies</a></p>

<p><em>"This book describes a sampling of technologies of various types, by using a tutorial approach. It compares the technologies available in the three major technology areas: application support, transport networks, and subnetworking. In addition, the applicability of these technologies within a particular situation is illustrated using a set of typical customer situations."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://beust.com/algorithms.pdf">Algorithms</a></p>

<p><em>"This text, extensively class-tested over a decade at UC Berkeley and UC San Diego, explains the fundamentals of algorithms in a story line that makes the material enjoyable and easy to digest. Emphasis is placed on understanding the crisp mathematical idea behind each algorithm, in a manner that is intuitive and rigorous without being unduly formal. Features include: The use of boxes to strengthen the narrative: pieces that provide historical context, descriptions of how the algorithms are used in practice, and excursions for the mathematically sophisticated. Carefully chosen advanced topics that can be skipped in a standard one-semester course, but can be covered in an advanced algorithms course or in a more leisurely two-semester sequence."</em></p></li>

Extreme Programming (XP) is a software development methodology that enables users, business people, programmers, and computers to communicate effectively. Perl is a dynamic programming language that lets an XP team embrace the inevitable change caused by effective communication. Perl is the fixer and doer of the pair, and XP is the organizer and facilitator. Together they help you build robust software applications efficiently."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"Lawrence Lessig, “the most important thinker on intellectual property in the Internet era” (The New Yorker), masterfully argues that never before in human history has the power to control creative progress been so concentrated in the hands of the powerful few, the so-called Big Media. Never before have the cultural powers- that-be been able to exert such control over what we can and can’t do with the culture around us. Our society defends free markets and free speech; why then does it permit such top-down control? To lose our long tradition of free culture, Lawrence Lessig shows us, is to lose our freedom to create, our freedom to build, and, ultimately, our freedom to imagine."</em></p></li>

<h1 id="Modelos-3D">Modelos 3D <a href="#topo">^</a></h1>

<p>Com a disponibilidade de ferramentas que permitem dar azo a nossa imaginação na criação de peças 3D e espaços como o <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/">thingiverse</a> para as publicar, esta rubrica apresenta alguns modelos selecionados que poderão ser úteis.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:64008">Arduino OpenSCAD mounting library (v2.0)</a></h2>

<p><img src="MP52_ArduinoOpenscadMountingLibrary.jpg" alt="MP52_ArduinoOpenscadMountingLibrary" /></p>

<p>This is a library of OpenSCAD modules for mounting Arduino boards. It has modules for creating enclosures, bumpers, mounting holes, punch out holes for jacks like USB and power and board dimensions. If you are making a custom enclosure or are mounting an Arduino board to a larger project this should make it easier.
Included is an example scad file and some stls of bumpers generated with the library. The long term goal is to make this useful for a variety of boards not just Arduinos.</p>

<p>This is version 2.0. If your looking for the original look the v1.0 release at my Github repository:
https://github.com/kellyegan/Arduino-Mounting-OpenSCAD-Library</p>

<p>The library uses tbuser's pin library for the pin mounts: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10541</p>

<p>There are a number of great designs for individual Arduino board enclosures that I used for inspiration including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Chu's bumper: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:26237</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1497299">Parametric Sealing Clip</a></h2>

<p><img src="MP52_ParametricSealingClip.jpg" alt="MP52_ParametricSealingClip" /></p>

<p>This is a universal sealing clip suitable for almost all soft materials such as film bags and balloons. Most of the features can be precisely adjusted for a specific task, and the clamping force is distributed evenly to prevent damaging the material.</p>

<p>It is designed not to have many sharp points but you may have to check the final print over and clean it up depending on your printer.</p>

<p>If you are using these for balloons I recommend that you consider leaving the hand grip off if the clip may end up pushed up against them.</p>

<p>Ikea 60mm Clip: 40mm length, 4.5mm Studs, 1.1mm Gap.
Ikea 110mm Clip: 90mm length, 4.5mm Studs, 1.1mm Gap.</p>

<p>In case anyone is interested, the filament I use is made by Aurarum Australia.</p>

<ul>
<li>205°C PLA</li>
<li>60°C Bed</li>
<li>0.2 mil</li>
<li>2-3 Solid Layers</li>
<li>2 Perimeters</li>
<li>25% Infill</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1526178">Customizable Bearing Spacer</a></h2>

<p><img src="MP52_CustomizableBearingSpacer.jpg" alt="MP52_CustomizableBearingSpacer" /></p>

<p>Create spacers for all situations.</p>

<p>Before create, get dimensions of the bearing, screw, and ofc space to fill.
keep in mind your layer resolution when creating.</p>

<p>provided *.stl sample is for 608Z bearing, 3mm spacing, with M4 screw lead.</p>

<p><em>"How would one be able to restart a system that has been deployed in a remote area which gives no immediate access for human intervention? The answer is to give the system an ability to reset itself in case of a system crash. This is where a watchdog timer (WDT) comes into use. It is a hardware based timer capable of automatically resetting a system should the main program fail to periodically send out a heartbeat. Now, the Arduino does indeed have a WDT on board, as do probably all microcontrollers, but a small amount of reading will inform you that once it has started running a sketch, there is no software function that has the same effect as pressing the reset button."</em></p></li>

Stepper motors work here independent what allows twisting right and left. However, the disadvantage of using stepper motor is the low rotational speed which translates into a speed of the robot.
