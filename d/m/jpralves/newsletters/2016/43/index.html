<p><img src="NS43_SamsungIntroducesIndustrysFirs.jpg" alt="NS43_SamsungIntroducesIndustrysFirs" /></p>

<p><em>"Samsung Electronics, the world leader in advanced memory technology, announced that it is now mass producing the industry’s first 256-gigabyte (GB) embedded memory based on the Universal Flash Storage (UFS) 2.0 standard, for next-generation high-end mobile devices. The newly introduced embedded memory features outstanding performance for mobile devices that exceeds that of a typical SATA-based SSD for PCs."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://blog.atmel.com/2016/02/23/attiny102104-are-self-programmable-8-and-14-pin-tinyavr-mcus/">ATtiny102/104 are self-programmable, 8- and 14-pin tinyAVR MCUs</a></p>

<p><img src="NS43_Attiny102104AreSelfProgrammabl.jpg" alt="NS43_Attiny102104AreSelfProgrammabl" /></p>

<p><em>"Making its debut at Embedded World 2016, Atmel has returned to its old-school ways with the world’s highest-performance, low-power, 8-bit microcontrollers boasting 1KB Flash memory. The all-new ATtiny102/104 run up to 12MIPS and integrate features previously only available in larger more expensive MCUs, making them ideal for smaller applications including logic replacement and the latest cost-optimized applications in the consumer, industrial and home automation markets."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://news.rutgers.edu/news/braille-maps-blind-and-visually-impaired-created-3-d-printing-technology-rutgers/20160221">Braille Maps for Blind and Visually Impaired Created with 3-D Printing Technology at Rutgers</a></p>

<p><img src="NS43_BrailleMapsForBlindAndVisually.jpg" alt="NS43_BrailleMapsForBlindAndVisually" /></p>

<p><em>"Using a high-tech 3-D printer, a Rutgers undergraduate and his professor created sophisticated braille maps to help blind and visually impaired people navigate a local training center.
The three plastic tactile maps are for each floor at the Joseph Kohn Training Center, a state-funded facility for the blind and visually impaired in New Brunswick. And the goal is to print maps for all of the center’s students."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT43_HowToMakeElectronsBehaveLikeAL.jpg" alt="CT43_HowToMakeElectronsBehaveLikeAL" /></p>

<p><em>"Electrical resistance is a simple concept: Rather like friction slowing down an object rolling on a surface, resistance slows the flow of electrons through a conductive material. But two physicists have now found that electrons can sometimes cooperate to turn resistance on its head, producing vortices and backward flow of electric current. The prediction of “negative resistance” is just one of a set of counterintuitive and bizarre fluid-like effects encountered under certain exotic circumstances, involving systems of strongly interacting particles in a sheet of graphene, a two-dimensional form of carbon. The findings are described in a paper appearing today in the journal Nature Physics, by MIT professor of physics Leonid Levitov and Gregory Falkovich, a professor at Israel’s Weizmann Institute of Science."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.salford.ac.uk/news/articles/2016/physicists-prove-new-potential-for-silicon-chips">Physicists prove new potential for silicon chips</a></p>

<p><img src="CT43_PhysicistsProveNewPotentialFor.jpg" alt="CT43_PhysicistsProveNewPotentialFor" /></p>

<p><em>"SCIENTISTS have opened a door to faster, cheaper telecommunications after proving a new link between silicon chips and ‘rare-earth’ metals used in internet signalling. Silicon is the ‘gold standard’ semiconductor at the heart of the computer industry but lacks the ability to produce, detect and amplify the light signals that are sent down optical fibre. For the amplification of these light signals, we rely on rare-earth elements, which were thought to not interact optically with silicon. However physicists at the University of Salford and the University of Surrey have made a novel discovery by showing for the first time, that light can be generated by an electron ‘jumping’ directly between silicon and rare-earths."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=35100">Fast Radio Bursts: First Distance Measurement</a></p>

<p><img src="CT43_FastRadioBurstsFirstDistanceMe.jpg" alt="CT43_FastRadioBurstsFirstDistanceMe" /></p>

<p><em>"Have we finally traced a Fast Radio Burst to its place of origin? News from the CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation) radio telescopes in eastern Australia, along with confirming data from the Japanese Subaru instrument in Hawaii, suggests the answer is yes. Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are transient radio pulses that last scant milliseconds. In that amount of time, they have been known to emit as much energy as the Sun emits in 10,000 years. And exactly what causes FRBs is still a mystery. Take the so-called ‘Lorimer Burst’ ( FRB 010724) which was discovered in archival data from 2001 at the Parkes radio telescope in New South Wales. Here we’re dealing with a 30-jansky dispersed burst that was less than 5 milliseconds in duration. Although the burst appeared roughly in the direction of the Small Magellanic Cloud, the FRB is not thought to be associated with our galaxy at all. A 2015 event, FRB 110523, was discovered in data from the Green Bank dish in West Virginia, with an origin thought to be as much as six billion light years away."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://technology.nasa.gov/patent/LAR-TOPS-132">Mechanoresponsive Healing Polymers</a></p>

<p><img src="CT43_MechanoresponsiveHealingPolyme.jpg" alt="CT43_MechanoresponsiveHealingPolyme" /></p>

<p><em>"NASA Langley Research Center is developing an innovative self-healing resin that automatically reacts to mechanical stimuli. Current structural materials are not self-healing, making it necessary to depend on complicated and potentially destructive repair methods and long down times. Unlike other proposed self-healing materials that use microencapsulated healing agents, this technology utilizes viscoelastic properties from inherent structure properties. The resulting technology is a self-healing material with rapid rates of healing and a wide range of use temperatures."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.nist.gov/pml/div684/20150908lightsaber.cfm">NIST Physicists Show ‘Molecules’ Made of Light May Be Possible</a></p>

<p><img src="CT43_NistPhysicistsShowMoleculesMad.jpg" alt="CT43_NistPhysicistsShowMoleculesMad" /></p>

<p><em>"It’s not lightsaber time, not yet. But a team including theoretical physicists from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has taken another step toward building objects out of photons, and the findings* hint that weightless particles of light can be joined into a sort of “molecule” with its own peculiar force. The findings build on previous research that several team members contributed to before joining NIST. In 2013, collaborators from Harvard, Caltech and MIT found a way to bind two photons together so that one would sit right atop the other, superimposed as they travel. Their experimental demonstration was considered a breakthrough, because no one had ever constructed anything by combining individual photons—inspiring some to imagine that real-life lightsabers were just around the corner."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.osa.org/en-us/about_osa/newsroom/news_releases/2015/curly_nanowires_catch_more_light_to_power_nanoscal/">Curly Nanowires Catch More Light to Power Nanoscale Electronic Circuits</a></p>

<p><img src="CT43_CurlyNanowiresCatchMoreLightTo.jpg" alt="CT43_CurlyNanowiresCatchMoreLightTo" /></p>

<p><em>"Researchers from Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey, have shown that twisting straight nanowires into springs can increase the amount of light the wires absorb by up to 23 percent. Absorbing more light is important because one application of nanowires is turning light into electricity, for example to power tiny devices."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"In a world where web services can make real-time data accessible to anyone, how can the government leverage this openness to improve its operations and increase citizen participation and awareness? Through a collection of essays and case studies, leading visionaries and practitioners both inside and outside of government share their ideas on how to achieve and direct this emerging world of online collaboration, transparency, and participation."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://inventwithpython.com/makinggames.pdf">Making Games with Python &amp; Pygame</a></p>

<p><em>" This book will teach you how to make graphical computer games with the Pygame framework (also called the Pygame library) in the Python programming language. Pygame makes it easy to create programs with 2D graphics. Both Python and the Pygame framework can be downloaded for free from http://python.org and http://pygame.org. All you need is a computer and this book to begin making your own games."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://perlhacks.com/dmp.pdf">Data Munging with Perl</a></p>

<li><p><a href="http://devernay.free.fr/cours/IHM/GTK/GGAD.pdf">GTK+ / Gnome Application Development</a></p>

<p><em>"GTK+/Gnome Application Development is an intermediate-to-advanced GTK+/Gnome programming book. You should be comfortable with programming (data structures, algorithms, etc.) and with the C programming language before you try to read it. It's also helpful to have had some introductory exposure to GTK+, via the online tutorial or Eric Harlow's book Developing Linux Applications with GTK+ and GDK (buy from Amazon). However, if you know C and are willing to jump right in you could start with my book, perhaps in conjunction with the GTK+ reference documentation."</em></p></li>

<h1 id="Modelos-3D">Modelos 3D <a href="#topo">^</a></h1>

<p>Com a disponibilidade de ferramentas que permitem dar azo a nossa imaginação na criação de peças 3D e espaços como o <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/">thingiverse</a> para as publicar, esta rubrica apresenta alguns modelos selecionados que poderão ser úteis.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:47270">Raspberry Pi Case</a></h2>

<p><img src="MP43_RaspberryPiCase.jpg" alt="MP43_RaspberryPiCase" /></p>

<p>A base Raspberry Pi case created in OpenSCAD. Wanted a simple base that could be used to build up more complex cases.
The hole for the power cable is a little small so a standard phone charger isn't very tight.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:951069">Raspberry Pi 2 Case (OpenSCAD)</a></h2>

<p><img src="MP43_RaspberryPi2CaseOpenscad.jpg" alt="MP43_RaspberryPi2CaseOpenscad" /></p>

<p>Inspired from other cases I created a fully customizable case with OpenSCAD. You can also add a logo as dxf, please check the source. Therefore I uploaded the Source twice where the difference is only:
logo_use_it=true;
use_ventilation=false;</p>

<p>It is also possible to lock the case with a little screw on the left side. Simply drill hole between the case and the front cover. Please remove your Raspberry Pi 2 first ;-)</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1355018">The Ultimate Parametric Box</a></h2>

<p><img src="MP43_TheUltimateParametricBox.jpg" alt="MP43_TheUltimateParametricBox" /></p>

<p>As any electronic hobbyist, I always need some enclosures to protect my circuits, and of course make them more user friendly.
More over, with the news mini/micro/nano boards, like Arduino, Raspberry/Banana/Orange pies and so on, enclosures are more needed than never before.</p>

<p>Since a moment I'm thinking about taking a look at OpenScad, just to see what can we do with, and learn how it works.
Plus
I love the Thingiverse Customizer, very usefull for those who don't know how to modelise in 3D, or basically, want to have something fast and easy.</p>

<p>So, I started this project....</p>

<p>It was a good starting way to learn, for me.</p>

<p><img src="PM43_RaspberryPiZeroLedstripControl.jpg" alt="PM43_RaspberryPiZeroLedstripControl" /></p>

<p><em>"The Raspberry Pi Zero has been out for quite a while now and inspiring projects with the Pi Zero pop up everywhere on maker websites. The 5 dollar Pi inspired me (Marcel Brouwers) and Chris Kuipers to start a project to control RGB ledstrips using our mobile phone. Sure, there are commercial off the shelf products with fancy Apps that let you control ledstrips, but that doesnt give you the satisfaction achieved by making this yourself. The solution we put together consists of a Raspberry Pi Zero and a custom PCB that takes care of the 12 volt to 5 volt power conversion for the Pi Zero and transistors for controlling the ledstrip (For more info on the hardware, see the hardware section of this post). For controlling the ledstrip via the browser we combined the pi-blaster software, a lighttpd install with php, the bootstrap framework and some php scripts. (For more info on the software, see the software section of this post)"</em></p></li>

The only problems were that the parts were fairly expensive ($50 for the WeMo and $20 for the Arduino + sensors) and the sensors (magnetic reed relay or hall effect) were difficult to install reliably in the garage.

It allows us to use maximum 15 meters cable. Good wiring, low baud rates and less noisy mediums may allow us to exceed this limit a little more. The main problem here , when the distance increases, the noise at the common ground line also increases. Another issue, RS232 allows only two devices to communicate reciprocally. More than two devices can not communicate at this line and we need another solution for this situation. RS485 is the standard that solves this problems. The main difference is, RS485 transfers the data depending on the potential difference between the two communication wires. The polarity defines the logic state of the signal. You can transfer data up to 1220 meters far away and with a rate up to 10 Mbs. 32 devices can join the RS485 network."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"Sometimes we get caught in situations when we need direct solutions without figuring things out in more efficient manner. For instance microcontrollers and pin count. When we need more pins, we start looking for bigger MCU even if processing power is enough even if one additional pin would change the situation. So sometimes this is not effective to waste money and even design to get one or two additional I/Os. Some people may use I/O port expanders or shift registers to get more pins. But as Ralph shows we dont always need head for obvious. There are tons of discrete electronics components around that may save the day. This time he suggests interfacing well known nrf24l01 RF module to small MCU like Attiny85 by using 3 pins instead of 5."</em></p></li>

But if you will want to have an USART option, you will need to user software USART library or write your own routines. You can find many great software USART libraries for that purpose. As a rule you will have to use two pins to establish communication. But if you are tight on I/Os then you can cheat a little and make it work from single pin. Ralph has been experimenting with simple but smart circuit which allows to perform half duplex UART communications with other systems."</em></p></li>

This is all about learning one wire protocol and I did learnt a lot. I think the most important thing is timing, with a uC working at 16Mhz or 8Mhz, you need to carefully counting how many cycles your interrupt routine takes and providing the logical level in time.
