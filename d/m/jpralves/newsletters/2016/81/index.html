<p>Faz hoje anos que nasceu <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Ferdinand_M%C3%B6bius">August Möbius</a>. Este matemático alemão, nascido em 1790, ficou conhecido pela sua descoberta da <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_strip">banda Möbius</a>. Trata-se de uma superfície bidimensional não orientável, com apenas um lado quando embebida no espaço euclidiano tridimensional.
Esta semana ficámos a saber que a Cray apresentou o seu super-computador mais rápido - o XC50 - que ultrapassa o petaflop de pico de processamento por bastidor. A arquitectura deste novo super-computador suporta quatro nós de computação cada um deles juntando o processador central com uma unidade de aceleração gráfica NVIDIA Tesla P100. Os astronautas que se encontravam a bordo da estação espacial chinesa Tiangong-2 vão regressar à Terra no foguetão Shenzhou-11. Dados da sonda New Horizon apontam para a existência de um oceano por baixo da zona gelada em formato de coração em Plutão. Por fim, a Microsemi anunciou o primeiro processador FPGA a disponibilizar uma arquitetura RISC-V assim como uma plataforma de software para o desenvolvimento para este processador.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como alguns modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis.</p>

<p><em>"Europes fastest supercomputer shoulders the challenges of the regions toughest compute problems, from weather modeling to cosmology, and across a very broad range of other scientific domains. As the computational demands for this popular resource increase due to finer resolution on climatology models, more complex scientific computations, bigger datasets, and larger simulations, and as workloads diversify, the system needs to increase in capability and evolve while maintaining a fully utilized production environment. Based on challenging requirements like these, Cray developed the XCTM series supercomputers to easily support differing processor technologies in the same architecture. By leveraging the advantages of continuously changing multicore and many-core processing devices, Cray system owners can target the most appropriate technologies to get the best possible performance out of differing applications."</em> <a href="http://www.cray.com/blog/cray-xc50-nvidia-tesla-p100-gpu-next-giant-leap-compute-performance/">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="https://www.ims.ac.jp/en/news/2016/11/16_3576.html">Worlds fastest quantum simulator operating at the atomic level</a></h2>

<p><em>"Kenji Ohmori (Institute for Molecular Science, National Institutes of Natural Sciences, Japan) has collaborated with Matthias Weidemller (University of Heidelberg), Guido Pupillo (University of Strasbourg), Claudiu Genes (University of Innsbruck) and their coworkers to develop the worlds fastest simulator that can simulate quantum mechanical1) dynamics of a large number of particles interacting with each other within one billionths of a second. The dynamics of many electrons interacting with each other governs a variety of important physical and chemical phenomena such as superconductivity, magnetism, and chemical reactions. An ensemble of many particles thus interacting with each other is referred to as a strongly correlated system2). Understanding the properties of strongly correlated systems is thus one of the central goals of modern sciences. It is extremely difficult, however, to predict theoretically the properties of a strongly correlated system even if one uses the post-K supercomputer3), which is one of the worlds fastest supercomputers planned to be completed by the year 2020 in a national project of Japan. For example, the post-K cannot exactly calculate even the energy, which is the most basic property of matter, when the number of particles in the system is more than 30. Instead of calculating with a classical computer such as the post-K, an alternative concept has been proposed and referred to as a quantum simulator4), in which quantum mechanical particles such as atoms are assembled into an artificial strongly correlated system, whose properties are known and controllable. It is then used to simulate and understand the properties of another strongly correlated system, whose properties are not known. A quantum simulator could simulate quantum mechanical behavior of many particles that cannot be handled even by the post-K, expected to become a next-generation simulation platform to replace supercomputers. Huge investment to the development of quantum simulators has therefore been started recently in national projects of various countries including US, EU, and China."</em> <a href="https://www.ims.ac.jp/en/news/2016/11/16_3576.html">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"In the 1970s, a group of mathematicians started developing a theory according to which codes could be presented at a level one step higher than the sequences formed by zeros and ones: mathematical subspaces named q-analogs. For a long time, no applications were found  or were not even searched for  for the theory until ten years ago, when it was understood that they would be useful in the efficient data transmission required by modern data networks. The challenge was that, despite numerous attempts, the best possible codes described in the theory had not been found and it was therefore believed they did not even exist. However, an international research group disagreed."</em> <a href="http://www.aalto.fi/en/current/news/2016-11-14-002/">[...]</a></p>

I had a look around online at what others had done but they all seemed to be a bit over complicated for a simple home application. Sure, for perfectly accurate measurements you need to monitor both the supply voltage and current but for simple household monitoring which gives estimates cost to the closest few cents, why not keep things simple. So this meter measures the supply current to your home through a CT (current transformer) and then does a couple of calculations to give you your current, power, maximum power and kilowatt hours consumed.

<p><em>"This project describes the making of a simple weighing scale using the Cypress PSoC Analog Coprocessor and a weight/load sensor (also known as a load cell or strain gauge). A Load cell is a transducer which converts the applied force into change in resistance. The fundamental principle behind the working is the Poisson effect. The application of force on a material in one direction, leads to a deformation in the perpendicular direction. Resistances of the load cell are arranged in the form of a Wheatstone bridge. The goal is to measure this change in resistance and translate it back into the units of force (or weight). For this project, the load cell used is a TE FX1901-0001-0025L with the full scale input force of 25 lbf (11.34 kg) and the output voltage span of 20mV/V. This means that if we power the load cell with a voltage (a.k.a "excitation voltage") of 5.0V (typical PSoC VDD), the output span would be 100mV. The TE load cell encompasses a circuit similar to the Wheatstone bridge with one of the arms being the strain gauge which is sensitive to force. The load cell exposes two terminals at which the excitation voltage is to be provided, and two other terminals for the output. The differential voltage across the output is sensed using an analog front end (AFE) implemented in the PSoC Analog Coprocessor. The sensed values are translated into the corresponding mass and made accessible through an I2C interface. The project is implemented on a PSoC Analog Coprocessor kit (CY8CKIT-048) which can be connected to the PC and the output can be visualized on Bridge Control Panel software (the related configuration files LoadCell_BCP.iic and LoadCell_BCP.ini are attached). The red LED on the kit is also made to glow proportional to the sensed load."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/29434/measuring-weight-using-a-load-cell-psoc-561f77">[...]</a>

<p><em>"It's the Leslie Birchinator. Acacia missed it, it may prove poplar, knock on wood... Ok, the switch case is most likely birch. If you have ever listened to the sound of a Hammond organ playing, sometimes there is a distinctive warbly character to the sound that makes it even more special. That is when it is played through a set of Leslie rotating speakers. Leslie speakers have rotating speaker horns(fun fact: one is just for show to balance out the mechanism) and a rotating lower baffle for bass that sends the sound out in different directions as it spins. The effect it creates is a complex blend of varying the sounds loudness(amplitude modulation) and change in pitch(frequency modulation - doppler effect like in hearing a moving siren or train horn). Applying the use of the Leslie speakers or "rotary speaker" effect is part of the skill needed to play the Hammond organ. Mastering the technique to play the Hammond organ is other hard part. And that is even without bass pedals. Time to tame the beast a little. Sorry, the sound is bad since I didn't have external speakers or a direct feed set up and what you hear is from the headphones in the open. And I have to tone down the brightness of the Neopixels. Videoing a moving unicorn is tough to do. There is a animated rainbow lit ring in the slow mode and switching color sweep in the fast mode."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Leslie-Birchinator-Neopixel-Arduino-MIDI-Switch/">[...]</a>
