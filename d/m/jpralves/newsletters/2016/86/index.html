<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia em 1799 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Callan">Nicholas Callan</a>. Este irlandês é responsável pela invenção da bobine de indução. Foi uma daquelas circunstâncias em que a necessidade faz o engenho. Callan precisava de gerar um nível de electricidade mais elevado do que o existente e em 1834 começou a trabalhar nesta ideia que concluiria em 1836 dando origem à primeira bobine de indução. Também faz anos que nasceu <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan">Srinivasa Ramanujan</a>. Este matemático indiano nasceu em 1887 e apesar não ter muita prática com a matemática pura deu contributos bastante significativos nas áreas da analise matemática, teoria de números, séries infinitas e fracções sucessivas. A ele são atribuídas a conjectura de Ramanujan, o primo de Ramanujan, entre outros. Ficou conhecido pelo que disse a GH Hardy quando este fez uma afirmação de que o numero 1729 era chato. E Ramanujan contrapôs indicando que era exactamente o contrário e esse numero possuía propriedades extraordinárias como ser o menor numero expressável pela soma de dois cubos com números inteiros diferentes ( 1729 = 1^3 + 12^3 = 9^3 + 10^3 ). Devido a este episódio e em homenagem a este matemático, cuja carreira foi curta mas brilhante, uma série de desenhos animados - <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-24459279">Futurama apresenta o numero 1729</a> dissimulado em diversos locais.</p>

<p>Nesta semana ficámos a saber que a DPDgroup subsidiaria da La Poste, após dois anos de testes conseguiu obter uma licença para entregar, com o recurso a drones, encomendas num raio de 15 KMs, em França.
A Raspberry Pi Foundation disponibilizou a sua conhecida distribuição Raspbian/PIXEL para o ambiente x86. Isto irá permitir que quem não tenha um Raspberry PI mas ainda assim queira testar como é o seu interface o possa fazer num qualquer PC.
Mark Zuckerberg, o criador do Facebook, apresentou esta semana o projecto pessoal que abraçou durante este ano, que baptizou de "Jarvis". Este projeto, que visa usar inteligência artificial para controlo de uma habitação, permitiu avaliar o estado atual da inteligência artificial para uma utilização deste tipo.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como alguns modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis. Saiu a MagPI Nº 53 de Janeiro de 2017.</p>

<p>Estando na época natalícia resta-me desejar a todos em meu nome e em nome do altLab votos de um excelente Natal com muitas prendas no sapatinho.</p>

<p><em>"Following two years of tests, crowned with success, DPDgroup, GeoPost's international parcel delivery network and international express subsidiary of Le Groupe La Poste, received authorisation from the General Directorate for Civil Aviation to deliver parcels using drones on a regular 15km route. For the first time worldwide, a regular commercial route makes it possible to deliver parcels by drone. Once a week, the DPDgroup drone travels between  Saint-Maximin-La-Sainte-Beaume and Pourrières, in south of France (Provence region). The route makes it possible to delivery items to a cut-off incubator of companies including a dozen start-ups specialized in technology. Their parcels now delivered by Chronopost and DPD France will be sent by drone from the Pick-up point in Saint-Maximin. This represent a new way of addressing the issue of last-mile deliveries, especially when it comes to areas that are difficult to access. For both the departure and arrival of the drone, a delivery terminal is used to secure the parcel loading phases, from take-off to landing and placement of the parcel."</em> <a href="https://www.dpd.com/home/news/latest_news/dpdgroup_drone_delivers_parcels_using_regular_commercial_line">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/pixel-pc-mac/">PIXEL for PC and MAC</a></h2>

<p><em>"Our vision in establishing the Raspberry Pi Foundation was that everyone should be able to afford their own programmable general-purpose computer. The intention has always been that the Raspberry Pi should be a full-featured desktop computer at a $35 price point. In support of this, and in parallel with our hardware development efforts, we’ve made substantial investments in our software stack. These culminated in the launch of PIXEL in September 2016. PIXEL represents our best guess as to what the majority of users are looking for in a desktop environment: a clean, modern user interface; a curated suite of productivity software and programming tools, both free and proprietary; and the Chromium web browser with useful plugins, including Adobe Flash, preinstalled. And all of this is built on top of Debian, providing instant access to thousands of free applications. Put simply, it’s the GNU/Linux we would want to use. Back in the summer, we asked ourselves one simple question: if we like PIXEL so much, why ask people to buy Raspberry Pi hardware in order to run it? There is a massive installed base of PC and Mac hardware out there, which can run x86 Debian just fine. Could we do something for the owners of those machines?"</em> <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/pixel-pc-mac/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"My personal challenge for 2016 was to build a simple AI to run my home -- like Jarvis in Iron Man. My goal was to learn about the state of artificial intelligence -- where we're further along than people realize and where we're still a long ways off. These challenges always lead me to learn more than I expected, and this one also gave me a better sense of all the internal technology Facebook engineers get to use, as well as a thorough overview of home automation. So far this year, I've built a simple AI that I can talk to on my phone and computer, that can control my home, including lights, temperature, appliances, music and security, that learns my tastes and patterns, that can learn new words and concepts, and that can even entertain Max. It uses several artificial intelligence techniques, including natural language processing, speech recognition, face recognition, and reinforcement learning, written in Python, PHP and Objective C. In this note, I'll explain what I built and what I learned along the way."</em> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/building-jarvis/10103347273888091/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Researchers from the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) have made the world's smallest radio receiver, built out of an assembly of atomic-scale defects in pink diamonds. This tiny radio, whose building blocks are the size of two atoms, can withstand extremely harsh environments and is biocompatible, meaning it could work in places as varied as a probe on Venus to a pacemaker in a human heart. The research was led by Marko Loncar, the Tiantsai Lin Professor of Electrical Engineering at SEAS, and graduate student Linbo Shao, and was published in the journal Physical Review Applied. The radio uses tiny imperfections in diamonds called nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers. To make NV centers, researchers replace one carbon atom in a tiny diamond crystal with a nitrogen atom and remove a neighboring atom creating a system that is essentially a nitrogen atom with a hole next to it. NV centers can be used to emit single photons or detect very weak magnetic fields. They have photoluminescent properties, meaning they can convert information into light, making them powerful and promising systems for quantum computing, phontonics, and sensing."</em> <a href="http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/12/the-worlds-tiniest-radio/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"One of the more exciting things happening in physics at the moment is the development of quantum computers that may actually be able to do something useful. But, as we get closer to that glorious day, one of the big questions remaining is: what type of basic technology should be used as the basis for quantum computers? We know from our experience with classical computers that whatever technology wins is going to dominate for a long time. For instance, even though silicon-based integrated circuits were known to be worse than their germanium-based equivalent, silicon won for engineering reasons. Ever since, other semiconductor materials have remained niche, despite continued development. And they'll likely stay niche until silicon is tapped out. The decision on silicon is ancient history, and the consequences are set. But with quantum computers, we haven't reached such a decision point yet. As such, a bazillion ideas are competing, and we get to sit on the sidelines and cheer the players on."</em> <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/12/grids-of-defects-make-diamonds-practical-for-quantum-computing/">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/an-effective-and-low-cost-solution-for-storing-sol/">An effective and low-cost solution for storing solar energy</a></h2>

<p><em>"How can we store solar energy for period when the sun doesn't shine? One solution is to convert it into hydrogen through water electrolysis. The idea is to use the electrical current produced by a solar panel to 'split' water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. Clean hydrogen can then be stored away for future use to produce electricity on demand, or even as a fuel. But this is where things get complicated. Even though different hydrogen-production technologies have given us promising results in the lab, they are still too unstable or expensive and need to be further developed to use on a commercial and large scale. The approach taken by EPFL and CSEM researchers is to combine components that have already proven effective in industry in order to develop a robust and effective system. Their prototype is made up of three interconnected, new-generation, crystalline silicon solar cells attached to an electrolysis system that does not rely on rare metals. The device is able to convert solar energy into hydrogen at a rate of 14.2%, and has already been run for more than 100 hours straight under test conditions. The method, which surpasses previous efforts in terms of stability, performance, lifespan and cost efficiency, is published in the Journal of The Electrochemical Society."</em> <a href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/an-effective-and-low-cost-solution-for-storing-sol/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"As driverless cars merge into our transportation system in the coming years, some researchers believe autonomous vehicles may save fuel by trailing each other in large platoons. Like birds and fighter jets flying in formation, or bikers and race car drivers drafting in packs, vehicles experience less aerodynamic drag when they drive close together. But assembling a vehicle platoon to deliver packages between distribution centers, or to transport passengers between stations, requires time. The first vehicle to arrive at a station must wait for others to show up before they can all leave as a platoon, creating inevitable delays. Now MIT engineers have studied a simple vehicle-platooning scenario and determined the best ways to deploy vehicles in order to save fuel and minimize delays. Their analysis, presented this week at the International Workshop on the Algorithmic Foundations of Robotics, shows that relatively simple, straightforward schedules may be the optimal approach for saving fuel and minimizing delays for autonomous vehicle fleets. The findings may also apply to conventional long-distance trucking and even ride-sharing services."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2016/driverless-truck-platoons-save-time-fuel-1221">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"A plug'n play box. Build your using a few elements like corners, edges, plugs etc. Easily extend or redesign it whenever you want. Use it for drawers or as a shelf or a mix of both. Use the Customizer App for generating the necessary stl files (default is "Set" to generate one set of elements for one layer). Or customize yourself with the attached OpenSCAD-File if you prefer it this way (I do). The drawers are printed in one piece so that the walls can be very thin - plugging them would result in "ugly" big walls. I use a borosilicate glass, so the bottom of the prints is very smooth. The horizontal plugs are printed upside-down. So in the end the drawers will slide without significant friction on the ledges of the horizontal plugs. All parts can be printed without supports."</em> <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1918087">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Since 1988, our town of Holland, Michigan, best known for its annual tulip festival, diverted waste heat from its power plant into pipes that run under streets and sidewalks in the central business district. For years we have enjoyed open, snow-free, access to our downtown, especially in hard, freezing winters with their lake-effect snow storms. We are currently building a new power plant, and have not only connected our snowmelt system to it, but have expanded the system even further, now covering near five miles of sidewalks and roadway. But how well is it working? We can see our sidewalks, but do not have quantitative surface data to show how well the snowmelt performs throughout the city. Are we supplying enough heat to melt the snow? Are we wasting energy by putting too much heat into the system? How should we run the system pumps? We need a device that can monitor performance in various locations over time, and help us make informed decisions as to how to run our snowmelt system. We need a Snowmelt monitor. This device can be placed on the sidewalk anywhere in the system to measure: Ground Temperature; Surface wetness. The device looks much as a traffic counter does - a small box chained to a nearby structure such as a lamp post or a tree. Data collected from the monitor is sent via AT&amp;T to PubNub, where the data can be displayed, analyzed and sent into Snowmelt monitoring systems. With this data informed decisions can be made."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/kayakpete/snowmelt-system-monitor-be4a01">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Finding a free parking lot in a congested city like Dhaka is very hard. Here, if anyone wants to go outside from home with personal car first thing comes in his mind is about parking, where he will park his car. Most of the cases, people go to a parking station and find that all parking slot are full and then he have to search for another parking lot. So, it is a big hassle and many people keep in fear about parking of his car when he gets out with his car. I realized that, to enjoy a better transport a better parking system is necessary especially in a congested city like Dhaka. So, I was thinking, how the problem can be solved and finally I succeeded to make a cloud based smart parking system and I hope implementing the system can remove the parking problem of my city. ARTIK Cloud is really a nice and appropriate platform for such job. Using this system a user will be will able to find an available parking lot easily using mobile or web app from anywhere. I also used Intel Edison with a display which may be placed several important locations of the city or road from where it will be possible to find free parking lot. The system updates parking data every 30 seconds. In this project I will show you how you can easily build such smart system. I will use ARTIK Cloud platform, a cool IoT cloud platform.

<p><em>"In this instructable, I have made a SMPS circuit which can be used to charge your laptop in a car or from any 12V battery. You can plug your existing charger in the circuit. It is not an inverter. Basically it's a DC DC converter, which takes 12V DC as an input and generated 220V DC as an output. The output power is 200W . Now you might be thinking that output is 220V DC and not an AC, while in our home, the grid supply is an AC voltage so how will laptop charger operate on 220V DC? Well, i must say that in any SMPS based charger, the first stage is rectification stage, after that it is processed to low voltage, so it doesn't matter whether you provide either AC voltage or DC voltage it will be rectified to DC only. Remember, this is a DC DC converter so, don't try to connect any inductive load on it."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/SMPS-Charge-Your-Laptop-in-a-Car/">[...]</a></p>

The analog meter can be used to display any sort of metric you like it to do.Voltage, Current, Resistance, Speed, Distance , Magnetic field density....anything that you would want an analog meter to display. However you have to also use your intuition to trick the meter into displaying the value you want it to display. This can be done because Arduino Uno can output voltages between 0-5V in analog output pins. This if properly used in a voltmeter with a range of 0-5V, can be used as a very reliable meter that responds to sudden changes and can also give you very smooth transitions between values, depending upon how you program it."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Wattmeter-Using-Arduino-Uno/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"The Apple ][ personal computer was one of the first three completely assembled systems on the market. It was sold several million times from April 1977 till 1993. This 8 bit home computer was developed by Steve »The Woz« Wozniak and evolved together with Steve Jobs. They paved the way for the Apple Macintosh computer and the nowadays well known brand Apple with its products. Back in 2014 I wrote my Bachelor thesis about emulating a complete Apple ][ (»two«) on an Atmel AVR microcontroller. The thesis describes the implementation of a software emulator for the complete Apple ][ computer system on a single Atmel AVR microcontroller unit (MCU). Although the microcontroller runs at 20 MHz and the Apple ][ runs at roughly 1 MHz it is quite a challenge to get this working. The microcontroller not only emulates the original processor of the Apple ][ computer - the famous MOS 6502 - but also performs other tasks like display output and keyboard input. This requires an efficient emulation of the 6502 and memory management since the resources of a microcontroller are very limited when intending such challenging operations. The thesis shows the development of the processor emulation software and examines different design patterns of reaching the goal of a fast processor emulation. For every different approach the strenghts and weaknesses are scientifically evaluated. The final product is a highly improved emulation of the MOS 6502 CPU, written in AVR assembler, which is then used on an AVR ATMega 1284p microcontroller together with other electronic parts to create a portable and battery powered Apple ][ (emu­lator) handheld prototype."</em> <a href="http://maxstrauch.github.io/projects/bsc-thesis/index.html">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"This instructable describes how to "make" a simple audio headphone amplifier. It can be used with different devices - MP3 players, Walkmans, Radios, .etc. It can be used also for your own designs - can be connected to the analog outputs of audio DACs, to the outputs of self made radios (for example using TDA7000, or TA7642) or other gadgets. In comparison with the other instructables, this will not give you an exact instructions how to do the job, but will give you the idea and show you for example how it can be realized in a particular case. The success of this project will relay on your imagination and capabilities ... The main idea here is - why to make something from scratch, if it exists... Where an existing audio amplifier can be taken from? The answer is - from a defect computer CD-R,W, DVD-R,W reader, writer, ROM-drive.. All they have audio output for headphones, which has almost always a volume control. When those devices broke, normally the malfunction is always in the mechanics, in the laser system, in the optics, but, I think never in the audio headphone amplifier."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Headphone-amplifier/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"This is an IKEA SPÖKA light. It is a small night light resembling a little ghost. Originally powered by an internal rechargable battery, the light is controlled by a single button. When pressing that button it starts cycling through various color combintations. When you press that button again it freezes the current color. That's all it can do. Depending on the model the colors can be a combination of either blue and green or red, orange and blue. Inspired by another SPÖKA mod I decided to also modify such a light, but instead of wirelessly communicating with the device, I wanted to be able to control it through USB. As the power requirements of the SPÖKA light are very low, it can easily be powered through the USB as well. I chose the blue/green model of the SPÖKA light. First I disassembled the light, which by the way is not that easily done, because the silicone skin is attached very tightly."</em> <a href="https://wej.k.vu/hacks/usb_controlled_spoka_night_light/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Radio-frequency identification (RFID) uses electromagnetic fields to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects. The tags contain electronically stored information. Passive tags collect energy from a nearby RFID reader's interrogating radio waves. Active tags have a local power source such as a battery and may operate at hundreds of meters from the RFID reader. Unlike a barcode, the tag need not be within the line of sight of the reader, so it may be embedded in the tracked object. RFID is one method for Automatic Identification and Data Capture (AIDC). RFID tags are used in many industries, for example, an RFID tag attached to an automobile during production can be used to track its progress through the assembly line; RFID-tagged pharmaceuticals can be tracked through warehouses; and implanting RFID microchips in livestock and pets allows positive identification of animals. Since RFID tags can be attached to cash, clothing, and possessions, or implanted in animals and people, the possibility of reading personally-linked information without consent has raised serious privacy concerns. These concerns resulted in standard specifications development addressing privacy and security issues. ISO/IEC 18000 and ISO/IEC 29167 use on-chip cryptography methods for un-traceability, tag and reader authentication, and over-the-air privacy. ISO/IEC 20248 specifies a digital signature data structure for RFID and barcodes providing data, source and read method authenticity. This work is done within ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 31 Automatic identification and data capture techniques."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/RFID-CARD-READER-WITH-ARDUINORFID-RC522-and-LCD-16/">[...]</a></p>

However, the way I did it is perhaps different enough to be worth sharing, or maybe someone knows a better way to do this now and will school me. MIDI is a protocol that musical instrument controllers like keyboards, keytars, electronic wind instruments, or any old thing can use to talk to devices that produce sound - such as other keyboards with built-in sounds, synthesizers, computers, etc. Like rubes, we used to use these clunky 5-pin DIN cables to carry MIDI, but now the slick way to do it is MIDI over USB. Many newer controllers only have USB, which they use for both power and MIDI. This is a problem if you want to talk to something that only has a 5-pin jack for MIDI IN. This is true for most keyboard synths (why build a USB host into it?) and for may DIY synths one might build (legacy MIDI is a lot easier to DIY).

One point to consider when making a clock, Arduino / Atmega328 isn't very accurate over larger periods of time (some people have seen more than 5 minutes of error in 24 hours) so for this project we'll use an RTC (Real Time Clock) Module to keep the time. These also have an added bonus that they have their own back up battery so the time won't be lost in case of power failure. I opted for the DS3231 module as its acurate to 1 minute per year but you could also use a DS1307 but its not as accurate. Obviously you don't need to use all these features, you could just make the basic binary clock and save maybe £10 - to £12 in the process. I went for a 12 hour clock format to keep the size down and to reduced LED counts and it's easier to read too.
