<p>Esta semana foi anunciado pela aliança Wi-fi a norma AC que vem incluir novas funcionalidades como maior desempenho, capacidade e eficiência na gestão da largura de banda das comunicações sem-fio. A equipa de pesquisa da IBM descobriu um processo de reciclagem inovador que permite converter smarphones antigos e CDs em plásticos não-tóxicos de grande rigidez. Cerca de 2.7 milhões de toneladas de plástico são anualmente produzidas e os que são feitos de poli-carbonatos ao fim de algum tempo libertam BPA, um químico que tem efeitos nocivos para o meio ambiente. Foi publicado o novo standard da linguagem EMCAScript também conhecida por Javascript. A Espressif anunciou o ESP8285. Trata-se da evolução do conhecido ESP8266 e que entre outras novidades vem com o processador de 32-bits L106 Diamond com 1 MByte de memória flash.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. Na rubrica "Documentação" apresentamos cinco livros (eBooks) que podem ser descarregados livremente e que esta semana são sobre Scratch - aprender a programar, Preparar e planear uma infraestrutura híbrida de Sharepoint, as dez ferramentas essenciais para o Windows 10, robótica móvel e métricas de "Computer Vision". Esta semana saíram as revistas MagPI nº 47 e newelectronics de 28 de Junho 2016.</p>

<p>Decorreu no passado fim-de-semana a <a href="http://makerfairelisbon.com/pt/">MakerFaire Lisboa</a> e o altLab foi agraciado com um prémio - uma <a href="https://beeverycreative.com/hellobeeprusa-3d-printer/">Hello BeePrusa</a>! Agradecemos a toda a organização da feira e a todos os que nos visitaram. Fica aqui em registo o momento em que o prémio nos foi entregue.</p>

<p><em>"Every year, the world generates more than 2.7 million tons of a plastic [1], known as polycarbonates, to create common household items, such as CDs, baby bottles, eyeglass lenses and smartphones. Over time, polycarbonates decompose and leach BPA, a chemical that, in 2008, caused retailers to pull plastic baby bottles from store shelves due to concerns about the potential effects of BPA on the brain."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"This Ecma Standard defines the ECMAScript 2016 Language. It is the seventh edition of the ECMAScript Language Specification. Since publication of the first edition in 1997, ECMAScript has grown to be one of the world's most widely used general purpose programming languages. It is best known as the language embedded in web browsers but has also been widely adopted for server and embedded applications. ECMAScript is based on several originating technologies, the most well-known being JavaScript (Netscape) and JScript (Microsoft). The language was invented by Brendan Eich at Netscape and first appeared in that company's Navigator 2.0 browser. It has appeared in all subsequent browsers from Netscape and in all browsers from Microsoft starting with Internet Explorer 3.0."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="NS61_EspressifAnnouncesEsp8285WiFiC.jpg" alt="NS61_EspressifAnnouncesEsp8285WiFiC" /></p>

<p><em>"Espressif announces mass production of the ESP8285 Wi-Fi chip today, adding a new member to Espressif’s Wi-Fi connectivity portfolio. This is a spinoff product of ESP8266, embedded with 1 MByte flash memory and specially designed for wearable devices, such as smartwatches, smart glasses, activity monitors and smart bracelets. According to market research firm IDC, the wearables industry is expected to grow rapidly over the next few years, with unit shipments estimated to exceed 112 million by 2018. Driven by a surging need for flash memory to support the growing range of devices, Espressif has offered a more focused alternative with ESP8285 to meet the demand for smaller PCB size as required in wearable applications. The chip includes an enhanced version of Tensilica’s L106 Diamond series 32-bit processor with flash memory of 1 MByte. Like its predecessor, ESP8285 is a highly integrated Wi-Fi SoC solution that will meet users’ continuous demands for efficient power usage, compact design and reliable performance in the Internet of Things industry."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT61_ResearchersDiscoverNewWayToTur.jpg" alt="CT61_ResearchersDiscoverNewWayToTur" /></p>

<p><em>"When an airplane begins to move faster than the speed of sound, it creates a shockwave that produces a well-known “boom” of sound. Now, researchers at MIT and elsewhere have discovered a similar process in a sheet of graphene, in which a flow of electric current can, under certain circumstances, exceed the speed of slowed-down light and produce a kind of optical “boom”: an intense, focused beam of light. This entirely new way of converting electricity into visible radiation is highly controllable, fast, and efficient, the researchers say, and could lead to a wide variety of new applications. The work is reported today in the journal Nature Communications, in a paper by two MIT professors — Marin Soljačić, professor of physics; and John Joannopoulos, the Francis Wright Davis Professor of physics — as well as postdoc Ido Kaminer, and six others in Israel, Croatia, and Singapore."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"Astronomers using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), detected a clear signal from oxygen in a galaxy located 13.1 billion light-years away from us. This is the most distant oxygen ever detected. Oxygen in this galaxy seems to be ionized by a number of young giant stars, and this detection is a key step to understand the enigmatic “cosmic reionization” in the early history of the Universe. These observations have opened a new window to probe the early Universe with ALMA."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) researchers, along with a team from UC Santa Cruz (UCSC), have devised a method for doubling the performance of 3-D-printed graphene-based supercapacitors. The method, which involves sandwiching lithium ion and perchlorate ion between layers of graphene in aerogel electrodes, substantially improved the capacity of the electrodes while still maintaining the devices' excellent rate capability, the researchers discovered. Their findings were published online (link is external) and are featured as the back cover for the June edition of the journal ChemNanoMat (link is external)"</em></p></li>

<p>Com a disponibilidade de ferramentas que permitem dar azo a nossa imaginação na criação de peças 3D e espaços como o <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/">thingiverse</a> para as publicar, esta rubrica apresenta alguns modelos selecionados que poderão ser úteis.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1641961">Customizable Watering Planter</a></h2>

<p><img src="MP61_CustomizableWateringPlanter.jpg" alt="MP61_CustomizableWateringPlanter" /></p>

<p>Introducing my first customizable object for 3D printing</p>

<p>This Customizable Watering Planter is a solution in order to put your lovely plants in your lovely places. Without to be worried about water spills or forgetting to water the plants. It is easy to use: just plant your favorite plant, add some water, and it is all.</p>

<p>This Customizable Watering Planter was designed to be 3D printed with a minimum requirements, but the most important issue is that It is customizable to cover your own space and necessities. It is composed of two parts: the reservoir and the pot. Both were designed with a regular polygon in mind and a customizable feature under a few parameters.</p>

<p>I have only one recommendation: the height should be greater than the radius.</p>

<p>Be free to skip the instructions if you have experience with the setup of 3D parameters, if not, I recommend you to read it.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1641369">Customizable Bag Clip</a></h2>

<p><img src="MP61_CustomizableBagClip.jpg" alt="MP61_CustomizableBagClip" /></p>

<p>Prints two hinged pieces in one go, so needs a reasonably good printer. Length can be changed using Customizer.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1362673">Educational Brake Caliper</a></h2>

<p><img src="MP61_EducationalBrakeCaliper.jpg" alt="MP61_EducationalBrakeCaliper" /></p>

<p>Since the start of my obsession with 3D printing and computer aided design, Motorsports has been on my mind. The Educational Brake Caliper is my first Motorsports related design to be released to the public.</p>

<p>This caliper is based on a race car style brake caliper featuring quick release brake pads and dual pistons. This caliper is FULL SIZED and was modeled off of a Dwarf Car style Race Car.</p>

<p>Instead of uploading a somewhat complicated design to Pinshape and letting you try to figure out what you have, I've opted to include some significant documentation so that this caliper can be shown and used as a hands-on educational piece. The document can be found with the STL files and is labelled, 'EducationalBrakeCaliper-Final.pdf'.</p>

<p>Along with it being based on an educational design, this caliper fits perfectly on a shelf or a desk as a display showing all of its intricacies with the included display stand.</p>

<p>My intent with the documentation provided will be to help you with printing, assembling, understanding, teaching and testing with this caliper. My suggestion would be to have you thumb through the document before starting this print so you have an idea on how it should go. Thank you</p>

<p><em>"I am a Biomedical Engineering (BME) graduate student at Purdue University. As a BME, I really enjoy making quick and easy projects that highlight some sort of physiological quantity. Heart rate is such an activity. There are numerous projects that deal with detecting a person's heart beat all over the internet. I wanted to put a little spin on such projects. I have created a heart beat detector that blinks an LED when a heart beat is detected. Oftentimes with these measurements, there is a bit of threshold adjustment that takes place when designing algorithms to calculate heart rate. In many DIY projects I have seen, the threshold is manually determined and is often tuned for each person. In my project, the threshold is automatically tuned so that the circuit does not have to be re-calibrated to each user. Again, pretty simple, but fun. Enjoy!"</em></p></li>

<p><em>"Glucose test strips are expensive (especially in the long run) and each type only works for the meter they are made for. This leads to many people not testing enough, since they can't really afford to. The goal of this project is to produce an accurate blood glucose measuring system that does not require special strips from a single manufacturer. A Universal Glucometer would make it possible to use strips from any manufacturer for any meter so you can use any strips that are available, as well as being free to shop for the best priced strips, without having to buy a new meter."</em></p></li>

There are a number of breadboard-friendly modules with all pins exposed (and more coming soon.) However, this post is about the breadboard-unfriendly ESP-01 module. It only has two GPIO pins (four if you include the TX &amp; RX pins), but it's smaller and most importantly, cheaper. US vendors tend to charge around $7, but if you don't mind importing, they can be had for $3.50 or less. The biggest problem with the ESP-01 is that it's annoying to wire up and program, so that's what we're solving today."</em></p></li>

Incorporating the source of stress into projects, by reflecting it creatively, is a good means to change a negative vibe into a positive vibe. The project here has its origins based on a set of decisions, where most of us simply would shake our heads and say "no, they did not just do that, again, did they?". While a first time (bad) decision calls for a facepalm gesture, the second and any subsequent invocation of the gesture can only be adequately described by the term SNAFU"</em></p></li>

You can make a speaker with decent amount of loudness and intensity inside a 9V battery. The idea of making this tiny speaker came to me from a bunch of old batteries. I had a bunch of old dead batteries lying around and was trying to use them in some way or the other but finally ended up with throwing them in the trash. I took a 9V battery and started thinking what could I make with this thing.

Powering the machine is a very useful replacement JAMMA PSU. The JAMMA PSU outputs 5V and 12V which is perfect for this machine. In an effort to save time (and avoid painting) I wrapped the wood body panels in red vinyl to give the machine some color. I also tried covering the aluminum rails with acrylic trim. I came across a pile of scrap  0.22 in thick red acrylic, which is what I used, but from a close inspection 0.125" thick trim would be better here. I found a volume knob from a scrapped Roland keyboard, which looks a bit better for the claw control knob. About 1/2 of people think the claw control is a button, so here's hoping the knob looks more like a knob. I also changed the graphics just slightly. The "Instructions" and Start button now are connected by a blue graphic blob. I hope that draws the eyes to both at the same time. Maybe? I have no idea if that will be the effect."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"Most of my Instructables are based on renewable energy,battery or recycling used materials.In this Instructable, I have tried something new i.e making a simple Arduino based robot car.This is my first try to make a robot in my life. If you have never tried to make robot, you must be thinking its a difficult hobby to jump into, but the Arduino and the 2WD / 4WD Robot Chassis make it easy for you to build an awesome robot without any struggle. I always love to share my knowledge learned from my experience.So writing this guide, it will make easy for you to learn the basics of robotics and applications of the Arduino."</em></p></li>
