<p><em>"Original Apollo 11 guidance computer (AGC) source code for Command Module (Comanche055) and Lunar Module (Luminary099). Digitized by the folks at Virtual AGC and MIT Museum. The goal is to be a repo for the original Apollo 11 source code.

<p><em>"NASA's Curiosity Mars rover is resuming full operations today, following work by engineers to investigate why the rover put itself into a safe standby mode on July 2. The rover team brought Curiosity out of safe mode on July 9. The most likely cause of entry into safe mode has been determined to be a software mismatch in one mode of how image data are transferred on board. Science activity planning for the rover is avoiding use of that mode, which involves writing images from some cameras' memories into files on the rover's main computer. Alternate means are available for handling and transmitting all image data."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"SiFive, the first fabless semiconductor company to build customized, open-source enabled semiconductors, today announced its flagship Freedom family of system on a chip (SoC) platforms. Built around the free and open RISC-V instruction set architecture invented by the company’s founders at the University of California, Berkeley, SiFive’s Freedom U500 and Freedom E300 platforms represent a fundamentally new approach to designing and producing SoCs that redefines traditional silicon business models and reverses the industry’s prohibitively rising licensing, design and implementation costs."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT63_GreenElectronicMaterialsProduc.jpg" alt="CT63_GreenElectronicMaterialsProduc" /></p>

<p><em>"Scientists at the University of Massachusetts Amherst report in the current issue of Small that they have genetically designed a new strain of bacteria that spins out extremely thin and highly conductive wires made up solely of non-toxic, natural amino acids. Researchers led by microbiologist Derek Lovley say the wires, which rival the thinnest wires known to man, are produced from renewable, inexpensive feedstocks and avoid the harsh chemical processes typically used to produce nanoelectronic materials."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT63_GrapheneInfusedPackagingIsAMil.jpg" alt="CT63_GrapheneInfusedPackagingIsAMil" /></p>

<p><em>"Plastic packaging might seem impenetrable — and sometimes nearly impossible to remove — but water molecules can still pass through. And this permeability to moisture can limit the lifespan of a product. To better protect goods such as electronics and medicines, scientists have developed a new kind of packaging that incorporates a single layer of graphene. They report their material, which reduces by a million fold how much water can get through, in the journal ACS Nano. These days, packaging is everywhere, sometimes even on individual fruits or vegetables. Wrapping products from food to electronics in plastic films protects them from dust, bacteria and to some extent water. But to maximize the lifetime of a moisture-sensitive device such as an organic light-emitting diode for more than a year, for example, the packaging must restrict water vapor from entering at a rate of less than 10-6 grams per square meter every day, according to Praveen C. Ramamurthy. Today’s typical packaging is far from achieving that goal. Ramamurthy and colleagues wanted to see whether adding graphene to flexible polymer films would help."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"Today’s robots are awkward co-workers because they are often unable to predict what humans need. In hospitals, robots are employed to perform simple tasks such as delivering supplies and medications, but they have to be explicitly told what to do. A team from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) thinks that this will soon change, and that robots might be most effective by helping humans perform one of the most complex tasks of all: scheduling. In a pair of new papers, CSAIL researchers demonstrate a robot that, by learning from human workers, can help assign and schedule tasks in fields ranging from medicine to the military."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"In an advance that helps pave the way for next-generation electronics and computing technologies—and possibly paper-thin gadgets —scientists with the U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) developed a way to chemically assemble transistors and circuits that are only a few atoms thick. What’s more, their method yields functional structures at a scale large enough to begin thinking about real-world applications and commercial scalability."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://newscenter.lbl.gov/2016/07/04/perovskite-solar-cells/">Discovery Could Dramatically Boost Efficiency of Perovskite Solar Cells</a></p>

<p><img src="CT63_DiscoveryCouldDramaticallyBoos.jpg" alt="CT63_DiscoveryCouldDramaticallyBoos" /></p>

<p><em>"Scientists from the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) have discovered a possible secret to dramatically boosting the efficiency of perovskite solar cells hidden in the nanoscale peaks and valleys of the crystalline material. Solar cells made from compounds that have the crystal structure of the mineral perovskite have captured scientists’ imaginations. They’re inexpensive and easy to fabricate, like organic solar cells. Even more intriguing, the efficiency at which perovskite solar cells convert photons to electricity has increased more rapidly than any other material to date, starting at three percent in 2009—when researchers first began exploring the material’s photovoltaic capabilities—to 22 percent today. This is in the ballpark of the efficiency of silicon solar cells. Now, as reported online July 4 in the journal Nature Energy, a team of scientists from the Molecular Foundry and the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis, both at Berkeley Lab, found a surprising characteristic of a perovskite solar cell that could be exploited for even higher efficiencies, possibly up to 31 percent."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT63_GrapheneFlexesItsMusclesInBois.jpg" alt="CT63_GrapheneFlexesItsMusclesInBois" /></p>

<p><em>"A team of researchers from Boise State University, led by Eric Krueger and David Estrada, have published an article in the American Chemical Society’s Biomaterials Science and Engineering journal. Titled “Graphene Foam as a 3-dimensional Platform for Myotube Growth,” it focuses on a study demonstrating the suitability of graphene foam as a scaffold for growing functional muscle tissue. Graphene foam is an emerging 3D version of graphene, a layer of carbon so thin it is considered 2-dimensional. Ultimately, researchers hope that the unique properties of graphene and graphene foam can be used to regenerate 3-dimensional tissues and organs for implantation into the human body. Past studies have confirmed bone and cartilage growth on graphene foam, but this is the first known study of its compatibility with muscle growth."</em></p></li>

<p>Com a disponibilidade de ferramentas que permitem dar azo a nossa imaginação na criação de peças 3D e espaços como o <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/">thingiverse</a> para as publicar, esta rubrica apresenta alguns modelos selecionados que poderão ser úteis.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:299164">Clock</a></h2>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1673030">G-Clamp fully printable</a></h2>

<p><img src="MP63_GClampFullyPrintable.jpg" alt="MP63_GClampFullyPrintable" /></p>

<p>Inspired by forrozzas beautiful G-Clamp i designed my own version for easy print without support. All parts are redesigned. Smaller clamp is close to specs defined by forrozza.
Additional a larger frame and larger screw is provided which adds another centimeter.
The knob and protector can be reused for the larger clamp.</p>

<p>I gave the screw a fair amount of space, so it should fit without problems into the frame screw hole. Should anyone still have an issue let me know and i can provide an additional version.</p>

<p>The knob and screw needs to be glued or you can squeeze in a piece of paper.</p>

<p>The best way to mount the protector is to use the clamp itself by closing the clamp until the screw ball and protector ball joint clicks together.</p>

<p>For my requirements i used only 25% (~3 hour print) because i need just to hold things in place while the glue is drying. For more force 100% infill is recommended and don't forget it's not made of steel.</p>

<p>Small clamp:
clamp_frame.stl
clamp_screw.stl
clamp_knob.stl
clamp_protector.stl</p>

<p>Large clamp (+1cm):
clamp_frame_long.stl
clamp_screw_long.stl
clamp_knob.stl
clamp_protector.stl</p>

<p>Hope you enjoy
J</p>

<h2>ps.: Added clamp_protector_0.6_loose.stl. The protector will not fall of but be very loose connected.</h2>

<p><em>"Tiny low current 9 VDC Regulated Power supply designed around bipolar transistor and zener diode. The circuit is known as series voltage regulator or emitter follower voltage regulator. The unregulated supply fed to input and the circuit regulate the voltage and provide constant 9V DC, 250mA. The zener diode provides the reference voltage to the base of the transistor. This is very suitable power supply for small projects as it can provide any supply output by changing just the zener diode."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="PM63_SecretKnockGumballMachine.jpg" alt="PM63_SecretKnockGumballMachine" /></p>

<p><em>"One of the best things about exhibiting at Maker Faire is giving attendees a challenge. For the 2010 Maker Faire Bay Area, I decided to combine a past project of mine, a door lock that opens only when you give a secret knock, with a standard crowd pleaser: candy. The result was this Secret-Knock Gumball Machine, which tempted and tested the crowds at Maker Faire to guess the right rhythm and receive a treat. Since the knock was not terribly secret (I happily handed out hints), it distributed hundreds of gumballs over the events two days. The secret knock defaults to the famous Shave and a Haircut rhythm, but you can program custom knocks by simply pressing a button and knocking a new pattern. The machine only listens for the rhythm, not the tempo, so the correct knock will dispense a treat whether you perform it fast or slow."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="PM63_Msp432RgbLedPanelController.jpg" alt="PM63_Msp432RgbLedPanelController" /></p>

<p><em>"This project uses the TI MSP432 ARM MCU to drive the RGB LED panels commonly found on Sparkfun (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12583) and many other electronics sites. The MSP432 has many peripherals that allow me to offload much of the "display management" tasks, freeing up the main CPU to do more graphics processing. This project has involved a whole suite of engineering fun stuff, including PDM modulation for full color, nested timer interrupts and state machines. The MSP432 has a max clock of 48 MHz, which would typically be too slow to do anything fancy with a display, however my preliminary results have been optimistic.

A neuron is a unit making decision on the basis of synapse signal (input 0-1) and a weight (importance) of this signal. Say we have a neuron whose synapse is coming from a soil moisture sensor. Weight (excitation threshold) is the level of the signal by which a neuron knows that the soil is dry enough and needs watering. But every flower has its own comfortable moisture level. That's where a backpropagation can be implemented. By manually watering the flower pot we instruct our neuron what should be the weight of the signal or excitation threshold.

There are many reasons for this, but one of the main causes is within the way an ADC operates. It can not measure a voltage on its own, but only compare it with another voltage. The Arduino offers you to choose from an internal 1.1V, the AVCC system voltage as this reference voltage or an external voltage input. Unfortunately the first two ans simple solutions are far from perfect. The internal reference has an initial accuracy of 10% and an unspecified behavior over the temperature range.
