<p>Nesta semana começou o Google IO 2016 onde foi apresentado um processador desenhado pela Google. Trata-se de um ASIC que é um Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) construído para <em>machine learning</em>. Por sua vez a Amazon, estendeu o conceito do seu <em>Dash Button</em> criando um <em>AWS IoT Button</em> que é programável para fazer o que se entender quando é premido. A Nordic Semiconductor desenvolveu uma nova placa Arduino designada por Primo que incorpora BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy), Wi-Fi, NFC e IR. A NASA lançou um SPB (Balão de Alta Pressão) na Nova Zelândia para um volta ao mundo. O objectivo é testar este tipo de balões para ver se aguenta as condições de uma viagem longa em altitudes médias.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. Na rubrica "Documentação" apresentamos oito livros (eBooks) que podem ser descarregados livremente e que esta semana são sobre Introdução ao R, Aprender a programar com Python, Sinais e Sistemas, Sistemas de Comunicação, Estruturas de Dados e Aanlise Algoritmica em Java e C++, Python intermédio e GNU/Linux Basic.</p>

<p><em>"The AWS IoT Button is a programmable button based on the Amazon Dash Button hardware. This simple Wi-Fi device is easy to configure and designed for developers to get started with AWS IoT, AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon SNS, and many other Amazon Web Services without writing device-specific code. You can code the button's logic in the cloud to configure button clicks to count or track items, call or alert someone, start or stop something, order services, or even provide feedback. For example, you can click the button to unlock or start a car, open your garage door, call a cab, call your spouse or a customer service representative, track the use of common household chores, medications or products, or remotely control your home appliances."</em></p>

<p><em>"Nordic Semiconductor today announces that Arduino – the world’s most successful open-source ecosystem for education, Maker, and Internet of Things (IoT) markets – has specified the Nordic Semiconductor nRF52832 Bluetooth® low energy (previously known as Bluetooth Smart) System-on-Chip (SoC) at the heart of its latest product: a low cost IoT-targeted programmable single board computer (or ‘base board’) called the ‘Arduino Primo’. The Arduino Primo base board features native Bluetooth low energy wireless connectivity and also includes Near Field Communication (NFC), Wi-Fi and infrared (IR) technologies. Previously users were required to add shields – plug-in daughter boards offering additional functionality – to the base board to upgrade to Bluetooth low energy wireless connectivity."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"NASA successfully launched a super pressure balloon (SPB) from Wanaka Airport, New Zealand, at 11:35 a.m. Tuesday, May 17, (7:35 p.m. EDT Monday, May 16) on a potentially record-breaking, around-the-world test flight. The purpose of the flight is to test and validate the SPB technology with the goal of long-duration flight (100+ days) at mid-latitudes. In addition, the gondola is carrying the Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) gamma-ray telescope as a mission of opportunity."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="NS55_GoogleSuperchargesMachineLearn.jpg" alt="NS55_GoogleSuperchargesMachineLearn" /></p>

<p><em>"Machine learning provides the underlying oomph to many of Google’s most-loved applications. In fact, more than 100 teams are currently using machine learning at Google today, from Street View, to Inbox Smart Reply, to voice search. But one thing we know to be true at Google: great software shines brightest with great hardware underneath. That’s why we started a stealthy project at Google several years ago to see what we could accomplish with our own custom accelerators for machine learning applications. The result is called a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), a custom ASIC we built specifically for machine learning — and tailored for TensorFlow. We’ve been running TPUs inside our data centers for more than a year, and have found them to deliver an order of magnitude better-optimized performance per watt for machine learning. This is roughly equivalent to fast-forwarding technology about seven years into the future (three generations of Moore’s Law). TPU is tailored to machine learning applications, allowing the chip to be more tolerant of reduced computational precision, which means it requires fewer transistors per operation. Because of this, we can squeeze more operations per second into the silicon, use more sophisticated and powerful machine learning models and apply these models more quickly, so users get more intelligent results more rapidly. A board with a TPU fits into a hard disk drive slot in our data center racks."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"As one of medicine's largest challenges, viral infections often escape vaccines due to their natural ability to mutate rapidly and develop drug resistance easily. Many viruses, such as Zika, Ebola and dengue fever, have grown into major global health epidemics with great human and economic toll. Today, IBM Research (NYSE: IBM) and Singapore's Institute of Bioengineering, Nanotechnology (IBN) announced they have identified a new breakthrough macromolecule that could help prevent deadly virus infections with a unique triple-play mechanism that can also help prevent viral drug resistance. The study exploits supramolecular chemistry - the study of large molecules designed with multiple features -- to help combat viral infection. The research is believed to be a first of its kind in fighting viral diseases and IBM Watson, along with such experimental breakthroughs, could help further accelerate drug discovery."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"Robots today can perform space missions, solve a Rubik's cube, sort hospital medication and even make pancakes. But most can't manage the simple act of grasping a pencil and spinning it around to get a solid grip. Intricate tasks that require dexterous in-hand manipulation - rolling, pivoting, bending, sensing friction and other things humans do effortlessly with our hands - have proved notoriously difficult for robots. Now, a University of Washington team of computer scientists and engineers has built a robot hand that can not only perform dexterous manipulation but also learn from its own experience without needing humans to direct it. Their latest results are detailed in a paper to be presented May 17 at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation."</em></p></li>

The use of the beer pong table is for beer pong. There are ten LED rings on each side for the ten cups, and then there is an 8*30 matrix of LED's in the center of the table that we can program to make any design we want. We added a microphone, so that we could make the table bass reactive. We also added a rotary switch and 3 buttons so that we could change between designs, change the score for both sides, and turn the LED rings on and off. The rotary switch changes between pre-programmed designs for the center matrix of LED's, two of the buttons change the score for each side which is then displayed in the matrix of LED's, and one button turns the LED rings on and off."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"My plan is to eventually install a considerable number of dismountable panels on a sailboat. For that, they have to be lightweight, efficient, relatively inexpensive, and relatively rugged. For efficiency, I chose monocrystalline wafers and an MPPT charge controller. These wafers are brittle with a relatively large minimum bending radius, so I needed a rigid yet lightweight support. I'm using a plastic honeycomb sandwich with polyester GRP skins. The finished panel with 35 wafers weighs 1.5kg, not including the controller. For redundancy in the face of wafer breakage, I chose a wiring scheme where groups of wafers are wired in parallel and then groups are connected in series. In the prototype, which I completed before finding a controller, there are 7 groups of 5 wafers. Each wafer gives about 0.6V, so that I have a total of about 4V. Failure of a single wafer will not break the series circuit, so that the panel should function with one or more wafers completely cracked. However, I could not find a commercial boost controller with a minimum voltage less than 5V. Chips exist from e.g. Texas Instruments to extract power from a single wafer (or N in parallel), but I chose to build a second prototype panel to connect in series with the first (giving 8V total) rather than design and build a custom controller."</em></p></li>

Ball positioning is only achieved through unstable equilibrium where any small changes in the plate angle will result in the continual acceleration of the ball until it leaves the plate. Such a system presents an interesting controls problem as closed loop control is needed for stable ball positioning on the plate. A good approximation for controlling the balls motion is to decouple the x and y directions on the plate. This allows for two separate independent control loops. One loop controls the x-location of the ball and another controls the y-location. Each control loop for the x and y axis consists of two parts; an inner control loop and an outer loop. The inner loop is responsible for running the stepper motors in closed loop for angle control. Motor angle is obtained from quadrature encoders on each stepper motor. A set angle for the stepper motors is provided from the outer loop and the difference between the set angle and measured angle drives the stepper motor angular velocity."</em></p></li>

I naively thought, stick motors and wheels on each end, an Arduino in the middle, and away it goes. After destroying the can, due to too much cutting and bending, I 3D printed a body. After a few iterations I had a cylinder bot. It turned out that the body would spin more than the wheels (I did not take mechanical engineering 101). Because I didn't want to spend the time implementing the software to control the acceleration rate, I instead added a 3rd wheel in the center which prevents the body from spinning. It also has the desired effect of flip-flopping, something I remembered that one of my kids' RC cars had done. It no longer looks like a sleek cylinder, but because I liked the name, it stuck."</em></p></li>

We build this project with a desire to have more numbers of similar stations in and around our place. so that we will have huge amount of community owned data. We want to reduce the cost as much as possible and don't want to include complex stuff in the project. We chose Arduino as our platform since we can make hardware that is cost effective as well as not much complex."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"Here is a great weekend robotics projects that you can undertake called CupBots based on the Raspberry Pi and the BeagleBone Black which are credit card sized computers and also includes 3D Printing .. Most of the 3D printed parts are common for both the version of the CupBot and are based on earlier version of the CupBot that I posted about a couple of weeks back that you can find at CupBots - 3D Printed Robotic platform for Arduino and Raspberry Pi , which contains an Arduino obstacle avoiding bot and Raspberry Pi Keyboard version.Which mean using the common 3D printed Cup Holder base and the wheels you have make 4 version of the robot as shown in the video below."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"I originally thought this project might be too basic to share on Instructables, but I have since realized there is room for learning at every skill level. I hope you enjoy it. After reading numerous books and experimenting with many tutorials, I decided it was time to apply what I had learned and create my first "from scratch" Arduino project. I wanted to keep it simple but also provide the opportunity to try out some of the new coding techniques I had learned. I came up with the idea of a large-display thermometer that uses an array of colored LEDs to represent the traditional column of liquid. In theory, a completed project of this type could be housed in an enclosure and hung on the wall, where it would be easily readable from a distance."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"We decided that we needed a mirror in our kitchen, and I was also conscious that my family uses their smartphones to check weather, calendar appointments etc before getting the children ready and heading out for the day. I had found numerous great examples of smart mirror tutorials and articles on the web, and I decided to see if I could improve on them using my existing skills as a web developer and some spare kit I had in a drawer (and original Nexus 7). I also wanted the "smart" bit of the mirror to come on only when looked at, so no buttons to touch, voice control (difficult in a sometimes noisy house) and definitely not on all the time. Given that I was using an Android tablet I was able to find all the apps I needed, some paid for, some free, all links below."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"You might have seen my discrete 555 and 741 IC electronics kits. Well, a while back I had this idea about creating a discrete version of a microprocessor, but it just sounded too difficult, time consuming, or impractical. And part of me didn’t want to do it, because it just sounds so tedious to design–at every stage, I was secretly hoping to find a show-stopping problem. But part of me was really interested to see if it could be done. At dinner, Windell and I went through a thought experiment to see if it would even be possible. We weren’t sure how many transistors were in a 6502 (more than 1,000 but less than 10,000). If four surface mount transistors can fit in a square centimeter, then the board would need to be about 1,000 square centimeters, or about 32cm (13in) on a side, which is not as huge as we originally thought. Darn it, time to investigate further! The hard work of reverse engineering the actual 6502 has already been done by the folks at Visual6502.org. I was able to extract the netlist from their Javascript simulation, which contains a list of all the transistors and every single wire connecting them together."</em></p></li>
