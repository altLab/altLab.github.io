<p>Faz hoje anos que nasceu <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Zener">Clarence Zener</a>. Este físico norte-americano nasceu em 1905 e foi o primeiro a descrever a propriedade da separação dos isoladores eléctricos. Estes estudos conduziram mais tarde à criação de um Diodo que ficou designado por Diodo Zener. Também faz hoje anos que nascia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Heinrich_Klaproth">Martin Heinrich Klaproth</a>. Este químico alemão nascido em 1743, ficou conhecido por ter descoberto o elemento urânio, o zircónio e o cério.
Esta semana a Intel apresentou a sua estratégia para a "Smart Home" ou casa Inteligente. O cargueiro Soyuz-U lançado a partir do BAIKONUR Space Center explodiu ao fim de 382 segundos de voo. Este cargueiro sem tripulação ia fazer uma entrega de mantimentos à ISS. Uma equipa de cientistas designada por PartTimeScientists estão a preparar uma viagem à Lua para revisitar o local onde aterrou a Apollo 17 em 1972. A startup Comma.ai do hacker Geohot disponibilizou em open-source o seu software de condução autónoma.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como alguns modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis. Saíram as revistas Newselectronic de 21 e 22 de Novembro.</p>

<p><em>"Smart home is a term that is likely well known by anyone who follows technology as closely as I do, and even people who don’t. But do people really understand what a smart home is today versus what it could be in the future? In my position as corporate vice president of the Connected Home and Commercial Client Group at Intel, I lead Intel’s smart home strategy. My colleagues and I see innumerable opportunities to innovate and create solutions that can enrich our lives in the homes, neighborhoods and communities we all share. The Internet of Things (IoT), edge analytics platforms, home connectivity and personal computing devices all play a role, and we can create amazing experiences when we collaborate."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/getting-across-threshold/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Soyuz-U launch vehicle (LV) with cargo spacecraft Progress MS-04 was launched from the BAIKONUR Space Center. The LV flight was normal until 382-d seconds. After 382 seconds of flight the receiving Progress MS-04 telemetry data was stopped. Radar stations did not detect the cargo vehicle Progress MS-04 on the calculated orbit. According to preliminary information, the contingency took place at an altitude of about 190 km over remote and unpopulated mountainous area of the Republic of Tyva. The most of cargo spacecraft fragments burned in the dense atmosphere. The State Commission is conducting analysis of the current contingency. The loss of the cargo ship will not affect the normal operations of the ISS and the life of the station crew."</em> <a href="http://en.roscosmos.ru/20663/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"The Apollo 17 landing site has been abandoned since the last lunar astronauts went home in 1972. Now the site could get its first visitor in 44 years, as private companies race to the moon in the Google Lunar Xprize competition. A German team known as the PartTimeScientists plans to send its rovers to the Apollo 17 landing site and examine the moon buggy left behind by astronauts Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt. PartTimeScientists is the fourth team to book a flight to the moon. A rocket rideshare company called Spaceflight Inc. is handling the launch contract.

<p><em>"George Hotz became well-known for being the first to come up with an iPhone jailbreak and reverse-engineering the PlayStation 3 gaming console — which led to a widely publicized legal battle with Sony. Capitalizing on his fame, he turned his attention to more ambitious endeavors, building his own aftermarket device to give any relatively modern car advanced autopilot features. The device, dubbed Comma One, was set to retail at $999 and included front radar sensors and a camera. But after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) sent Hotz a letter in October asking him to detail how the product works and the steps taken by the company for safety compliance, the project came to an abrupt end. Hotz claimed he would much rather spend his life building amazing tech than dealing with regulators and lawyers, and that Comma.ai would look to other products and markets."</em> <a href="http://www.techspot.com/news/67250-geohot-startup-commaai-open-sources-self-driving-software.html">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"All our smart phones have shiny flat AMOLED displays. Behind each single pixel of these displays hide at least two silicon transistors which were mass-manufactured using laser annealing technologies. While the traditional methods to make them uses temperatures above 1,000°C, the laser technique reaches the same results at low temperatures even on plastic substrates (melting temperature below 300°C). Interestingly, a similar procedure can be used to generate crystals of graphene. Graphene is a strong and thin nano-material made of carbon, its electric and heat-conductive properties have attracted the attention of scientists worldwide. Prof. KEON Jae Lee's research group at the Center for Multidimensional Carbon Materials within the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) and Prof. CHOI Sung-Yool's team at KAIST discovered graphene synthesis mechanism using laser-induced solid-state phase separation of single-crystal silicon carbide (SiC). This study, available on Nature Communications, clarifies how this laser technology can separate a complex compound (SiC) into its ultrathin elements of carbon and silicon."</em> <a href="http://www.ibs.re.kr/cop/bbs/BBSMSTR_000000000738/selectBoardArticle.do?nttId=13928">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2016/november/diamond-power.html">‘Diamond-age’ of power generation as nuclear batteries developed</a></h2>

<p><em>"New technology has been developed that uses nuclear waste to generate electricity in a nuclear-powered battery. A team of physicists and chemists from the University of Bristol have grown a man-made diamond that, when placed in a radioactive field, is able to generate a small electrical current. The development could solve some of the problems of nuclear waste, clean electricity generation and battery life. This innovative method for radioactive energy was presented at the Cabot Institute’s sold-out annual lecture - ‘Ideas to change the world’- on Friday, 25 November. Unlike the majority of electricity-generation technologies, which use energy to move a magnet through a coil of wire to generate a current, the man-made diamond is able to produce a charge simply by being placed in close proximity to a radioactive source."</em> <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2016/november/diamond-power.html">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"A complete rewrite of my customizable hinge! The new version is immensely more printable and quite possibly over parameterized. No longer do you need to break it free, as long as the hinge gap parameter is set to something your printer can handle it should hinge easily right off of the bed! Major changes from the old version include using angled interfaces between the hinge points instead of a solid pin to provide improved printability and much more flexibility for the screw holes."</em> <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1931310">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"I was learning OpenSCAD and wanted to make an enclosure for an electronics project. Rather than create a box each time I thought it would make more sense to have a "library" file which could create the box I needed and be re-usable. This box could also be printed as-is to hold nearly anything. It will make a square-edged box, one with radiused corners, or a stylized version with two rounded and two squared corners opposing. It will optionally create vent holes; either round holes or square. A note about the $fn=200; parameter. This will greatly smooth all radiused surfaces. It will also kill your processor. My poor i7-4800MQ takes about 30 minutes to render the circular holed option when this is enabled. I highly suggest you leave it commented until you are ready to export your final .STL. Final thought: This renders properly but does not seem to like to preview. I've seen this a lot. If anyone knows why that is; I'm all ears."</em> <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1918169">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Customize your own part bin whether its for that load of loose screws you keep around 'just in case' or tiny electronic components they will no longer go missing. This box is made for the ultimate plastic scrimper and all the walls can be paper thin as the box will still be supported by columns (however I would still recommend 2 layers). Easy to print with no overhangs over 45o and box can be stacked several high if they are the same dimensions.

<h2><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Localino-Open-Source-Indoor-Location-System-Arduin/">Localino: Open Source Indoor Location System (Arduino + Decawave)</a></h2>

<p><em>"This instructable explains how to build an indoor location system with centimeter accuracy for &lt;$ 200 using ultra wideband. do it yourself. Most indoor location systems make use of wifi, bluetooth, wifi fingerprinting etc and show accuracies within several meters. Ultra wideband systems offer high accuracy (cm range), due to wide signal bandwidth. However, these UWB systems are very expensive, so for a setup where you want to localize something in your project (for example maneuver your lawnmower) you can easily spend > $1000 or more.

<p><em>"This instructable describes how you can build your own soil moisture sensor. There are a lot of instructables online about soil moisture sensors, but not that much about a self-made capacitor for measuring soil moisture content. With the simple resistance measuring, the biggest issue is the corrosion of the metal sensor, not just because it contacts the wet soil, but also because of the electric current which causes electrolysis of the sensor. Feeding the sensor with an AC or a pulsating DC may fix this problem for a little, but we prefer to make a capacitor as a soil moisture sensor. There are some advantages to a capacitor. You avoid corrosion , but capacitive measuring also gives a better reading of the moisture content of the soil in comparison with the resistance measurement. The electrical conductivity of the soil is increased by salts, so fertilizers added to the ground may result in incorrect readings. The capacitor that we build will measure the time that is necessary to charge the sensor. The charging time will increase if either the resistance or the capacity increases. The resistance is constant and the capacitance increases if there is water between(or around) the sensor, because the relative permittivity of the dielectric material increases."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Capacative-Soil-Moisture-Sensor-self-made/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"n this Instructable, I will show my Arduino-controlled buck/boost/inverter converter. And what means that "true" in the title, you ask? Well, you have probably already seen a tutorial where somebody just connected a transistor to the PWM output of an Arduino along with a few other parts and called that a buck/boost/inverter converter (for example here). I admit it, I also used it once in my AVR Universal Charger. It works OK when your load is not changing, but if your load rapidly changes, the controller can't react fast enough and this can lead to a very dangerous over-/under-voltage. So generally this is a very bad idea. A much better way is to use a chip designed exactly for this purpose. Here, we will use TL494 from Texas Instruments. You can find this chip in most computer power supplies or even classical converters. But did you know that we can control the output of the chip from an Arduino? Basically our Arduino will tell the chip what output voltage and max current we want and the chip will do all the hard work, so we do not have to care about Arduino latency. Also, because this chip is analog (compared to digital Arduino), it is superior as far as accuracy goes."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-controlled-True-Switching-Regulators/">[...]</a></p>

I was inspired to work on this project after posting this Instructable here which used a single colour LED strip with a dimmer and an audio pulsing circuit.
