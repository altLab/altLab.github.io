<p>Esta semana ficamos a saber que afinal a Atmel foi comprada pela Microchip e não pela Dialog Semiconductor. Foi encontrado o maior número primo com cerca de 22 milhões de dígitos e que é um número "Mersenne". A Samsung começou a produzir DRAM de 4-gigabyte baseada na tecnologia de segunda geração HBM2 para ser usada em computação de alto desempenho.</p>

<p>Esta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker e na rubrica "Documentação" apresentamos quatro livros (eBooks) que podem ser descarregados livremente e que esta semana são sobre o Projecto Oberon: O desenho de um sistema operativo, de um compilador e de um computador, um livro sobre Algoritmos, um sobre VHDL e por fim um livro sobre sistemas operativos e <em>middleware</em>. Falamos também em duas revista de electrónica: a newelectronics e a Electronics Maker.</p>

<p><img src="NS38_MicrochipTechnologyIncAcquires.jpg" alt="NS38_MicrochipTechnologyIncAcquires" /></p>

<p><em>"Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading provider of microcontroller, mixed-signal, analog and Flash-IP solutions,
and Atmel Corporation today announced that Microchip has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Atmel for $8.15 per share in a combination of cash and Microchip common stock. The acquisition price represents a total equity value of about $3.56 billion, and a total enterprise value of about $3.40 billion, after excluding Atmel’s cash and investments net of debt on its balance sheet of approximately $155.0 million at December 31, 2015."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="NS38_LargestKnownPrimeNumber2274207.jpg" alt="NS38_LargestKnownPrimeNumber2274207" /></p>

<p><em>"The Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS) celebrated its 20th anniversary with the math discovery of the new largest known prime number, 274,207,281-1, having 22,338,618 digits, on a university computer volunteered by Curtis Cooper for the project. The same GIMPS software just uncovered a flaw in Intel's latest Skylake CPUs, and its global network of CPUs peaking at 450 trillion calculations per second remains the longest continuously-running 'grassroots supercomputing' project in Internet history. The new prime number, also known as M74207281, is calculated by multiplying together 74,207,281 twos then subtracting one. It is almost 5 million digits larger than the previous record prime number, in a special class of extremely rare prime numbers known as Mersenne primes. It is only the 49th known Mersenne prime ever discovered, each increasingly difficult to find. Mersenne primes were named for the French monk Marin Mersenne, who studied these numbers more than 350 years ago. GIMPS, founded in 1996, has discovered all 15 of the largest known Mersenne primes. Volunteers download a free program to search for these primes with a cash award offered to anyone lucky enough to compute a new prime. Prof. Chris Caldwell maintains an authoritative web site on the largest known primes and is an excellent history of Mersenne primes."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="NS38_SamsungBeginsMassProducingWorl.jpg" alt="NS38_SamsungBeginsMassProducingWorl" /></p>

<p><em>"Samsung Electronics announced that it has begun mass producing the industry’s first 4-gigabyte (GB) DRAM package based on the second-generation High Bandwidth Memory (HBM2) interface, for use in high performance computing (HPC), advanced graphics and network systems, as well as enterprise servers. Samsung’s new HBM solution will offer unprecedented DRAM performance – more than seven times faster than the current DRAM performance limit, allowing faster responsiveness for high-end computing tasks including parallel computing, graphics rendering and machine learning."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT38_ZinniaFlowersStartingToGrowOnT.jpg" alt="CT38_ZinniaFlowersStartingToGrowOnT" /></p>

<p><em>"Zinnia flowers are starting to grow in the International Space Station's Veggie facility as part of the VEG-01 investigation. Veggie provides lighting and nutrient supply for plants in the form of a low-cost growth chamber and planting "pillows” to provide nutrients for the root system. These plants appear larger than their ground-based counterparts and scientists expect buds to form on the larger plants soon."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT38_OutsidersCrack50YearOldMathPro.jpg" alt="CT38_OutsidersCrack50YearOldMathPro" /></p>

<p><em>"In 2008, Daniel Spielman told his Yale University colleague Gil Kalai about a computer science problem he was working on, concerning how to “sparsify” a network so that it has fewer connections between nodes but still preserves the essential features of the original network. Network sparsification has applications in data compression and efficient computation, but Spielman’s particular problem suggested something different to Kalai. It seemed connected to the famous Kadison-Singer problem, a question about the foundations of quantum physics that had remained unsolved for almost 50 years. Over the decades, the Kadison-Singer problem had wormed its way into a dozen distant areas of mathematics and engineering, but no one seemed to be able to crack it. The question “defied the best efforts of some of the most talented mathematicians of the last 50 years,” wrote Peter Casazza and Janet Tremain of the University of Missouri in Columbia, in a 2014 survey article."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT38_SpintronicsLowEnergyElectricit.jpg" alt="CT38_SpintronicsLowEnergyElectricit" /></p>

<p><em>"Topological insulators are recently discovered materials that differ from the familiar insulators and semiconductors in many ways. While topological insulators are fascinating for fundamental physics, they could one day enable electricity with less energy loss, spintronics, and perhaps even quantum computing. Combining theory with experiment, EPFL scientists have now identified bismuth iodide as a topological insulator and the first representative of a whole new structural class of materials that could propel topological insulators into applications. The work, which was carried out within the framework of the EPFL-led NCCR Marvel project, is published in Nature Materials."</em></p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.projectoberon.com/">Project Oberon: The Design of an Operating System, a Compiler, and a Computer</a> by Niklaus Wirth and Jürg Gutknecht</p>

</ul>

<p><em>"This book presents the results of Project Oberon, namely an entire software environment for a modern workstation. The project was undertaken by the authors in the years 1986-89, and its primary goal was to design and implement an entire system from scratch, and to structure it in such a way that it can be described, explained, and understood as a whole. In order to become confronted with all aspects, problems, design decisions and details, the authors not only conceived but also programmed the entire system described in this book, and more. "</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/Algorithms.pdf">Algorithms</a></p>

<p><em>"This book aims to be an accessible introduction into the design and analysis of efficient algorithms. Throughout the book we will introduce only the most basic techniques and describe the rigorous mathematical methods needed to analyze them."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://freerangefactory.org/pdf/free_range_vhdl.pdf">Free Range VHDL</a></p>

<p><em>"The purpose of this book is to provide students and young engineers with a guide to help them develop the skills necessary to be able to use VHDL for introductory and intermediate level digital design. These skills will also give you the ability and the confidence to continue on with VHDL-based digital design. In this way, you will also take steps toward developing the skills required to implement more advanced digital design systems. Although there are many books and on-line tutorials dealing with VHDL, these sources are often troublesome for several reasons. Firstly, much of the information regarding VHDL is either needlessly confusing or poorly written. Material with these characteristics seems to be written from the standpoint of someone who is either painfully intelligent or has forgotten that their audience may be seeing the material for the first time. Secondly, the common approach for most VHDL manuals is to introduce too many topics and a lot of extraneous information too early. Most of this material would best appear later in the presentation. Material presented in this manner has a tendency to be confusing, is easily forgotten if misunderstood or simply is never applied. The approach taken by this book is to provide only what you need to know to quickly get up and running in VHDL. As with all learning, once you have obtained and applied some useful information, it is much easier to build on what you know as opposed to continually adding information that is not directly applicable to the subjects at hand."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://gustavus.edu/mcs/max/os-book/osm-rev1.2.pdf">Operating Systems and Middleware: Supporting Controlled Interaction</a></p>

<p><em>"Intended for juniors, seniors, and first-year graduate students, Max Hailperin's Operating Systems and Middleware: Supporting Controlled Interaction takes a modern approach to the traditional Operating Systems course. By using this innovative text, students will obtain an understanding of how contemporary operating systems and middleware work, and why they work that way. They will also gain practical skills including the ability to reason about and program concurrent computations, understand hardware/software interactions, use empirical measurement to guide design, and analyze system security."</em></p></li>

<h1 id="Modelos-3D">Modelos 3D <a href="#topo">^</a></h1>

<p>Com a disponibilidade de ferramentas que permitem dar azo a nossa imaginação na criação de peças 3D e espaços como o <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/">thingiverse</a> para as publicar, esta rubrica apresenta alguns modelos selecionados que poderão ser úteis.</p>

<h2>Credit card ruler (<a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1279498">http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1279498</a>)</h2>

<p><img src="MP38_CreditCardRuler.jpg" alt="Modelos3D_1_Creditcardruler" /></p>

<p>This is a simple tool that might prove useful. I remembered when I still had technical drawing classes that I once forgot my ruler and my protractor. This could have saved me. So here it is ! Sweet revenge :D</p>

<p>Comes in two versions, a thin and a thick one, you be the judge</p>

<p>No excuses now !</p>

<h2>Customizable Cover for LCD (<a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1274664">http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1274664</a>)</h2>

<p><img src="MP38_CustomizableCoverForLcd.jpg" alt="Modelos3D_2_CustomizableCoverForLCD" /></p>

<p>Designed to be glued to the front of the machine. Can customize size of the screen and borders.</p>

<h2>Customizable Swivel Buckle (<a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1172650">http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1172650</a>)</h2>

<p><img src="MP38_CustomizableSwivelBuckle.jpg" alt="Modelos3D_3_CustomizableSwivelBuckle" /></p>

<p>I've been looking for a easy-to-print, low-volume, low-profile snap buckle that would work scaled up to 4"... spope's swivel buckles don't scale, but the basic design kick-started my brain enough that I threw together this simplified parametric design which should do the trick (update: yup).</p>

<p>Update Dec 8/15: adjusted the post geometry for easier/stronger printing (tapers work better if they start a few layer off the build platform), tweaked the tooth design.</p>

<p>Update Dec 11/15: made customizable, minor tuning, cleaned up magic numbers</p>

Unfortunately, these devices are very expensives for students starting electronics, or makers who want use electronic circuits in their creations just once... The idea of my project is to rethink your smartphone as a portable, powerful and secured platform, able to simulate an oscilloscope and a signal generator for your electronic circuits. Here, your phone isn't just an accessorize or an ordinairy remote control : it becomes the center of the project, and a tool to help you create better things in the future."</em></p>

And so my story began... :) This laser engraver uses a 1.8W 445nm laser module, of course, this is nothing compared to the industrial laser cutters who use lasers of (a lot) more than 50W. But this laser will do well for us. It can cut through paper and cardboard and it can engrave all kinds of wood. I haven't tested other materials yet, but I'm sure it can engrave many other materials. l will let you know! It has a large engraving surface of about 500x380mm."</em></p>

The pins are directly designed to work with these bread boards, and unlike the usual pin strips found on other processor boards, they plug in easily to the bread board, and don’t damage it. Unlike other processor boards that are far larger, OSHChip can be plugged into the middle two rows of a bread board, and it doesn’t cover the connected holes that you will be connecting to."</em></p>

It was easy to duplicate and I’ve made a few changes, additions, and such that seemed worth documenting. I didn’t have a signal generator other than the 1kHz square wave on my oscilloscope and some clunky code that I wrote for a microcontroller so I ordered an inexpensive AD9850 and hooked it up to a FR6989 LP so I could use the LCD to display frequency.  I’ve been pleased with the AD9850 and it is hard to beat it for the price.  The sine wave is more than sufficient for my needs up to 40 MHz – I don’t see any deviation from the scope."</em></p>

I realized that the holes on the socket are exactly 5 mm in diameter. What are 5 mm in diameter too? Of course, LEDs!
