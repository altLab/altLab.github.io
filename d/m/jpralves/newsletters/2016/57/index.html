<p><img src="NS57_SamsungMassProducingIndustrysF.jpg" alt="NS57_SamsungMassProducingIndustrysF" /></p>

<p><em>"Samsung Electronics, the world leader in advanced memory technology, announced today that it has begun mass producing the industry’s first NVMe* PCIe solid state drive (SSD) in a single ball grid array (BGA) package, for use in next-generation PCs and ultra-slim notebook PCs. The new BGA NVMe SSD, named PM971-NVMe, features an extremely compact package that contains all essential SSD components including NAND flash memory, DRAM and controller while delivering outstanding performance."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="NS57_NewArmCortexA73ProcessorDrives.jpg" alt="NS57_NewArmCortexA73ProcessorDrives" /></p>

<p><em>"Consider this: The performance of smartphones, nearly all of which are powered by ARM processors, has grown by 100x since 2009. One hundred times in seven years! With that has emerged entirely new functionality, lightning-fast user responsiveness, and immersive user experiences – all in the same power footprint. It’s really an unrivaled engineering achievement, given the challenging design constraints in the mobile space. This performance, functionality and user experience dynamic has driven a truly remarkable market, which will see more than 1.5 billion handsets sold in 2016. With this consumer embrace, smart phone design has become, in many ways, the platform for future innovation. Augmented and virtual reality, ultra-HD visualization, object-based audio processing or computer vision all underlie the demand for extra system performance. At the same time, smart phone designs have slimmed considerably in recently years, which limits thermal dissipation and ratchets up the need for thoughtful power management design. Battery capacity improvement cannot continue as smartphones have gotten as large as they practically can. To continue delivering more immersive user experiences and staying on the smartphone innovation path we’ve blazed in the past decade, we need to deliver more sustained performance with higher efficiency."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"Microchip Technology Inc., a leading provider of microcontroller, mixed-signal, analog and Flash-IP solutions, today announced the MPLAB® Harmony Graphics Composer (MHGC), a modern and flexible graphical user interface (GUI) composer tool. MHGC is a free development tool for developing GUIs for all PIC32 microcontrollers through Microchip’s Harmony Configurator and MPLAB X Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The software allows anyone to create branded content using the Harmony Graphics Library, in conjunction with their custom assets, to create GUIs in a What-You-See-is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) design model, without complex and cumbersome coding."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT57_SenseonicsReceivesCeMarkForImp.jpg" alt="CT57_SenseonicsReceivesCeMarkForImp" /></p>

<p><em>"Senseonics' offering is a pill-sized sensor that is entirely implanted in the user’s upper arm so that it can continuously monitor their glucose levels. The device is meant to last at least 90 days before it needs to be replaced — in contrast to the five to seven days that current not-quite-so-invasive CGMs last. Goodnow said the company would begin commercialization in Sweden in partnership with the company’s exclusive distributor, Rubin Medical."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2016/may/skintrack-technology.html">Skintrack technology turns arm into smartwatch touchpad</a></p>

<p><img src="CT57_SkintrackTechnologyTurnsArmInt.jpg" alt="CT57_SkintrackTechnologyTurnsArmInt" /></p>

<p><em>"Ever since the advent of smartwatches, technologists have been looking to expand interactions beyond the confines of the small watch face. A new wearable technology developed at Carnegie Mellon University suggests turning the entire lower arm into a touchpad. Called SkinTrack and developed by the Human-Computer Interaction Institute’s Future Interfaces Group, the new system allows for continuous touch tracking on the hands and arms. It also can detect touches at discrete locations on the skin, enabling functionality similar to buttons or slider controls. Previous “skin to screen” approaches have employed flexible overlays, interactive textiles and projector/camera combinations that can be cumbersome. SkinTrack, by contrast, requires only that the user wear a special ring, which propagates a low-energy, high-frequency signal through the skin when the finger touches or nears the skin surface."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/view-from-the-valley/biomedical/diagnostics/forget-the-brick-this-power-supply-for-wearables-is-soft-stretchable-and-solarpowered">Forget the “Brick”, This Power Supply for Wearables Is Soft, Stretchable, and Solar-Powered</a></p>

<p><img src="CT57_ForgetTheBrickThisPowerSupplyF.jpg" alt="CT57_ForgetTheBrickThisPowerSupplyF" /></p>

<p><em>"Skin-like wearables—sensors and other electronics that can be worn comfortably for days at a time because they stretch and feel just like skin—made a big splash at CES. But the first generation of these “electronic tattoos” are externally powered, that is, they harvest RF energy to respond to an external reader. That’s fine for a limited range of applications, when you want to make spot checks of somebody’s temperature, say. For anything else, though, wearables need power on board—that means batteries and some way to charge them. But, to date, a power supply has represented the antithesis of soft, conforming, skinlike electronics: we don’t call an external power supply a brick for nothing."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/science-tech/milestone-solar-cell-efficiency-unsw-engineers">Milestone in solar cell efficiency by UNSW engineers</a></p>

<p><img src="CT57_MilestoneInSolarCellEfficiency.jpg" alt="CT57_MilestoneInSolarCellEfficiency" /></p>

<p><em>"A new solar cell configuration developed by engineers at the University of New South Wales has pushed sunlight-to-electricity conversion efficiency to 34.5% – establishing a new world record for unfocused sunlight and nudging closer to the theoretical limits for such a device. The record was set by Dr Mark Keevers and Professor Martin Green, Senior Research Fellow and Director, respectively, of UNSW’s Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics, using a 28-cm2 four-junction mini-module – embedded in a prism – that extracts the maximum energy from sunlight. It does this by splitting the incoming rays into four bands, using a hybrid four-junction receiver to squeeze even more electricity from each beam of sunlight."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://wyss.harvard.edu/viewpage/457">Autonomous Flying Microrobots (RoboBees)</a></p>

<p><img src="CT57_AutonomousFlyingMicrorobotsRob.jpg" alt="CT57_AutonomousFlyingMicrorobotsRob" /></p>

<p><em>"There is nothing we can take off-the-shelf to create the tiny flapping wings required to mimic the flight of insects. New technologies must be explored to overcome challenges for microfabrication, artificial muscles, bio-inspired sensors, compact power storage, ultra low power computing, and programming methods for a colony of artificial insects. Inspired by the biology of a bee, researchers at the Wyss Institute, Harvard's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) and Northeastern University are developing RoboBees, man-made systems that could perform myriad roles in agriculture or disaster relief. A Robobee measures about half the size of a paper clip, weighs less than one-tenth of a gram, and flies using “artificial muscles” comprised of materials that contract when a voltage is applied."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.news.virginia.edu/content/uva-discovers-fountain-youth-gene-helps-prevent-heart-attack-stroke">UVA Determines ‘Fountain of Youth’ Gene Helps Prevent Heart Attack, Stroke</a></p>

<p><img src="CT57_UvaDeterminesFountainOfYouthGe.jpg" alt="CT57_UvaDeterminesFountainOfYouthGe" /></p>

<p><em>"A gene that scientific dogma insists is inactive in adults actually plays a vital role in preventing the underlying cause of most heart attacks and strokes, researchers at the University of Virginia School of Medicine have determined. The findings open a new avenue for battling those deadly conditions and raise the tantalizing prospect that doctors could use the gene to prevent or delay at least some of the effects of aging."</em></p></li>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1586802">Pocket Calipers</a></h2>

<p><img src="MP57_PocketCalipers.jpg" alt="MP57_PocketCalipers" /></p>

<p>I find myself thinking about different things to make throughout the day, but I only have calipers on me when I'm at home, so I'm left to a best guess. Now, with these handy little pocket calipers, that best guess just got even better! Obviously there's no way to get these as accurate as some digital calipers, but these will allow you to get very close measurements up to 50mm (width) and 40mm (depth). There is even a screw to hold your position in case you can't write your measurement down right away. Hopefully these will come in handy for makers all over.</p>

<p>All three pieces are already in the proper orientation for printing and nothing needs supports! Make sure you leave the right side upside down unless you plan on adding supports yourself.</p>

<p>Students and makers of all ages can use this project to learn how to use a pair of calipers as well as the importance of tolerances between parts. Not to mention, the importance of printing in very low layer heights and printing text vertically to preserve its quality.</p>

<p>It is a very simple project and even novice makers and students should be able to complete this project easily.</p>

<p>I printed this in just over an hour, so it has potential to be used as a classroom or maker space project. Assembly takes about 1 minute.</p>

<p>This is my very first thing and my entry into the #MakerEdChallenge2.</p>

<p><img src="MP57_SnapTogetherModelMountainBike.jpg" alt="MP57_SnapTogetherModelMountainBike" /></p>

<p>About a year ago, I created a model road bike, that printed out in one sheet and snapped together. It's been pretty popular, so I thought it could use a companion for those of us who prefer to take their desk toys off-road. I hope you all enjoy it!</p>

<p>printing and assembling process is the same as the road bike, however due to the larger tires and frame this takes about twice as long (about 1hr on my printer, your mileage may vary). However, the fit of the parts should be better than before, and the parts are more detailed. Like the road bike, a knife is recommended to help separate the parts and clean them up, and a bit of superglue doesn't hurt.</p>

<p>If you want to display it more prominently, you should also print out my Snap-together model Bike Stand.</p>

<p><em>"TeleBall is a handheld game console. You cannot buy it. You need to build it by yourself. It lets you play BreakOut in single-player mode using one device and Tennis for Two in multi-player mode using two devices communicating via radio. TeleBall is pretty retro and very minimalistic: It features an 8x8 pixel LED matrix display, a paddle as game controller and one button. Therefore, the range of possible games is limited but you will be surprised how much fun and even zenlike meditation this kind of gameplay can bring you, particularly when you play Tennis for Two with a friend."</em></p></li>

And what better initial project with it than twisted lamps using 2812s to allow whatever colors I want. (Rainbows. Of course.) The CRASH Space art show was coming up, so I decided to make a set of lanterns to hang in the hallway and react to people walking beneath them.

There will be no 3D printing..C.A.D or anything of the such, we are going back to the 80's at the height of animatronics with this system design (minus arduino and processing control of course). In order to keep the cost down we will be using what may be considered non-standard design. The objective of this tutorial is to create a simple autonomous animatronic characters that will run a constant high variable loop which will produce some interesting features. I will also create a simple controller for the mouse so you will be able to take this element out of autonomous control and into man operation smoothly for more focused mouth function. This may be useful if you want to make a character that needs to manually replicate voice output for the character. I want to state here that the objective of this project is not to create something super polished and smooth, but fun and hopefully open you up to thinking about how you could adapt the foundation of this system for yourself.

It makes use an Adafruit touchscreen interface and a Sim900 GSM/GPRS module to make phone calls. Its more of a proof of concept to see what could be done with a relatively small form factor with off-the-shelf (cheap) components. I dont expect everyone to be rushing out to build this one, but I had great fun in doing it, as it builds quite nicely on my previous projects, especially the Lapse Pi, a touchscreen time-lapse controller, and uses most of the same hardware. What makes this different from the Timelapse controller is the addition of a a SIM900 GSM module, which is connected via UART to the Raspberry Pi. Also, I got myself a LiPo battery that would fit nicely between the TFT screen and the Raspberry Pi, so it could be used standalone, without any wires hanging off it whatsoever.

Later on, the laptop will be replaced by a Raspberry Pi or other Linux based computer board, but for now it easier for me to develop everything in Matlab and then convert the code to C/C++ or something else in the future.

<p><em>"Microcontrollers are becoming the core of many electronic projects for hobbyists and the norm in electronic design overall. With the complexity of projects increasing and the introduction of the IoT, it will not be long before micro users will need to also increase the capabilities of microcontrollers. A common use for microcontrollers is to log data from sensors such as temperature, humidity, and other stimuli. This data can be streamed to an I2C EEPROM and then read back when this data is to be sent to an external server (via the IoT). If the user wishes to store separate instances of data (for example, different times of the day), then the memory needs to contain information regarding the time the data was sent and how the memory is organised. While the user could design a system to cope with such matters, it would be easier to implement a file system such as FAT. However, many micros are not capable of using the FAT file system because of the memory requirements."</em></p></li>

The article was quite nice with a lot of information on the hardware i however did not want to buy an extra touch screen as was used in that build.... and running it through command line sounded pretty insane, so i went on to a quest to do something about it :) A couple of evenings later, there was a solution i put together a little web app that runs on a nodeJS server on the PI which can then be accessed through the browser on your mobile device if it is sharing its wifi with the raspberry. Since i also had hell of a time trying to piece the whole picture together when building the hardware, i also figured i should create a dumb down guide which someone with very little knowledge on the subject should be able to follow."</em></p></li>

And a few simple IP cameras also used for time lapse, all a bit inaccessible. And my modem/router that comes from the ISP gets the slow internet syndrome every now and then."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"In this Instructables guide I will show you how to make your own password security system by using the Arduino uno board and some magnetic door switches. I made my own circuit by using the ATmega328 micro controller but this is an optional step. In this guide I will help you to make it easily on breadboard by using the Arduino uno board, and I will give you some extra tips on how you can make your own Arduino-based custom circuit. By using this system you will be able to arm and disarm the security system. You can disarm it by typing the correct password and pressing the '*' button. If you want to change the current password, you can do it by pressing the 'B' button, and if you want to skip or abort an operation you can do it by pressing the '#' button. It also has a buzzer for making various tones during operation."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="PM57_AnalogInputProtectionCircuit.jpg" alt="PM57_AnalogInputProtectionCircuit" /></p>

<p><em>"Analog input pins are a common feature of many microcontroller boards. However, due to the operating voltage of the board, you are limited to a maximum analog input voltage (1.8V, 3.3V, 5V), beyond which you will end up frying your board. But that low voltage range is pretty restrictive if you would like to apply some of the functionality of a microcontroller to a measurement outside that range. To get around this, you can create an analog input protection circuit to allow you to make measurements on higher voltages, while minimizing the risk of frying your pin or whole board. Here I will go over the design method I used to create a voltage divider and diode clamp to protect an analog input pin on a uC32 microcontroller, but these concepts can be applied to creating a circuit for any board. A basic knowledge of circuit theory and analog components would be helpful in understanding what is going on, but is not strictly necessary to just follow along."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"My home theater is far away from my bed and the remote is unreachable there. Many a time, I thought of controlling the home theater from my bed to enjoy music anytime (due to laziness of course). So, I did some search and found this great video from GreatScott. That video provided me enough information to get started. Then further, I taught myself the remaining things to send and receive IR codes from IR receiver and transmitter. After building this you'll be able to control anything that is unreachable from your spot, provided you have enough wires."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"After building my QFH antenna, I became more interested in satellite communications. The QFH antenna works great for circularly polarized signals like weather satellites, but something like a yagi or log-periodic antenna is better for most sats, because it can be pointed directly at the sat. After a short break where I interned at Keysight Technologies then finished my last semester at school, I built a tape measure yagi for 145.8 MHz to receive ISS SSTV broadcasts. It works great for that, but after a few passes I started to wonder if there was a better way. Ideally, some way to track the sat with a computer, automatically. Commercial solutions exist of course, like the Yaesu G-5500. This is a bit expensive for my tastes, and meant for more permanent installations. SatNOGS is a great open-source solution, if you have access to a 3D printer and some parts. I still want to build the SatNOGS rotor, but first I wanted to see if I could build my own version cheaper."</em></p></li>
