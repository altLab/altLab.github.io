<p>Esta semana matemáticos descobriram uma propriedade simples, mas até agora despercebida, dos números primos - os números primos repelem outros possíveis números primos que terminam no mesmo digito e têm propensão para serem seguidos por outros números primos que terminem noutros dígitos finais possíveis.
A ARM e a TSMC anunciaram uma parceria para colaboração do desenvolvimento do processo FinFET de 7nm. Por fim a Honda selecionou o programa Watson IOT da IBM para que possa tomar decisões em tempo real baseados na informação dos cerca de 160 sensores dos seus carros de formula 1.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker e na rubrica "Documentação" apresentamos quatro livros (eBooks) que podem ser descarregados livremente e que esta semana são sobre Conceitos de Computação com Scratch, Administração de Sistemas Redhat Enterprise Linux 7, Introdução à programação e um livro sobre o Microcontrolador STM32.</p>

<p><img src="NS46_MathematiciansDiscoverPrimeCon.jpg" alt="NS46_MathematiciansDiscoverPrimeCon" /></p>

<p><em>"Two mathematicians have uncovered a simple, previously unnoticed property of prime numbers — those numbers that are divisible only by 1 and themselves. Prime numbers, it seems, have decided preferences about the final digits of the primes that immediately follow them. Among the first billion prime numbers, for instance, a prime ending in 9 is almost 65 percent more likely to be followed by a prime ending in 1 than another prime ending in 9. In a paper posted online today, Kannan Soundararajan and Robert Lemke Oliver of Stanford University present both numerical and theoretical evidence that prime numbers repel other would-be primes that end in the same digit, and have varied predilections for being followed by primes ending in the other possible final digits."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="NS46_ArmAndTsmcAnnounceMultiYearAgr.jpg" alt="NS46_ArmAndTsmcAnnounceMultiYearAgr" /></p>

<p><em>"ARM and TSMC announced a multi-year agreement to collaborate on a 7nm FinFET process technology which includes a design solution for future low-power, high-performance compute SoCs. The new agreement expands the companies’ long-standing partnership and advances leading-edge process technologies beyond mobile and into next-generation networks and data centers.

<p><img src="CT46_NanoelectronicsEngineersDevelo.jpg" alt="CT46_NanoelectronicsEngineersDevelo" /></p>

<p><em>"A new atomically-flat transistor developed by UC Santa Barbara engineers overcomes one of the fundamental limitations of conventional transistors and reduces power dissipation by over 90 percent. One of the greatest challenges in the evolution of electronics has been to reduce power consumption during transistor switching operation. In a study recently reported in Nature, engineers at UC Santa Barbara, in collaboration with Rice University, have demonstrated a new transistor that switches at only 0.1 volts and reduces power dissipation by over 90% compared to state-of-the-art silicon transistors (MOSFETs)."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT46_TheWorldsTiniestTemperatureSen.jpg" alt="CT46_TheWorldsTiniestTemperatureSen" /></p>

<p><em>"Researchers at TU/e have developed a very tiny wireless temperature sensor that is powered in a very special way: from the radio waves that are part of the sensor’s wireless network. This means that the sensor needs not even a single wire, nor a battery that would have to be replaced. The arrival of such sensors is an important development on route towards smart buildings, for instance. But the applications are many and various."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT46_NanobombsMightDeliverAgentsTha.jpg" alt="CT46_NanobombsMightDeliverAgentsTha" /></p>

<p><em>"Researchers at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center – Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute (OSUCCC – James) have developed nanoparticles that swell and burst when exposed to near-infrared laser light. Such “nanobombs” might overcome a biological barrier that has blocked development of agents that work by altering the activity – the expression – of genes in cancer cells. The agents might kill cancer cells outright or stall their growth. The kinds of agents that change gene expression are generally forms of RNA (ribonucleic acid), and they are notoriously difficult to use as drugs. First, they are readily degraded when free in the bloodstream. In this study, packaging them in nanoparticles that target tumor cells solved that problem."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT46_CameraSystemSeesRoundCorners.jpg" alt="CT46_CameraSystemSeesRoundCorners" /></p>

<p><em>"Edinburgh researchers have helped develop a camera system that can see around walls. The technology can locate hidden objects with the precision of a few centimetres, and track their movements. The system works by sending light from a laser towards a hidden object or person, which bounces off the object to send a light signal back again."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT46_StanfordLedSkyscraperStyleChip.jpg" alt="CT46_StanfordLedSkyscraperStyleChip" /></p>

<p><em>"In modern computer systems, processor and memory chips are laid out like single-story structures in a suburb. But suburban layouts waste time and energy. A new skyscraper-like design, based on materials more advanced than silicon, provides the next computing platform. For decades, engineers have designed computer systems with processors and memory chips laid out like single-story structures in a suburb. Wires connect these chips like streets, carrying digital traffic between the processors that compute data and the memory chips that store it."</em></p></li>

<p><img src="CT46_TeamProlongsYoungAdultStateInW.jpg" alt="CT46_TeamProlongsYoungAdultStateInW" /></p>

<p><em>"A new study led by scientists at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) shows that an antidepressant drug, called mianserin, can extend the “young adult” state in roundworms, a common model of aging. While it is too soon to know whether the treatment has any effect in humans, the study reveals a new metric to track aging—one that can reveal troubling age-associated changes relatively early in life."</em></p></li>

<p><a href="http://stwww.weizmann.ac.il/g-cs/scratch/scratch-20-supplement-1-0-two-side.pdf">Supplement for Scratch 2.0</a></p>

<p><em>"This book will familiarize you with the Scratch visual programming environment, focusing on using Scratch to learn computer science. The book is structured as a collection of tasks. Each chapter teaches a new concept, but the concept is introduced in order to solve a specific task such as animating dancing images or building a game. Each chapter starts with a simple task, but as soon as we solve one task, we add additional tasks to extend the existing task. The sequence of tasks will require a new construct of Scratch or the use of constructs you know in new ways."</em></p></li>

<p><em>"The System Administrator's Guide documents relevant information regarding the deployment, configuration, and administration of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. It is oriented towards system administrators with a basic understanding of the system. To expand your expertise, you might also be interested in the Red Hat System Administration I (RH124), Red Hat System Administration II (RH134), Red Hat System Administration III (RH254), or RHCSA Rapid Track (RH199) training courses."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://mirrors.fe.up.pt/pub/nongnu//pgubook/ProgrammingGroundUp-1-0-booksize.pdf">Programming from the Ground Up</a></p>

<p><em>"This is an introductory book to programming and computer science using assembly language. It assumes the reader has never programmed before, and introduces the concepts of variables, functions, and flow control. The reason for using assembly language is to get the reader thinking in terms of how the computer actually works underneath. Knowing how the computer works from a "bare-metal" standpoint is often the difference between top-level programmers and programmers who can never quite master their art."</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~geobrown/book.pdf">Discovering the STM32 Microcontroller</a></p>

<p><em>"This book is intended as a hands-on manual for learning how to design systems using the STM32 F1 family of micro-controllers. It was written to support a junior-level computer science course at Indiana University. The focus of this book is on developing code to utilize the various peripherals available in STM32 F1 micro-controllers and in particular the STM32VL Discovery board. Because there are other fine sources of information on the Cortex-M3, which is the core processor for the STM32 F1 micro-controllers, we do not examine this core in detail; an excellent reference is “The Definitive Guide to the ARM CORTEX-M3.”"</em></p></li>

<h1 id="Modelos-3D">Modelos 3D <a href="#topo">^</a></h1>

<p>Com a disponibilidade de ferramentas que permitem dar azo a nossa imaginação na criação de peças 3D e espaços como o <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/">thingiverse</a> para as publicar, esta rubrica apresenta alguns modelos selecionados que poderão ser úteis.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1394225">LED Lamp</a></h2>

<p><img src="MP46_LedLamp.jpg" alt="MP46_LedLamp" /></p>

<p>Print at your own risk. Make sure to check the scale before printing. The shade of the lamp is sized to fit 5mm leds.</p>

<p>Battery Pack
For the base of the battery pack I took a pen and cut off a section. For the caps that go into the battery pack enclosure (pen shaft) I used screw caps(commonly provided with furniture kits to hide the screws) and drilled a hole in the center. I used two of these, one for the top and one for the bottom of the battery pack enclosure.</p>

<p>I removed the springs from the pen and cut it half. Refer to the image you'll see I have one of the springs on the top of the battery pack.</p>

<p>Will explain more later.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1418248">Modular Box</a></h2>

<p><img src="MP46_ModularBox.jpg" alt="MP46_ModularBox" /></p>

<p>Modular Box</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1412606">Test Lead Holder -basic and varied width</a></h2>

<p><img src="MP46_TestLeadHolderBasicAndVariedWi.jpg" alt="MP46_TestLeadHolderBasicAndVariedWi" /></p>

<p>Basic Test lead holder for cables up to 6.35mm (RG-6 with connector). You can fit your meter, generator and power leads on this hanger. Holes for wall mount or if not a lot of weight some two sided tape may work.</p>

<p>Varied Width Test Lead Holder for scope probes, meter and generator leads along with skinny test clips.</p>

<p>There are supports about 2/3 the finger length to handle higher weights for lots of cables. Maybe over built. The varied width hanger is a lighter build.</p>

<p>I have an configurable SCAD file up now to add or take slots away plus other configurable pieces, enjoy.</p>

<p>Let me know what you think.

Stephen Hawkings distinctive voice is from a pre-DEC version of the MIT hardware. DEC is long gone, and the licensing of DECTalk has wandered off into mostly software. Much to the annoyance of those in earshot, Ive always enjoyed dabbling in speech synthesis. DECTalk hardware remains expensive, partly because of demand from electronic music producers (its vocoder-like burr is on countless tracks), but also because there are still many people who rely on it for daily life. I couldnt justify buying a real DECTalk, but I found this: the Parallax Emic 2 Text-to-Speech Module.  For about $80, this stamp-sized board brings a hardware DECTalk implementation to embedded projects. The Emic 2 is really marketed to microcontroller hobbyists: Make Your Arduino Speak! sorta thing.
