<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1698, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Fran%C3%A7ois_de_Cisternay_du_Fay">Charles Du Fay</a>. Este químico Francês, nascido em Paris, ficou conhecido por ter descoberto a existência de dois tipos de electricidade aos quais chamou de "vítreo" e "resinoso" (mais tarde conhecidos como carga positiva e negativa, respectivamente). Ele notou a diferença entre condutores e isoladores, chamando-os de "electricidade" e "não eléctrica" pela sua capacidade de produzir electrificação por contacto. Ele também descobriu que objectos igualmente carregados se repeliam e que objectos muito diferentes se atraíam.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nasciam, em 1847, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Edward_Ayrton">William Edward Ayrton</a> e <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Yablochkov">Pavel Yablochkov</a>. O primeiro era um engenheiro electrotécnico inglês que foi pioneiro na educação técnica. Ele colaborou com John Perry, e suas inúmeras invenções incluem um triciclo eléctrico (1882), o primeiro amperímetro portátil prático, o voltímetro e outros instrumentos para medição eléctrico. O segundo foi um engenheiro electrotécnico russo que ficou conhecido pela invenção de uma lâmpada de arco melhorada, conhecida como a vela de Yablochkov (1876). Sendo barata, foi usada em edifícios públicos e para iluminar ruas durante várias décadas antes do advento da iluminação incandescente, o que exigia muito menos manutenção. Uma luz branca brilhante foi produzida por um arco elétrico entre duas hastes de carbono paralelas, usando corrente alternada para garantir que as hastes se vaporizassem na mesma proporção. As velas de Yablochkov foram usadas a partir de 1877 em Paris e foram instaladas em Londres ao longo de Victoria Embankment (1878), seguido do mercado de peixe Billingsgate, da Mansion House e do Viaducto Holborn.</p>

<p>Na semana que passou a sonda Cassini enviou as ultimas imagens da sua longo viagem que se iniciou no final do século passado à cerca de 20 anos. Depois de 7 anos a viajar até ao planeta Saturno, esteve a orbitar este durante 13 anos. Durante o próximo dia 15 irá entrar na atmosfera de Saturno e despenhar-se-á. Durante o tempo em que esteve em orbita, observou leituras estranhas no pólo sul de <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enceladus">Enceladus</a>, a sexta maior lua de Saturno. Depois de duas passagens adicionais os cientistas verificaram que jatos de vapor de agua eram expelidos vindos debaixo da crosta da lua. Concluindo a existência de um oceano de agua salgada debaixo da crosta de Enceladus. Outra das grandes razões da missão da Cassini era a exploração da lua <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(moon)">Titan</a>, a maior de Saturno e é cerca de 50% maior que a Lua terrestre. Esta lua tem uma atmosfera e é o único objecto no espaço além do planeta Terra onde há evidência clara de corpos estáveis de líquido superficial. Para que o conhecimento sobre esta lua foi ainda mais aprofundado a sonda Cassini transportou uma sonda chamada Huygens, feita pela Agência Espacial Europeia. A sonda aterrou em Titan a 14 de Janeiro de 2005, tornando-se a primeira nave espacial a aterrar no sistema solar exterior. Durante sua descida de 2,5 horas à superfície, Huygens reuniu medições detalhadas da atmosfera de Titan e deu aos cientistas o primeiro olhar de perto sobre a superfície de Titan, revelando leitos de rios secos e lagos na crosta. Na sua viagem foi também possível obter informação detalhada sobre os anéis e a sua composição, assim como a sua origem. Foi igualmente possível observar o famoso hexágono de Saturno - o fluxo de jacto de seis lados no pólo norte do planeta que abrange mais do dobro da largura da Terra. Demorou bastante tempo antes da Cassini poder ver o hexágono com luz visível, já que o fluxo de jactos estava principalmente coberto pela sombra nos primeiros cinco anos da missão. Isso ocorre porque Saturno leva muito mais tempo para orbitar o Sol do que a Terra, então as estações duram muito mais. Mas em 2009, a luz solar finalmente iluminou o hemisfério norte, permitindo a Cassini observar. A sonda finalmente viu o que estava no centro do hexágono: um furacão muito semelhante aos da Terra, mas com um olho cerca de 50 vezes maior do que uma tempestade média. Foi até observado um segundo vórtice parecido com um furacão que se aproximava da borda da corrente de jacto. Os investigadores descobriram depois que a distância do Saturno ao Sol e sua composição atmosférica permitem que os fluxos de jacto se formem em formas geométricas, mas o hexágono ainda é um pouco misterioso: não está claro por que o pólo sul também não possui um hexágono ou o que permite o fluxo de jactos durarem tanto tempo.
Saturno tem mais de 60 luas, algumas das quais foram descobertas pela Cassini. A sonda detectou até seis novas luas no planeta, bem como potenciais pequenas luas que se movem através dos anéis de Saturno, deslocando partículas acima e abaixo das bandas. Fica aqui um link para um <a href="https://youtu.be/W8GhOMrHMkw">Video</a> àcerca dos últimos momentos da sonda.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6944">Cassini Makes its 'Goodbye Kiss' Flyby of Titan</a></h2>

<p>_"NASA's Cassini spacecraft is headed toward its Sept. 15 plunge into Saturn, following a final, distant flyby of the planet's giant moon Titan. The spacecraft made its closest approach to Titan today at 12:04 p.m. PDT (3:04 p.m. EDT), at an altitude of 73,974 miles (119,049 kilometers) above the moon's surface. The spacecraft is scheduled to make contact with Earth on Sept. 12 at about 6:19 p.m. PDT (9:19 p.m. EDT). Images and other science data taken during the encounter are expected to begin streaming to Earth soon after. Navigators will analyze the spacecraft's trajectory following this downlink to confirm that Cassini is precisely on course to dive into Saturn at the planned time, location and altitude. This distant encounter is referred to informally as "the goodbye kiss" by mission engineers, because it provides a gravitational nudge that sends the spacecraft toward its dramatic ending in Saturn's upper atmosphere. <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6944">[...]</a>

<p>_"China is building the world’s largest quantum research facility to develop a quantum computer and other “revolutionary” forms of technology that can be used by the military for code-breaking or on stealth submarines, according to scientists and authorities involved in the project. The National Laboratory for Quantum Information Science will be located on a 37-hectare site next to a small lake in Hefei, Anhui province. Some time this month developers will be invited to bid for a contract to construct the site, according to an article in Hefei Evening News, a daily newspaper run by the city government on Thursday. Pan Jianwei, China’s lead quantum scientist who was playing a key role in the project, told local officials at a briefing in May that technology developed in the facility would be of immediate use to the armed forces, according to Anhui Business Daily newspaper. Quantum metrology, which measures small variations in physical parameters such as gravity with unprecedented accuracy, could significantly improve submarines’ stealth operations. A submarine with a quantum navigation system could operate underwater for more than three months without the need to surface for positioning satellite signals. <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2110563/china-building-worlds-biggest-quantum-research-facility">[...]</a>

<p>_"Chinese scientists claim they have developed a working model of a microwave engine, which defies the laws of conventional physics, CCTV-2 reported. The TV channel provided no details of the EmDrive microwave engine, saying only that it would soon be tested in space. The EmDrive is built around a microwave-generating magnetron and a resonator, which accumulates the energy of their fluctuations. This generates thrust, which can’t be explained by the conventional energy conservation law. The magnetron pushes microwaves into a closed truncated cone, driving them against its short end thus propelling the craft forward without producing any exhaust. This differs from the type of propulsion currently used by spacecraft, which burn large quantities of fuel to generate a massive amount of energy to rocket the craft into space. <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201709121057317007-china-engine-space/">[...]</a>

Omeed Momeni, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at UC Davis, and doctoral student Hossein Jalili designed the chip using a phased array antenna system. Phased array systems funnel the energy from multiple sources into a single beam that can be narrowly steered and directed to a specific location. “Phased arrays are pretty difficult to create, especially at higher frequencies,” Momeni said. “We are the first to achieve this much bandwidth at this frequency.” The chip prototyped by Momeni and Jalili successfully operates at 370 GHz with 52 GHz of bandwidth. For comparison, FM radio waves broadcast between 87.5 and 108 MHz; 4G and LTE cellular networks generally function between 800 MHz and 2.6 GHz with up to 20 MHz of bandwidth. <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/high-frequency-chip-brings-researchers-closer-next-generation-technology/">[...]</a>

In spite of many new technologies that have been developed in the meantime, the controlled magnetization of a data storage medium remains the first choice for archiving information because of its longevity and low price. As a means of realizing random access memories (RAMs), however, which are used as the main memory for processing data in computers, magnetic storage technologies were long considered inadequate.

<p>_"Artificial-intelligence research has been transformed by machine-learning systems called neural networks, which learn how to perform tasks by analyzing huge volumes of training data. During training, a neural net continually readjusts thousands of internal parameters until it can reliably perform some task, such as identifying objects in digital images or translating text from one language to another. But on their own, the final values of those parameters say very little about how the neural net does what it does. Understanding what neural networks are doing can help researchers improve their performance and transfer their insights to other applications, and computer scientists have recently developed some clever techniques for divining the computations of particular neural networks. But, at the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods on Natural Language Processing starting this week, researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory are presenting a new general-purpose technique for making sense of neural networks that are trained to perform natural-language-processing tasks, in which computers attempt to interpret freeform texts written in ordinary, or “natural,” language (as opposed to a structured language, such as a database-query language). The technique applies to any system that takes text as input and produces strings of symbols as output, such as an automatic translator. <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/how-neural-networks-think-0908">[...]</a>

SpeCam is a program which would enable existing phones to utilize their camera function to recognise different materials they have been exposed to. This would link up with a previously created database so the phone could “understand” what type of surface it has been placed on. This offers a wide range of applications from allowing your phone to tell you where it is when you can’t find it, to programming it to take different surfaces as a trigger for action. For example if the phone rings and you place it face down on your laptop, it could send a message saying “sorry I am in a meeting” or if put inside your pocket it could suggest the caller try a different colleague. The program would also allow the way the phone is held to perform tasks, such as changing the volume on the television, or playing certain music, such as soft jazz if placed on the sofa or dance music if on the coffee table. <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/news/archive/2017/title,1550872,en.php">[...]</a>

<p>_"A group of researchers at the University of Tokyo and their collaborators have figured out how ladybugs fold their wings by transplanting a transparent artificial wing onto the insect and observing its underlying folding mechanism. The study's findings, which help explain how the wings can maintain their strength and rigidity during flight, while becoming elastic for compact folding and storage on the ground, provide hints for the innovative design of a wide range of deployable structures, from satellite antennas to microscopic medical instruments to articles for daily use like umbrellas and fans. Ladybugs are highly mobile insects that can switch between walking and flying with ease and speed because they can quickly deploy and collapse their wings. Their wings consist of the hardened elytra, the forewings with the familiar spots, and the soft-membrane hindwings used for flight, which are covered and protected by the elytra. Previous studies have suggested that up-and-down movements in the abdomen and complex origami-like crease patterns on the wings play important roles in the folding process, but how the simple motion produces such an intricate folded shape remained a mystery. Ladybugs close their elytra before wing folding, preventing observation of the detailed process, and as the elytra are essential elements for folding, they also cannot be removed to reveal what lies underneath. <a href="http://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/utokyo-research/research-news/unfolding-the-folding-mechanism-of-ladybug-wings.html">[...]</a>

<p>_"Smallest-yet optical quantum memory device is a storage medium for optical quantum networks with the potential to be scaled up for commercial use For the first time, an international team led by engineers at Caltech has developed a computer chip with nanoscale optical quantum memory. Quantum memory stores information in a similar fashion to the way traditional computer memory does, but on individual quantum particles—in this case, photons of light. This allows it to take advantage of the peculiar features of quantum mechanics (such as superposition, in which a quantum element can exist in two distinct states simultaneously) to store data more efficiently and securely. "Such a device is an essential component for the future development of optical quantum networks that could be used to transmit quantum information," says Andrei Faraon (BS '04), assistant professor of applied physics and materials science in the Division of Engineering and Applied Science at Caltech, and the corresponding author of a paper describing the new chip. The study appeared online ahead of publication by Science magazine on August 31. "This technology not only leads to extreme miniaturization of quantum memory devices, it also enables better control of the interactions between individual photons and atoms," says Tian Zhong, lead author of the study and a Caltech postdoctoral scholar. <a href="http://www.caltech.edu/news/first-chip-nanoscale-optical-quantum-memory-developed-79591">[...]</a>

<p>_"A new device being developed by Washington State University physicist Yi Gu could one day turn the heat generated by a wide array of electronics into a usable fuel source. The device is a multicomponent, multilayered composite material called a van der Waals Schottky diode. It converts heat into electricity up to three times more efficiently than silicon — a semiconductor material widely used in the electronics industry. While still in an early stage of development, the new diode could eventually provide an extra source of power for everything from smartphones to automobiles. “The ability of our diode to convert heat into electricity is very large compared to other bulk materials currently used in electronics,” said Gu, an associate professor in WSU’s Department of Physics and Astronomy. “In the future, one layer could be attached to something hot like a car exhaust or a computer motor and another to a surface at room temperature. <a href="https://news.wsu.edu/2017/08/30/heat-to-energy-fuel-source/">[...]</a>

<p>_"Experiments with bacteria show that genes can fuse together, leading to the production of novel proteins All organisms must continuously adapt to their environment in order to survive. Such adaptation is brought about by changes in their genetic material. Together with colleagues from New Zealand, Paul Rainey from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Plön has been studying the emergence of new, better adapted cell types in the laboratory. The researchers have discovered that one mechanism by which bacteria can develop new characteristics is through the fusion of two existing genes. In some of the cells, this resulted in genes coming under the control of a new promoter, resulting in the synthesis of larger quantities of the protein encoded by the gene. In another case, two neighbouring genes fused together. <a href="https://www.mpg.de/11468338/gene-fusion">[...]</a>

<p>_"Conventional electron accelerators have become an indispensable tool in modern research. The extremely bright radiation generated by synchrotrons, or free electron lasers, provides us with unique insights into matter at the atomic level. But even the smallest versions of these super microscopes are the size of a soccer field. Laser plasma acceleration could offer an alternative: with a much smaller footprint and much higher peak currents it could be the basis for the next generation of compact light sources. So far, the challenge with laser accelerators has been to create a reliable and stable electron beam, which is the prerequisite for possible applications. Physicists at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR) have now developed a method to increase both beam stability and quality The basic principle of laser acceleration seems quite simple: A bundled, ultra-strong laser beam hits a trace of gas, which instantly creates plasma – an ionized state of matter or, in other words, a whirling mix of charged particles. <a href="https://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pOid=54064">[...]</a>

<p>_"Game studios and enthusiasts may soon have a new tool at their disposal to speed up game development and experiment with different styles of play. Georgia Institute of Technology researchers have developed a new approach using an artificial intelligence to learn a complete game engine, the basic software of a game that governs everything from character movement to rendering graphics. Their AI system watches less than two minutes of gameplay video and then builds its own model of how the game operates by studying the frames and making predictions of future events, such as what path a character will choose or how enemies might react. To get their AI agent to create an accurate predictive model that could account for all the physics of a 2D platform-style game, the team trained the AI on a single “speedrunner” video, where a player heads straight for the goal. This made “the training problem for the AI as difficult as possible.” Their current work uses Super Mario Bros. and they’ve started replicating the experiments with Mega Man and Sonic the Hedgehog as well. The same team first used AI and Mario Bros. gameplay video to create unique game level designs. <a href="https://gvu.gatech.edu/ai-uses-less-two-minutes-videogame-footage-recreate-game-engine">[...]</a>

<p>_"Storms like Hurricane Irma and other natural disasters bring with them lots of uncertainty: where will they go, how much damage will they cause. What is certain is that no matter where they strike, natural disasters knock out power. And, no power means no internet for thousands of people in affected areas. However, researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology are proposing a new way of gathering and sharing information during natural disasters that does not rely on the internet. Using computing power built into mobile phones, routers, and other hardware to create a network, emergency managers and first responders will be able to share and act on information gathered from people impacted by hurricanes, tornados, floods, and other disasters. “Increasingly, data gathered from passive and active sensors that people carry with them, such as their mobile phones, is being used to inform situational awareness in a variety of settings,” said Kishore Ramachandran, computer science professor at Georgia Tech. <a href="http://www.news.gatech.edu/2017/09/08/new-research-may-improve-communications-during-natural-disasters">[...]</a>

<p>_"Researchers at Caltech have developed a prototype miniature medical device that could ultimately be used in "smart pills" to diagnose and treat diseases. A key to the new technology—and what makes it unique among other microscale medical devices—is that its location can be precisely identified within the body, something that proved challenging before. "The dream is that we will have microscale devices that are roaming our bodies and either diagnosing problems or fixing things," says Azita Emami, the Andrew and Peggy Cherng Professor of Electrical Engineering and Medical Engineering and Heritage Medical Research Institute Investigator, who co-led the research along with Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering and Heritage Medical Research Institute Investigator Mikhail Shapiro. "Before now, one of the challenges was that it was hard to tell where they are in the body." A paper describing the new device appears in the September issue of the journal Nature Biomedical Engineering. The lead author is Manuel Monge (MS '10, PhD '17), who was a doctoral student in Emami's lab and a Rosen Bioengineering Center Scholar at Caltech, and now works at a company called Neuralink. <a href="http://www.caltech.edu/news/medicine-future-new-microchip-technology-could-be-used-track-smart-pills-79601">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.csail.mit.edu/printable_structures_fold_themselves">“Peel-and-go” Printable Structures Fold Themselves</a></h2>

<p>_"As 3-D printing has become a mainstream technology, industry and academic researchers have been investigating printable structures that will fold themselves into useful three-dimensional shapes when heated or immersed in water. In a paper appearing in the American Chemical Society’s journal Applied Materials and Interfaces, researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and colleagues report something new: a printable structure that begins to fold itself up as soon as it’s peeled off the printing platform. One of the big advantages of devices that self-fold without any outside stimulus, the researchers say, is that they can involve a wider range of materials and more delicate structures. “If you want to add printed electronics, you’re generally going to be using some organic materials, because a majority of printed electronics rely on them,” says Subramanian Sundaram, an MIT graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science and first author on the paper. “These materials are often very, very sensitive to moisture and temperature. So if you have these electronics and parts, and you want to initiate folds in them, you wouldn’t want to dunk them in water or heat them, because then your electronics are going to degrade.” To illustrate this idea, the researchers built a prototype self-folding printable device that includes electrical leads and a polymer “pixel” that changes from transparent to opaque when a voltage is applied to it. <a href="http://www.csail.mit.edu/printable_structures_fold_themselves">[...]</a>

Ideally, with the airflow to all rooms balanced, every room would reach the temperature set on the thermostat, but this can't work at all times of the day. In summer, the sun's varying angle in the sky means that the east side of the house is heated more in the morning, the south walls receive most at midday, then the west walls in the late afternoon.

This is useful because it provides longer battery life, reduce carbon emission ( think about billions of microcontrollers ) and save cost. But there is a problem, when you built a project using a development board rather than just using the bare microcontroller, sleep is not going to save power. Most development boards have a power LED which is always on, there are debugging circuits and sensors on board which consumes power even though the primary mcu is sleeping.

Chip AmpsIt used to be that audio amplification depended on large numbers of discrete components or power-hungry vacuum tubes to get decent sound from a source to a speaker.

While some bats do make audible clicks, most produce inaudible clicks that are between 20kHz and 200kHz. Since vision is severely restricted at night and in caves, bats rely on echolocation, which works in a nearly identical fashion to submarine SONAR. Essentially, the bat generates a high-frequency click that bounces off surrounding objects. The reflected click is detected by the bat and this is enough information for the bat to determine the size and type of object nearby, as well as the distance from it. Luckily for us, these sound waves diffract and spread in mostly all directions—so if we can create a circuit that can detect these clicks then we should be able to track bats! <a href="https://diyhacking.com/how-to-build-your-own-bat-detector/">[...]</a>
