<p>Faz hoje anos <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Watt">James Watt</a>. Este inventor escocês nascido em 1736, foi responsável pela invenção do motor a vapor, fundamental para a Revolução industrial. Tendo desenvolvido o conceito de cavalo de força (horsepower) foi atribuido à unidade de força (Power) o seu nome.
Esta semana ficámos a saber que foi lançado o módulo de computação Raspberrry Pi 3 - este tem um formato identico ao anterior no entanto já usa o mesmo microcontrolador do Raspberry Pi 3 tradicional, sendo por isso 10 vezes mais rápido que o anterior módulo. Os satélites Galileo estão a sofrer falhas multiplas dos seus relógios internos. Dos 18 satélites em órbita, 9 têm os relógios avariados. Esta situação, cuja origem do problema ainda não é conhecida irá certamente atrasar ainda mais o funcionamento em pleno desta rede alternativa ao GPS. O CEO da Airbus afirmou numa conferencia esta semana que o seu grupo irá fazer os primeiros testes de voo com um veiculo - vulgo carro voador - ainda este ano. O veiculo é bastante similar a um helicoptero.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como alguns modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis. Falamos ainda sobre as revistas PROGRAMAR - edição 54 e a newelectronics de 10 de Janeiro 2017.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/compute-module-3/">Compute module 3 out now!</a></h2>

<p><em>"The Raspberry Pi Foundation has launched a new version of its Compute Module – a Raspberry Pi in a more flexible form factor, intended to provide an easy and cost-effective route to producing customised products. While the original Module, launched in 2014, contained the guts of a first-generation Pi, the new Compute Module 3 (CM3) is based on the Pi 3, so offers a major boost in performance. “It’s got the same BCM2837 processor which can run at up to 1.2HGz and 1GB of RAM,” says Foundation COO James Adams. This means it provides twice the RAM and roughly ten times the CPU performance of the original Compute Module (CM1). Just like the Pi 3, the CM3 is able to run Windows 10 IoT Core, opening up many possibilities: “An IoT project can be ported from a Pi 3 onto a custom CM3-based system very easily.”"</em> <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/compute-module-3/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Across the 18 satellites now in orbit, nine clocks have stopped operating. Three are traditional rubidium devices; six are the more precise hydrogen maser instruments that were designed to give Galileo superior performance to the American GPS network. Galileo was declared up and running in December. However, it is still short of the number of satellites considered to represent a fully functioning constellation, and a decision must now be made about whether to suspend the launch of further spacecraft while the issue is investigated. Prof Jan Woerner, the director general of the European Space Agency (Esa), told a meeting with reporters: "Everybody is raising this question: should we postpone the next launch until we find the root cause, or should we launch?"</em> <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-38664225">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Three-dimensional printing technology makes it possible to rapidly manufacture objects by depositing layer upon layer of polymers in a precisely determined pattern. Once these objects are completed, the polymers that form the material are “dead” — that is, they cannot be extended to form new polymer chains. MIT chemists have now developed a technique that allows them to print objects and then go back and add new polymers that alter the materials’ chemical composition and mechanical properties. The researchers can also fuse two or more printed objects together to form more complex structures."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/technique-enables-adaptable-3-d-printing-0113">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Engineered nanometer- and micrometer-scale structures have a vast array of uses in electronics, sensors and biomedical applications. Because these are difficult to fabricate, KAUST researchers are trying a bottom-up philosophy, which harnesses the natural forces between atoms and molecules such that microstructures form themselves. This approach, a departure from the usual top-down approach, involves the etching away of material to leave the desired sculpted structure behind; however, because this approach can be tricky, expensive and time consuming, KAUST researchers became motivated to find a new approach."</em> <a href="https://discovery.kaust.edu.sa/en/article/307/the-power-of-attraction">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Researchers have demonstrated the high-performance potential of an experimental transistor made of a semiconductor called beta gallium oxide, which could bring new ultra-efficient switches for applications such as the power grid, military ships and aircraft. The semiconductor is promising for next-generation “power electronics,” or devices needed to control the flow of electrical energy in circuits. Such a technology could help to reduce global energy use and greenhouse gas emissions by replacing less efficient and bulky power electronics switches now in use. The transistor, called a gallium oxide on insulator field effect transistor, or GOOI, is especially promising because it possesses an “ultra-wide bandgap,” a trait needed for switches in high-voltage applications. Compared to other semiconductors thought to be promising for the transistors, devices made from beta gallium oxide have a higher “breakdown voltage,” or the voltage at which the device fails, said Peide Ye, Purdue University's Richard J. and Mary Jo Schwartz Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering."</em> <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2017/Q1/semiconductor-eyed-for-next-generation-power-electronics.html">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"A revolutionary and emerging class of energy-harvesting computer systems require neither a battery nor a power outlet to operate, instead operating by harvesting energy from their environment. While radio waves, solar energy, heat, and vibrations have the ability to power devices, harvested energy sources are weak leading to an “intermittent execution,” with periodic power failures and unreliable behavior. Brandon Lucia, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, and his Ph.D. student Alexei Colin created the first programming language designed to build reliable software for intermittent, energy-harvesting computers. Colin will present the work at the 2016 SPLASH conference in Amsterdam, Netherlands, on November 3rd."</em> <a href="http://www.ece.cmu.edu/news/story/2016/10/making-energy-harvesting-computers-reliable.html">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/graphenes-sleeping-superconductivity-awakens">Graphene’s sleeping superconductivity awakens</a></h2>

<p><em>"Researchers have found a way to trigger the innate, but previously hidden, ability of graphene to act as a superconductor – meaning that it can be made to carry an electrical current with zero resistance. The finding, reported in Nature Communications, further enhances the potential of graphene, which is already widely seen as a material that could revolutionise industries such as healthcare and electronics. Graphene is a two-dimensional sheet of carbon atoms and combines several remarkable properties; for example, it is very strong, but also light and flexible, and highly conductive. Since its discovery in 2004, scientists have speculated that graphene may also have the capacity to be a superconductor. Until now, superconductivity in graphene has only been achieved by doping it with, or by placing it on, a superconducting material - a process which can compromise some of its other properties. But in the new study, researchers at the University of Cambridge managed to activate the dormant potential for graphene to superconduct in its own right. This was achieved by coupling it with a material called praseodymium cerium copper oxide (PCCO)."</em> <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/graphenes-sleeping-superconductivity-awakens">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="http://sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2017/01/14/seeing-the-quantum-future.html">Seeing the quantum future… literally</a></h2>

<p><em>"Scientists at the University of Sydney have demonstrated the ability to “see” the future of quantum systems, and used that knowledge to preempt their demise, in a major achievement that could help bring the strange and powerful world of quantum technology closer to reality. The applications of quantum-enabled technologies are compelling and already demonstrating significant impacts – especially in the realm of sensing and metrology.   And the potential to build exceptionally powerful quantum computers using quantum bits, or qubits, is driving investment from the world’s largest companies. However a significant obstacle to building reliable quantum technologies has been the randomisation of quantum systems by their environments, or decoherence, which effectively destroys the useful quantum character. The physicists have taken a technical quantum leap in addressing this, using techniques from big data to predict how quantum systems will change and then preventing the system’s breakdown from occurring."</em> <a href="http://sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2017/01/14/seeing-the-quantum-future.html">[...]</a></p>

Often, a comprehensive update that addresses teething troubles is already offered when a new programme is launched. This creates manifold problems, and public entities as well as businesses are often exposed to attacks by hackers. Software is used in a growing number of sensitive areas where a computer failure might even be life threatening.

<p><em>"A team of researchers led by Biomedical Engineering Professor Sam Sia at Columbia Engineering has developed a way to manufacture microscale machines from biomaterials that can safely be implanted in the body. Working with hydrogels, which are biocompatible materials that engineers have been studying for decades, Sia has invented a new technique that stacks the soft material in layers to make devices that have three-dimensional, freely moving parts. The study, published online January 4, 2017, in Science Robotics, demonstrates a fast manufacturing method Sia calls “implantable microelectromechanical systems” (iMEMS). By exploiting the unique mechanical properties of hydrogels, the researchers developed a “locking mechanism” for precise actuation and movement of freely moving parts, which can function as valves, manifolds, rotors, pumps, and drug delivery systems. They were able to tune the biomaterials within a wide range of mechanical and diffusive properties and to control them after implantation without a sustained power supply, such as a toxic battery. They then tested the payload delivery in a bone cancer model and found that the triggering of releases of doxorubicin from the device over 10 days showed high treatment efficacy and low toxicity, at 1/10th of the standard systemic chemotherapy dose."</em> <a href="http://engineering.columbia.edu/news/sam-sia-implantable-micrororobots">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Here’s how to build a whirligig: Thread a loop of twine through two holes in a button. Grab the loop ends, then rhythmically pull. As the twine coils and uncoils, the button spins at a dizzying speed. Now, using the same mechanical principles, Stanford bioengineers have created an ultra-low-cost, human-powered centrifuge that separates blood into its individual components in only 1.5 minutes. Built from 20 cents of paper, twine and plastic, a “paperfuge” can spin at speeds of 125,000 rpm and exert centrifugal forces of 30,000 Gs. “To the best of my knowledge, it’s the fastest spinning object driven by human power,” said Manu Prakash, an assistant professor of bioengineering at Stanford. A centrifuge is critical for detecting diseases such as malaria, African sleeping sickness, HIV and tuberculosis. This low-cost version will enable precise diagnosis and treatment in the poor, off-the-grid regions where these diseases are most prevalent. The physics and test results of this device are published in the Jan. 10 issue of Nature Biomedical Engineering."</em> <a href="http://news.stanford.edu/2017/01/10/whirligig-toy-bioengineers-develop-20-cent-hand-powered-blood-centrifuge/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"The A1230 is a dual-channel, bipolar switch with two Hall-effect sensing elements, each providing a separate digital output for speed and direction signal processing capability. The Hall elements are photo lithographically aligned to better than 1 µm. maintaining accurate mechanical location between the two active Hall elements eliminates the major manufacturing hurdle encountered in fine-pitch detection applications. The A1230 is a highly sensitive, temperature stable magnetic sensing device ideal for use in ring magnet based, speed and direction systems located in harsh automotive and industrial environments. The A1230 monolithic integrated circuit (IC) contains two independent Hall-effect bipolar switches located 1 mm apart. The digital outputs are out of phase so that the outputs are in quadrature when interfaced with the proper ring magnet design. This allows easy processing of speed and direction signals. Extremely low-drift amplifiers guarantee symmetry between the switches to maintain signal quadrature. The Allegro patented, high-frequency chopper-stabilization technique cancels offsets in each channel providing stable operation over the full specified temperature and voltage ranges. Additionally, the high-frequency chopping circuits allow an increased analog signal-to-noise ratio at the input of the digital comparators internal to the IC. As a result, the A1230 achieves industry-leading digital output jitter performance that is critical in high performance motor commutation applications. An on-chip low dropout (LDO) regulator allows the use of this device over a wide operating voltage range. Post-assembly factory programming at Allegro provides sensitive switch points that are symmetrical between the two switches."</em> <a href="http://www.electronics-lab.com/project/dual-channel-quadrature-hall-effect-bipolar-switch-module-magnetic-encoder/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"I constructed a geodesic dome consisting of 120 triangles with an LED and sensor at each triangle. Each LED can be addressed individually and each sensor is tuned specifically for a single triangle. The dome is programmed with an Arduino to light up and produce a MIDI signal depending on which triangle you place your hand. I designed the dome to be a fun display that gets people interested in light, electronics, and sound. Because the dome divides nicely into five parts, I designed the dome to have five separate MIDI outputs that can each have a different sound. This makes the dome a giant musical instrument, ideal for playing music with multiple people simultaneously. In addition to playing music, I also programmed the dome for light shows and playing a rendition of Simon and Pong. The final structure is a little more than a meter in diameter and 70cm tall, and is primarily constructed with wood, acrylic, and 3D printed parts. There are several great Instructables on LED tables and cubes that inspired me to start this project. However, I wanted to try arranging the LEDs in a different geometry.

<p><em>"Starting playing with Arduino seems simple enough. You can find all sorts of tutorials, instructables, wiring and code examples for pretty much every sensor, component, or module available. So far so good. But when the time comes for building a more complex device, the troubles start. The tutorials for adding multiple modules to Arduino and then working with them efficiently are very scarce. Therefore, with this instructable, I will try to help with just that. So here comes the Arduino thermometer/hygrometer with a GUI, designed to push Arduino to its limits. A small confession is in order though. When I started this project, I thought that the limit to it were the number of Arduino GPIOs, which limit the number of modules one can attach to it. I was considering multiple sensors, more than one display, several buttons and other input modules. However, as I later discovered, the real bottleneck proved to be the limited memory (firstly RAM, but Flash comes a close second). So I shrunk down the project quite a lot, but I ended up with a nice (and hopefully someone will share this sentiment with me) and quite feature rich thermometer. The whole journey made me think that the experience should be shared with the community, since Instructables helped me a lot with my first steps in Arduino. The project is based on an OLED display, a small pot-based joystick, and temperature and humidity sensor (thermometer/hygrometer). It is designed to connect to an external thermometer/hygrometer over the built-in UART. Analog and digital inputs, and digital outputs are used, eeprom, timers, and interrupts.

All the ground cables are soldered to the ground rail and the positive (red) wires are mounted to the output pins. I ended up wiring the motors to pins 2-13 and used pins A0-A2 as output pins for a total of 15. By avoiding pins 0 and 1, I'm able to program the Metro Mini without conflict. While I'm in the early programming stage, there are sequences that vibrate one side of the scalp then the other. Another sequence revolves around the scalp. And yet another vibrates the symmetrical points on either side of the scalp. I'm still experimenting with different sequences. Version 2 is already underway using 21 motors and this time using an Adafruit Bluetooth Feather processor, so I can develop a smartphone interface."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/dheld/programmable-scalp-massager-7b43c7">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"There are plenty of maker projects out there that show you how to connect a generic PIR motion sensor to a microcontroller. For those interested in learning about PIR motion sensors, then Adafruit's How PIRs Work tutorial is worth a read. This proof of concept project (POC) takes it one step further, by demonstrating a convenient method of using your smartphone to get the microcontroller to either ignore a PIR event trigger, i.e. when the sensor is set as disarmed, or get the microcontroller to respond with some form of output or automated action (in this case send a user notification via the Internet and trigger a buzzer), when the motion sensor is seen as armed. The aim of this project, was to only allow smartphone user control when the user was in the vicinity of the PIR sensor. As such, the system is built around a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) module, as the actual wireless signal transmission range of the BLE module can then be used to limit how far way the user can be and still control the system via their smartphone. The brains behind the whole system is handled in the cloud and as such requires Internet connectivity using a wifi network. The control system developed also includes a simple user classification, between a family member (which has full control 24/7) and a friend (which only has control during certain periods of the day etc.). For the purposes of this POC, a "friend" user gets arm/disarm control from 9am till 9pm."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/gerrikoiot/family-friend-or-foe-pir-arm-disarm-using-ble-e561e8">[...]</a></p>

The dolly is essentially a moving robot with the ability to move the camera position as well. Photographers can program the dolly with certain motions and place it on a landscape. After setting the time-lapse mode on, the camera dolly will move accordingly and take the timelapse until the photographer determines the shot to be sufficient. Our camera dolly can be controlled using an iPhone application that we created. There are two modes: free mode, where the photographer can manually control the dolly or camera angle, and programmed mode, where the photographer can program many different actions (such as moving forward, moving the camera, etc.) over a time period so the time lapse can be complete."</em> <a href="http://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/FinalProjects/f2016/ssh88_jcz28_ooo25/ssh88_jcz28_ooo25/ssh88_jcz28_ooo25/index.html">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/dekuNukem/fap80">FAP80, A retro computer without the retro baggage</a></h2>

<p><em>"FAP80 is a Z80-based retro computer with a sprinkling of modern twists to make the experience of designing, programming, and debugging this computer as painless and straightforward as possible. A lot of retro computer projects today are rooted on nostalgia, they tend to use “period correct” components to get the “feelings” right, and the result often ends up on perfboard or self-etched circuit boards, rudimentary video capacity if at all, few I/O ports, and a symphony of 74 series chips. While there is nothing wrong with that, I wasn’t around during the 80s home computer era, so I didn’t have the same attachment to how things was done back then. So instead of trying to recreate the “good old days”, I made the decision to liberally use modern parts to simplify the design process, as well as making this computer highly flexible and easy to program and use with very little overheads. The project started life hand-assembled, but now lives properly on PCBs because of noise problems. See my blog for detailed write-ups about this project."</em> <a href="https://github.com/dekuNukem/fap80">[...]</a></p>
