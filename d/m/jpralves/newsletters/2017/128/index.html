<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1812, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascanio_Sobrero">Ascanio Sobrero</a>. Este químico italiano ficou conhecido por ter descoberto o composto explosivo nitroglicerina. Esta era formada ao adicionar lentamente a glicerina à mistura de ácidos nítrico e sulfúrico. Quando descobriu o poder explosivo mesmo de uma única gota num tubo de ensaio, ele nomeou o novo composto de piro-glicerina. Sobrero ficou horrorizado com o potencial destrutivo da sua descoberta, e não fez nenhum esforço para desenvolver esse poder ele mesmo, embora tenha ficado conhecida como nitroglicerina ou óleo explosivo.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1860, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmer_Ambrose_Sperry">Elmer Ambrose Sperry</a>. Foi um engenheiro e inventor americano que inventou a bússola giroscópica. Na década de 1890, ele criou invenções úteis em máquinas eléctricas de mineração assim como o sistema de travão eléctrico para veículos. Em 1908, ele patenteou o giroscópio activo impedia que um navio se virasse assim que começasse. Ele patenteou a primeira bússola giroscópica projectada expressamente para o meio marinho em 1910. Este giro de "roda giratória" foi uma grande melhoria em relação ao compasso magnético tradicional e mudou o curso da história naval. O primeiro giroscópio Sperry foi testado no mar a bordo do USS Delaware em 1911 e estabeleceu a Sperry como líder mundial na fabricação de giroscópios militares nos 80 anos seguintes.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1931, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ole-Johan_Dahl">Ole-Johan Dahl</a>. Este cientista da computação norueguês ficou conhecido por ser um dos pais da linguagem Simula e da programação orientada a objectos conjuntamente com Kristen Nygaard. Eles foram os primeiros a desenvolver os conceitos de classe, subclasse (permitindo ocultação de informações implícitas), herança, criação dinâmica de objectos, etc., todos os aspectos importantes do paradigma OO. Um objecto é um componente autónomo (com uma estrutura de dados e procedimentos ou métodos associados) num sistema de software. Estes são combinados para formar um sistema completo. A abordagem orientada a objectos é agora abrangente no desenvolvimento de software moderno, incluindo linguagens de programação imperativas amplamente utilizadas, como Java e C++.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1952, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Heath-Brown">Roger Heath-Brown</a>. Este Matemático inglês trabalhou no campo da teoria analítica dos números. Heath-Brown é conhecido por muitos resultados impressionantes. Ele provou que existem infinitamente muitos números primos da forma x^3 + 2y^3.
Ficou também conhecido pela sua contribuição da chamada constante de Heath-Brown–Moroz, com o seu nome e do matemático Boris Moroz. Esta constante faz parte de uma estimativa assimptótica para a distribuição de pontos racionais de altura limitada na superfície cúbica X0^3 = X1X2X3.</p>

<p>Na semana que passou ficámos a saber que a Alphabet vai usar o seu sistema de balões - Project Loon - para tentar restabelecer as telecomunicações em Porto Rico que ficaram bastante danificadas depois da passagem dos furacões Irma e Maria. Os balões forneceriam serviços de voz e dados através de operadoras locais para telefones dos utilizadores. Na sua aplicação à FCC, a empresa incluiu cartas e e-mails de oito operadoras sem fio de Porto Rico, no qual eles consentiram que o Loon usasse as suas frequências para aliviar a situação de desastre e restaurar comunicações ainda que limitadas.</p>

<p>Também esta semana que passou a SpaceX lançou com sucesso mais 10 novos satélites da rede Iridium. Os satélites Iridium Next foram largados 57 minutos após o lançamento, com todo o processo a levar cerca de 15 minutos, de acordo com o plano de voo da SpaceX.</p>

<p>Ainda esta semana, na conferencia GTC Europe, a NVIDIA anunciou que a Deutsche Post DHL Group (DPDHL), a maior empresa de correio e logística do mundo, e a ZF, um dos maiores fornecedores de automóveis do mundo, se juntaram para implantar uma frota de testes de camiões de entrega autónoma, começando já em 2018. A DPDHL projecta camiões eléctricos com o sistema de auto-condução ZF ProAI, baseado na tecnologia NVIDIA DRIVE ™ PX, para automatizar o transporte e entrega de pacotes, incluindo a "última milha" de entregas.</p>

<p>Também esta semana a Intel anunciou um nome chip para a computação quântica dotado de uma capacidade de 17-qubits. O novo chip foi fabricado pela Intel e possui um design exclusivo para obter melhor desempenho. A disponibilização deste chip demonstra o progresso rápido que a Intel e a QuTech estão a fazer na pesquisa e desenvolvimento de um sistema de computação quântica funcional. Ele também demonstra a importância da ciência dos materiais e da fabricação de semicondutores na realização da promessa da computação quântica. A computação quântica, em essência, é o melhor em computação paralela, com o potencial de resolver problemas que os computadores convencionais não conseguem manipular.</p>

<p>Por fim, o asteriode 2012 TC4, observado pela primeira vez à 5 anos atrás pela Telescópio Pan-STARRS no Observatório de Haleakala, no Havai vai passar muito perto da Terra hoje dia 12. O asteróide do tamanho de uma casa será observado cuidadosamente por astrofísicos e possibilitará às agências espaciais uma rara oportunidade de testar as defesas espaciais do planeta assim como pensar no que fariam se um asteróide maior e mais ameaçador fosse detectado em direcção directa à Terra.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como vários modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis. É apresentada a revista newelectronics de 10 de Outubro assim como o livro Geração de Som 8-bits com o Arduino e o livro Reading in Database Systems.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-closer-to-using-balloons-for-telecom-in-puerto-rico/">Alphabet Closer To Using Balloons For Telecom In Puerto Rico</a></h2>

<p><em>"LAST FRIDAY, ENGINEERS on Google parent Alphabet’s internet-by-balloon Project Loon tweeted that they hoped to bring emergency connectivity to Puerto Rico after Hurricanes Irma and Maria left more than 90 percent of the island without cellphone coverage. Just seven days later, the Federal Communications Commission Friday gave the company a green light to fly 30 balloons over Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands for up to six months. If all goes to plan, Alphabet's balloons will soon help replace the thousands of cellphone towers knocked out of service by hurricane-strength winds. The balloons would provide voice and data service through local carriers to users’ phones. The details of those arrangements aren’t complete. But in its application to the FCC, Alphabet included letters and emails from eight wireless carriers in Puerto Rico, in which they consented for Loon to use their frequencies for disaster relief and to restore limited communications."</em> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-closer-to-using-balloons-for-telecom-in-puerto-rico/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket took off from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California at 8:37 a.m. EDT (1237 GMT/5:37 a.m. EDT), carrying 10 satellites for Iridium Communications, as part of the company's Iridium Next constellation. The first stage of the two-stage Falcon 9 landed on SpaceX's drone ship "Just Read the Instructions" in the Pacific about 7.5 minutes after the launch. "Looks like we've got a good orbit," said John Insprucker, SpaceX's Falcon 9 principal integration engineer, just after the launch during live webcast commentary. The Iridium Next satellites were deployed 57 minutes after liftoff, with the entire process taking about 15 minutes, according to a SpaceX flight plan. "We're 10 for 10!" Insprucker said."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/38396-spacex-launches-iridium3-satellites-sticks-rocket-landing.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"GTC Europe - NVIDIA today announced that Deutsche Post DHL Group (DPDHL), the world's largest mail and logistics company, and ZF, one of the world's largest automotive suppliers, have partnered together to deploy a test fleet of autonomous delivery trucks, starting in 2018. DPDHL will outfit electric light trucks with the ZF ProAI self-driving system, based on NVIDIA DRIVE™ PX technology, for automating package transportation and delivery, including the "last mile" of deliveries. Taking packages from a central point to their final destinations is considered the most complex and costliest aspect of courier and e-commerce deliveries. DPDHL currently has a fleet of 3,400 StreetScooter electric delivery vehicles, which can be equipped with ZF's multiple sensors, including cameras, lidar and radar, that feed into the ZF ProAI system. This can enable the vehicle to use AI to understand its environment, plan a safe path forward, proceed along a selected route and park itself -- ensuring deliveries can be made with greater accuracy and safety, and at lower cost. "The development of autonomous delivery vehicles demonstrates how AI and deep learning are also reshaping the commercial transportation industry," said Jensen Huang, NVIDIA founder and CEO."</em> <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/deutsche-post-dhl-group-selects-nvidia-drive-px-for-autonomous-delivery-truck-fleet">[...]</a>

<p><em>"On Thursday 12 October an asteroid the size of a house will be watched carefully by astrophysicists as it hurtles “damn close” to Earth. The large space rock, named 2012 TC4, was first spotted five years ago by the Pan-STARRS telescope at the Haleakala Observatory, in Hawaii, before disappearing as it orbits the sun. It then reemerged in July on a trajectory well inside our lunar orbit. Scientists have said the asteroid is on course to pass safely by, just south of Australia, and poses no threat. However it presents space agencies with a rare opportunity to test the planet’s space defences and wargame what they would do if a larger, more threatening asteroid was detected heading straight for Earth. How close will TC4 come to Earth?"</em> <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/asteroid-2012-tc4-pass-damn-close-earth-tomorrow-give-rare-chance/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Samsung releases ISOCELL Fast 2L9 with Dual Pixel technology and ISOCELL Slim 2X7 with Tetracell technology Samsung Electronics, a world leader in advanced semiconductor technology, today introduced two new ISOCELL image sensors: 1.28-micrometer (μm) 12-megapixel (Mp) ISOCELL Fast 2L9 with Dual Pixel technology, and ultra-small 0.9μm 24Mp ISOCELL Slim 2X7 with Tetracell technology. Samsung ISOCELL image sensors fall into four categories—Fast, Slim, Bright and Dual—depending on their key attributes. As market demand for sleeker smartphones with advanced features increases, ISOCELL Fast 2L9 and Slim 2X7 both offer high resolution image sensors in small chip packages, delivering detailed pictures in low-light environments without a camera bump. ISOCELL Fast 2L9  With Dual Pixel technology, the ISOCELL Fast 2L9 delivers ultra-fast auto-focus at a reduced pixel size from the previous Dual Pixel sensor’s 1.4μm to 1.28μm. Dual Pixel technology employs two photodiodes in each and every pixel of the sensor instead of only one. With 12 million focus detecting pixels, the sensor is able to not only quickly focus on small still objects, but also lock on and track moving objects without losing focus, even in low-light environments."</em>  <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsungs-new-image-sensors-bring-fast-and-slim-attributes-to-mobile-and-iot-applications">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scientists have taken a big step towards creating the next generation of batteries, as well as more effective water treatment and better alternative energy after defying one of nature’s most fundamental rules on an atomic scale. An international team of researchers has found a way to avoid the established principle that particles of the same charge repel each other – and opposite charges attract. Charged atoms or molecules (ions) normally take on what is called Coulombic ordering where they sequence themselves in positive and negative succession along a straight line. However, in a new paper, ‘Partial breaking of the Coulombic ordering of ionic liquids confined in carbon nanopores', the team shows how this normal Coulombic ordering starts to break down when ions are confined in miniscule carbon pores, less than a nanometer in diameter. Disrupting the natural order of charged particles is important for the development of electrical energy storage devices such as batteries and supercapacitors, and could be pivotal for water treatment and alternative energy production technologies – which all involve ions packed into nanoporous materials. Loughborough University’s Professor Mark Biggs, Dean of School of Science and Professor of Interfacial Science and Engineering, was part of the team and played a vital role in the 3D molecular modelling work that was central to interpreting the experimental data that led to the discovery."</em>  <a href="http://www.lboro.ac.uk/news-events/news/2017/september/coulombic-disordering/">[...]</a>

Carnegie Mellon University chemist Krzysztof Matyjaszewski, with collaborators at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of Akron, has come up with a methodology that fine tunes the characteristics of brush polymers to allow them to more closely mimic the characteristics of biological materials. Their technique is published as a letter in the Sept. 28 issue of Nature. As a rule, when chemists make linear polymers with elastic properties called elastomers, they can make the materials stiff or stretchy but not both. This makes producing strong, flexible materials like those needed for many biomaterials extremely difficult. In addition, linear polymers are made using trial and error and often involve mixing different chemicals and solvents, which limits chemists’ ability to control the material’s properties and can make the material non-biocompatible by causing inflammation."</em>  <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2017/october/building-better-biomaterials.html">[...]</a>

More modern neodymium magnets have an advantage over SmCo5 because of their greater maximum energy. But the new magnet removes most of the disadvantages of SmCo5 while preserving its superior high-temperature efficiency over the neodymium magnets. Unfortunately, substituting all cobalt atoms for iron, -- which has a larger magnetic moment that helps increase the maximum energy product -- makes the ordinary hexagonal phase thermodynamically unstable.

Devices around the home, such as WiFi light bulbs and smart thermostats, are also on the increase. However, current technology limits the capability to interact with these devices. Hand gestures have been suggested as an intuitive and easy way of interacting with and controlling smart devices in different surroundings."</em>  <a href="http://bristol.ac.uk/news/2017/october/echoflex.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/air-breathing-battery-making-renewable-power-more-viable-grid-1011">Making renewable power more viable for the grid</a></h2>

<p><em>"“Air-breathing” battery can store electricity for months, for about a fifth the cost of current technologies. Wind and solar power are increasingly popular sources for renewable energy. But intermittency issues keep them from connecting widely to the U.S. grid: They require energy-storage systems that, at the cheapest, run about $100 per kilowatt hour and function only in certain locations. Now MIT researchers have developed an “air-breathing” battery that could store electricity for very long durations for about one-fifth the cost of current technologies, with minimal location restraints and zero emissions. The battery could be used to make sporadic renewable power a more reliable source of electricity for the grid. For its anode, the rechargeable flow battery uses cheap, abundant sulfur dissolved in water."</em>  <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/air-breathing-battery-making-renewable-power-more-viable-grid-1011">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A ceramic-based mechanical pump able to operate at record temperatures of more than 1,400 degrees Celsius (1,673 Kelvin) can transfer high temperature liquids such as molten tin, enabling a new generation of energy conversion and storage systems. The new pump could facilitate high efficiency, low-cost thermal storage, providing a new way to store renewable energy generated by wind and solar power, and facilitate an improved process for generating hydrogen directly from fuels such as methane – without producing carbon dioxide. Use of ceramic components, normally considered too brittle for mechanical systems, was made possible by precision machining – and seals made from another high-temperature material: graphite. The research was supported by the Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy (ARPA-E) and reported in the October 12 issue of the journal Nature. The pump was developed by researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology with collaborators from Purdue University and Stanford University. “Until now, we’ve had a ceiling for the highest temperatures at which we could move heat and store it, so this demonstration really enables energy advances, especially in renewables,” said Asegun Henry, an assistant professor in Georgia Tech’s Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering."</em>  <a href="http://www.news.gatech.edu/2017/10/10/ceramic-pump-moves-molten-metal-record-1400-degrees-celsius">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Industrial forecasts predict an insatiable need for battery farms to store renewable energy like solar and wind. Lithium ion batteries may remain tops for sheer performance, but when cost-per-storage is factored in, a Stanford design based on sodium ions offers promise. As a warming world moves from fossil fuels toward renewable solar and wind energy, industrial forecasts predict an insatiable need for battery farms to store power and provide electricity when the sky is dark and the air is still. Against that backdrop, Stanford researchers have developed a sodium-based battery that can store the same amount of energy as a state-of-the-art lithium ion, at substantially lower cost. Stanford researchers are developing a sodium ion battery based on a compound related to table salt.

<p><em>"While hydrogen is often talked about as a pollution-free fuel of the future, especially for use in fuel cell electric vehicles, hydrogen can be used for much more than zero-emission cars. In fact, from enhancing the flexibility of the grid to greening agriculture, hydrogen could play a major role in a clean and resilient energy system. In an effort to bring that vision to fruition, the Department of Energy (DOE) has launched “Hydrogen at Scale,” or H2@Scale, an initiative that explores the potential for wide-scale hydrogen production and utilization in the United States to benefit many sectors of the economy. In support of the initiative scientists at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) have been increasingly turning their attention to hydrogen generation. “Hydrogen is a very nice intermediate energy carrier” said Berkeley Lab researcher Adam Weber. “There’s a big focus now to use hydrogen for other end uses, not just fuel cells and vehicles.” The problem with hydrogen is, while it is the most commonly occurring element on our planet, it does not exist anywhere in pure form."</em>  <a href="http://newscenter.lbl.gov/2017/10/06/reimagining-hydrogen-small-molecule-large-scale-ideas/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Public Domain Modulus Gear OpenSCAD code version 1.0 This code defines a gear based on its modulus rather than pitch in mm, Modulus is the ration of tooth count:diameter, effectively the pitch of the gear is modulus * pi, ie, a gear of mod=1 has a tooth pitch of 3.1514mm. The advantage of using modulus rather than pitch to define a gear is that it is very easy to prototype - for example, a gear of mod = 1 will have a diameter that matches the tooth count, with mod = 2, radius = tooth count. This code is based on the poblic domain Parametric Involute Spur Gear code by Leemon Baird found at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5505 The file here is designed as both a library file (just use include at the start of your own OpenSCAD file, after removing the modgear call), and as a customizer so you can create and download your own custom gears directly from Thingiverse! Note: If using the options of a square or hexagonal center hole, be aware that the size is diagonal (corner to corner) not the side length. This, for a square bore 4 mm an a side, the hole size should be set to 5.7 mm (This requires applying the Pythagorean theorem). "</em> <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2572111">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In the ten years since the previous edition of Readings in Database Systems, the field of data management has exploded. Database and data-intensive systems today operate over unprecedented volumes of data, fueled in large part by the rise of “Big Data” and massive decreases in the cost of storage and computation. Cloud computing and microarchitectural trends have made distribution and parallelism nearly ubiquitous concerns. Data is collected from an increasing variety of heterogeneous formats and sources in increasing volume, and utilized for an ever increasing range of tasks. As a result, commodity database systems have evolved considerably along several dimensions, from the use of new storage media and processor designs, up through query processing architectures, programming interfaces, and emerging application requirements in both transaction processing and analytics. It is an exciting time, with considerable churn in the marketplace and many new ideas from research."</em>  <a href="http://www.redbook.io/pdf/redbook-5th-edition.pdf">[...]</a>

There are many different fascinating tasks that honey bees can learn. For example honey bees have advanced navigation skills, can communicate position of resources by means of waggle dance, and they can learn to differentiate colors, shapes, and fragrances.

<p><em>"Serial ports are one of the easiest ways for PICs to communicate with other devices. However, event serial ports have their flaws, so in this tutorial, we will look at how a message protocol can increase the reliability of data transfers. Modern microcontrollers will usually have many device interface peripherals built into them, including I2C, SPI, UART, and CAN. While I2C and SPI are very specific to devices and heavily rely on either select signals or start/stop signals, UART is more free. One of the biggest disadvantages of UART is the lack of a clock signal, which can result in clock drift of either the transmitter or receiver (which results in a baud difference), frame errors, and even overrun errors when one of the buffers on either side is full. Of course, these problems are relativity easy to overcome with the use of timers, watchdogs, and events."</em>  <a href="https://diyhacking.com/pic-messaging-protocols-increase-data-transfer-reliability/">[...]</a>
