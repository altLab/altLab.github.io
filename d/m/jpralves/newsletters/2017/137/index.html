<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1911, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_von_Ohain">Hans von Ohain</a>. Este engenheiro aeronáutico alemão ficou conhecido por ter projectado o primeiro motor a jato operacional. Com apenas 22 anos, concebeu a sua teoria da propulsão a jacto, porque para voar mais rápido, os aviões podiam voar mais alto para a menor resistência do ar, mas lá, as hélices e os motores de pistão funcionavam mal. Ele viu os turbo-reactores como uma solução e fez a sua primeira patente no motor a jato de turbina a gás em 1935, quatro anos depois de Frank Whittle. Em Setembro de 1937, Ohain tinha um modelo de bancada com hidrogénio produzindo um impulso de 250 km. Ele projectou o turbo-jacto HeS3b que alimentou a primeira aeronave experimental, o He178, no seu voo inaugural histórico, a uma velocidade máxima de cerca de 560 km/h, a 27 de Agosto de 1939, perto de Rostock, na Alemanha. O primeiro jacto de Whittle voou mais tarde, em 1941. O seu trabalho continuado no motor de turbina a gás durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial resultou no abandono do conceito de fluxo centrífugo e na adopção do motor do tipo compressor de fluxo axial.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1922, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolay_Basov">Nikolay Basov</a>. Este físico soviético, mais conhecido pelo desenvolvimento do maser, o precursor do laser. Em 1955, enquanto trabalhava como aluno de pesquisa com Aleksandr Prokhorov na Academia Soviética de Ciências, ele criou um amplificador de microondas baseado em moléculas de amónia. Os dois cientistas partilharam o Prémio Nobel em 1964 (com o americano Charles Townes, que desenvolveu de forma independente um maser), para pesquisas básicas em electrónica quântica que levaram ao desenvolvimento tanto do maser como do laser. Estes dispositivos produzem feixes monocromáticos, paralelos e coerentes de microondas e luz, respectivamente. Basov passou a desenvolver o princípio do laser e introduziu a ideia de usar semicondutores para atingir a acção do laser.</p>

<p>Esta semana ficámos a saber que uma nova técnica que combina o Galileo e outras constelações de satnav para entregar rapidamente uma precisão de posicionamento menor do que a mão foi comprovada usando sinais de toda a Terra. Desenvolvida por uma equipa de pesquisa espanhola com a ESA, esta técnica de Posicionamento Rápido de Pontos Rápidos ou Fast-PPP poderia, no futuro, fornecer um posicionamento preciso de 10-20 cm mais rapidamente do que nunca para uma grande variedade de utilizadores, de topógrafos a carros sem motorista.</p>

<p>Ficámos também a saber que a NASA coma ajuda da inteligência artificial descobriu oito planetas a circundar uma estrela distante. O nosso sistema solar agora está empatado para a maioria dos planetas em torno de uma única estrela, com a recente descoberta de um oitavo planeta que gira em torno de Kepler-90, uma estrela parecida com o Sol, a 2,545 anos-luz da Terra. O planeta foi descoberto em dados do Kepler Space Telescope da NASA. O recém-descoberto Kepler-90i - um planeta quente e rochoso que orbita sua estrela uma vez a cada 14,4 dias - foi encontrado usando o sistema de "Machine Learning" da Google. Este sistema baseia-se numa abordagem da inteligência artificial em que os computadores "aprendem". Neste caso, os computadores aprenderam a identificar planetas ao encontrar em casos de dados Kepler onde o telescópio registou sinais de planetas além do nosso sistema solar, conhecidos como exo-planetas.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. São apresentados igualmente 22 tutoriais da tutorialpoint sob a forma de Ebook sobre diversos temas, como C++, Java, Python, SQL, PHP, CSS, HTML, SAS, Bootstrap, Unix, Android, etc.</p>

<p><em>"A new technique combining Galileo and other satnav constellations to rapidly deliver smaller than hand-sized positioning accuracy has been proven using signals from all over Earth. Developed by a Spanish research team with ESA, this Fast Precise Point Positioning, or Fast-PPP, technique could in future deliver precise 10–20 cm positioning more quickly than ever before to a wide variety of users, from surveyors to driverless cars. A standard mass-market single-frequency receiver – such as the chip inside your smartphone – typically delivers positioning accuracy of a few metres. The receiver picks up satnav signals from a minimum of four satellites to compute its longitude, latitude and altitude, as well as synchronising its internal clock with the highly accurate atomic clocks on the satellites and within the ground segment. Its overall positioning performance is limited by the combination of errors or uncertainties within the system. An industrial-grade multifrequency receiver will give improved performance but overall positioning accuracy is still constrained, owing to factors such as orbital clock errors, small variations in satellite orbits and – crucially – signal delays due to interference from the ionosphere, the electrically active outer layers of Earth’s atmosphere."</em> <a href="http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Engineering_Technology/Rapid_satnav_accuracy_down_to_the_palm_of_your_hand">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Our solar system now is tied for most number of planets around a single star, with the recent discovery of an eighth planet circling Kepler-90, a Sun-like star 2,545 light-years from Earth. The planet was discovered in data from NASA’s Kepler Space Telescope. The newly-discovered Kepler-90i – a sizzling hot, rocky planet that orbits its star once every 14.4 days – was found using machine learning from Google. Machine learning is an approach to artificial intelligence in which computers “learn.” In this case, computers learned to identify planets by finding in Kepler data instances where the telescope recorded signals from planets beyond our solar system, known as exoplanets. NASA will host a Reddit Ask Me Anything at 3 p.m. EST today on this discovery. “Just as we expected, there are exciting discoveries lurking in our archived Kepler data, waiting for the right tool or technology to unearth them,” said Paul Hertz, director of NASA’s Astrophysics Division in Washington."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/artificial-intelligence-nasa-data-used-to-discover-eighth-planet-circling-distant-star">[...]</a>

As collection of space data increases, NASA looks to cognitive radio, the infusion of artificial intelligence into space communications networks, to meet demand and increase efficiency. “Modern space communications systems use complex software to support science and exploration missions,” said Janette C. Briones, principal investigator in the cognitive communication project at NASA’s Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio. “By applying artificial intelligence and machine learning, satellites control these systems seamlessly, making real-time decisions without awaiting instruction.” To understand cognitive radio, it’s easiest to start with ground-based applications.

The main challenge for the perovskite field is not so much efficiency but stability. Unlike silicon cells, perovskites are soft crystalline materials and prone to problems due to decomposition over time. In a commercial context, this puts perovskites on a higher price tag than conventional silicon cells. There have therefore been many efforts in synthesizing perovskite materials that can maintain high efficiency over time."</em> <a href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/guanidinium-stabilizes-perovskite-solar-cells-at-1/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"University of Tokyo researchers and their collaborators at RIKEN observed an unexpectedly large thermomagnetic effect, called the anomalous Nernst effect, in an antiferromagnet, a type of magnetic material, for the first time. The study’s findings, demonstrating a new method for regulating thermoelectric performance, provides a novel and potentially useful guideline for the future exploration of thermoelectric materials. The anomalous Nernst effect is the voltage generated spontaneously when a magnetic conductor is exposed to a temperature gradient, even in the absence of a magnetic field. Since its discovery about a century ago, this effect was long assumed as being proportional to the magnetization of the material, thus appearing only in ferromagnets, which have strong magnetization, and was not expected to occur in materials with zero magnetization like antiferromagnets. Strikingly, the joint research team found a large anomalous Nernst effect in manganese-tin alloy Mn3Sn, an antiferromagnetic metal. The widely known anomalous Hall effect is the spontaneous voltage generated across an electric current commonly found in ferromagnets."</em> <a href="http://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/utokyo-research/research-news/new-technology-using-magnet-to-generate-electricity-from-heat.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scientists tracked elusive waves of charge and spin that precede and follow the mysterious emergence of superconductivity Superconductors carry electricity with perfect efficiency, unlike the inevitable waste inherent in traditional conductors like copper. But that perfection comes at the price of extreme cold—even so-called high-temperature superconductivity (HTS) only emerges well below zero degrees Fahrenheit. Discovering the ever-elusive mechanism behind HTS could revolutionize everything from regional power grids to wind turbines. Now, a collaboration led by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Brookhaven National Laboratory has discovered a surprising breakdown in the electron interactions that may underpin HTS. The scientists found that as superconductivity vanishes at higher temperatures, powerful waves of electrons begin to curiously uncouple and behave independently—like ocean waves splitting and rippling in different directions. “For the first time, we pinpointed these key electron interactions happening after superconductivity subsides,” said first author and Brookhaven Lab research associate Hu Miao."</em> <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=212619">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Autonomously flying microrobots with potential uses in crop pollination, search and rescue missions, surveillance, as well as high-resolution weather, climate and environmental monitoring Inspired by the biology of a bee, researchers at the Wyss Institute are developing RoboBees, manmade systems that could perform myriad roles in agriculture or disaster relief. A RoboBee measures about half the size of a paper clip, weighs less that one-tenth of a gram, and flies using “artificial muscles” compromised of materials that contract when a voltage is applied. Additional modifications allow some models of RoboBee to transition from swimming underwater to flying, as well as “perch” on surfaces using static electricity. The masterminding of the RoboBee was motivated by the idea to develop autonomous micro-aerial vehicles capable of self-contained, self-directed flight and of achieving coordinated behavior in large groups. To that end, the RoboBee development is broadly divided into three main components: the Body, Brain, and Colony. Body development consists of constructing robotic insects able to fly on their own with the help of a compact and seamlessly integrated power source; brain development is concerned with “smart” sensors and control electronics that mimic the eyes and antennae of a bee, and can sense and respond dynamically to the environment; the Colony’s focus is about coordinating the behavior of many independent robots so they act as an effective unit."</em> <a href="https://wyss.harvard.edu/technology/autonomous-flying-microrobots-robobees/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://news.yale.edu/2017/12/07/creating-new-kind-metallic-glass">Creating a new kind of metallic glass</a></h2>

<p><em>"By shrinking samples of metallic glass to nanoscale size, Yale researchers have discovered they can create new materials with potentially new applications. The research, published today in Nature Communications, was conducted as part of Yale’s Center for Research on Interface Structures and Phenomena (CRISP), and led by Judy Cha, the Carol and Douglas Melamed Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering &amp; Materials Science, and Jan Schroers, professor of mechanical engineering &amp; materials science. Metallic glasses are a relatively new class of materials made from complex, multicomponent alloys. They have the moldable pliability of plastics, but the strengths of metals. When metallic glasses cool from a liquid to a solid, their atoms settle into a random arrangement and do not crystallize the way traditional metals do. Cha said they discovered a new form of metallic glasses by making metallic-glass rods so small that there is no room for the nuclei — a phenomenon the researchers call “nucleus starvation” — leading to a new crystalline phase."</em> <a href="https://news.yale.edu/2017/12/07/creating-new-kind-metallic-glass">[...]</a>

<p><em>"New design could dramatically cut energy waste in electric vehicles, data centers, and the power grid. Power electronics, which do things like modify voltages or convert between direct and alternating current, are everywhere. They’re in the power bricks we use to charge our portable devices; they’re in the battery packs of electric cars; and they’re in the power grid itself, where they mediate between high-voltage transmission lines and the lower voltages of household electrical sockets. Power conversion is intrinsically inefficient: A power converter will never output quite as much power as it takes in. But recently, power converters made from gallium nitride have begun to reach the market, boasting higher efficiencies and smaller sizes than conventional, silicon-based power converters. Commercial gallium nitride power devices can’t handle voltages above about 600 volts, however, which limits their use to household electronics."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/device-makes-power-conversion-more-efficient-1207">[...]</a>

He must of somehow seen my "projects todo" list... Motorized WiFi Chassis is a simple WiFi controlled motorized open chassis generic platform that uses an Adafruit Feather Huzzah ESP8266 for communication and control, and two continuous rotation servos plus a lithium ion battery for movement. The chassis contains 8 6mm by 1 threaded mounting points to mount, well, more to come on that. I've included the source code in the form of an Arduino sketch for the Adafruit Feather Huzzah ESP8266 if you wish to modify it. Also, you will need soldering skills and soldering equipment, wire, and all parts listed in the first step, plus an Arduino IDE with appropriate libraries installed in order to complete Motorized WiFi Chassis.

A better name for the game could very well be Russian Roulette, however we wanted to go with a more family friendly name. The game involves the user to press the middle button on the Basys board to randomly assign one of the 16 switches to be active with a bomb.

<p><em>"In 1977, NASA launched the spacecraft Voyager 1 into the void. Some circumstantial planetary alignment meant that the probe was slingshot past our solar system, set on a course of interstellar exploration. Forty years later, the Voyager 1 mission now marks the furthermost point of humanitys reach into our universe. Still transmitting data back to earth, Voyager 1 pushes the boundaries of human exploration with each passing second. I have a personal fascination for the Voyager missions, and wanted to make a display that captured their spirit. When the display flashes a number, it represents the distance in miles between Voyager 1 and earth, an objective measurement for the possibilities of human imagination."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Voyager-1/">[...]</a>

I know, Kindergarten is way too early to learn binary math, but probably by the time I finish writing the tutorials, she'l be in High School. :) To ease some of the frustration of Assembly and Machine language coding, I wrote a C program that parses and compiles a faux Assembly language that is a little easier to read and understand.

The illusion has also been described as "retinal persistence",persistence of impressions" or simply "persistence" and other variations. The working of Arduino POV is based on the principle of persistence of vision. The human brain stores the visual for atleast tp sec . So any change within tp seconds gets unnoticed.
