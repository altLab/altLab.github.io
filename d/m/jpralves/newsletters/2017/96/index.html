<p>Nasceu em 1908, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Bruch">Walter Bruch</a>. É atribuído a este engenheiro electrotécnico Alemão a invenção do sistema de codificação de televisão a cores PAL. Foi em Janeiro de 1963 que foi feita a apresentação ao publico deste sistema. Quando perguntaram a Bruch porque não designar o sistema por "Sistema Bruch", este respondeu que seria uma má opção por Bruch significar "partir" em alemão.
Também faz anos hoje que nascia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Condon">Edward U. Condon</a>. Este físico Norte-Americano nascido em 1902 no estado do Novo México ficou conhecido pelo principio Franck-Condon, pelo desenvolvimento do radar e pela contribuição para o desenho de equipamento de separação magnética que mais tarde foi usado para processar urânio para as bombas atómicas. O principio Franck-Condon é um tratado da mecânica quântica que em qualquer sistema molecular a transição de um estado de energia para outro a ocorrer tão perto do instantâneo que os núcleos dos átomos envolvidos são estacionários.</p>

<p>Esta semana o Raspberry PI fez cinco anos e para comemorar a data, a fundação Raspberry Pi lançou um novo Raspberry Pi Zero W. As grandes diferenças entre este e o Zero original são a introdução de Wi-Fi 802.11b/g/n e Bluetooth 4.0 apresentando um custo muito acessível de 10 dólares.
A SpaceX anunciou que irá promover uma viagem à volta da Lua para dois passageiros já no próximo ano. O custo da viagem será suportado pelos passageiros e não foram dados mais detalhes sobre os mesmos.
A NASA disponibilizou esta semana para o público diverso software e ferramentas que desenvolveu. A lista disponibilizada incorpora contribuições de todos os centros da agência em processamento / armazenamento de dados, sistemas de negócios, operações, propulsão e aeronáutica. Inclui muitas das ferramentas que a NASA usa para explorar o espaço e ampliar nossa compreensão do universo.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis. Saiu a revista MagPI numero 55 de Março e são apresentados dois Ebooks sobre Segurança Básica na Internet e Tutoriais Básicos em Electrónica.</p>

<p><em>"LEGO already has millions of applications, building everything from castles to spaceships. But researchers in California have found a new use for the popular blocks – a modular microfluidics system. Microfluidics is a rapidly emerging technology with promising biomedical applications. It involves fluid manipulation at the microscale, where the fluid is usually set in motion by pressure regulators or syringe pumps. The researchers, from the Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of California, Irvine, used polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) – a silicone-based organic polymer – to cast the building blocks of a truly LEGO-like microfluidics platform. They describe the results of their research today in the Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering (JMM)."</em> <a href="http://ioppublishing.org/news/lego-like-blocks-open-up-new-possibilities-for-microfluidics/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"A team of engineers led by 94-year-old John Goodenough, professor in the Cockrell School of Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin and co-inventor of the lithium-ion battery, has developed the first all-solid-state battery cells that could lead to safer, faster-charging, longer-lasting rechargeable batteries for handheld mobile devices, electric cars and stationary energy storage. Goodenough’s latest breakthrough, completed with Cockrell School senior research fellow Maria Helena Braga, is a low-cost all-solid-state battery that is noncombustible and has a long cycle life (battery life) with a high volumetric energy density and fast rates of charge and discharge. The engineers describe their new technology in a recent paper published in the journal Energy &amp; Environmental Science."</em> <a href="http://engr.utexas.edu/news/8203-goodenough-batteries">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"For all the improvements in computer technology over the years, we still struggle to recreate the low-energy, elegant processing of the human brain. Now, researchers at Stanford University and Sandia National Laboratories have made an advance that could help computers mimic one piece of the brain’s efficient design – an artificial version of the space over which neurons communicate, called a synapse. “It works like a real synapse but it’s an organic electronic device that can be engineered,” said Alberto Salleo, associate professor of materials science and engineering at Stanford and senior author of the paper. “It’s an entirely new family of devices because this type of architecture has not been shown before. For many key metrics, it also performs better than anything that’s been done before with inorganics.”"</em> <a href="http://news.stanford.edu/2017/02/20/artificial-synapse-neural-networks/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"The Semiconductor Industry Association has estimated that at current rates of increase, computers’ energy requirements will exceed the world’s total power output by 2040. Using light rather than electricity to move data would dramatically reduce computer chips’ energy consumption, and the past 20 years have seen remarkable progress in the development of silicon photonics, or optical devices that are made from silicon so they can easily be integrated with electronics on silicon chips. But existing silicon-photonic devices rely on different physical mechanisms than the high-end optoelectronic components in telecommunications networks do. The telecom devices exploit so-called second-order nonlinearities, which make optical signal processing more efficient and reliable. In the latest issue of Nature Photonics, MIT researchers present a practical way to introduce second-order nonlinearities into silicon photonics. They also report prototypes of two different silicon devices that exploit those nonlinearities: a modulator, which encodes data onto an optical beam, and a frequency doubler, a component vital to the development of lasers that can be precisely tuned to a range of different frequencies."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/new-resource-optical-chips-0220">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Imagine you’re waiting in your car and a poster for a concert from a local band catches your eye. What if you could just tune your car to a radio station and actually listen to that band’s music? Or perhaps you see the poster on the side of a bus stop. What if it could send your smartphone a link for discounted tickets or give you directions to the venue? Going further, imagine you go for a run, and your shirt can sense your perspiration and send data on your vital signs directly to your phone. A new technique pioneered by University of Washington engineers makes these “smart” posters and clothing a reality by allowing them to communicate directly with your car’s radio or your smartphone. For instance, bus stop billboards could send digital content about local attractions. A street sign could broadcast the name of an intersection or notice that it is safe to cross a street, improving accessibility for the disabled. In addition, clothing with integrated sensors could monitor vital signs and send them to a phone."</em> <a href="http://www.washington.edu/news/2017/03/01/singing-posters-and-talking-shirts-uw-engineers-turn-everyday-objects-into-fm-radio-stations/">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="http://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/press/molecular_robot.html">Shape-shifting molecular robots respond to DNA signals</a></h2>

<p><em>"A research group at Tohoku University and Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology has developed a molecular robot consisting of biomolecules, such as DNA and protein. The molecular robot was developed by integrating molecular machines into an artificial cell membrane. It can start and stop its shape-changing function in response to a specific DNA signal. This is the first time that a molecular robotic system has been able to recognize signals and control its shape-changing function. What this means is that molecular robots could, in the near future, function in a way similar to living organisms. Using sophisticated biomolecules such as DNA and proteins, living organisms perform important functions. For example, white blood cells can chase bacteria by sensing chemical signals and migrating toward the target. In the field of chemistry and synthetic biology, elemental technologies for making various molecular machines, such as sensors, processors and actuators, are created using biomolecules."</em> <a href="http://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/press/molecular_robot.html">[...]</a></p>

Imagine: an ultrathin smart tablet that can be stretched from mini-size to extra large. Or a rubber band-like wrist monitor that measures one’s heartbeat. Or wallpaper that turns an entire wall into an electronic display. These are some of the potential applications of the stretchable smart fabric developed in the lab of Chuan Wang, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering. And because the material can be produced on a standard printer, it has a major potential cost advantage over current technologies that are expensive to manufacture."</em> <a href="http://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2017/is-a-stretchable-smart-tablet-in-our-future/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"A short range FM transmitter is a low-power FM radio transmitter that broadcasts a signal from a portable audio device (such as an MP3 player) to a standard FM radio. Most of these transmitters plug into the device's headphone jack and then broadcast the signal over an FM broadcast band frequency, so that it can be picked up by any nearby radio. This allows portable audio devices to make use of the louder or better sound quality of a home audio system or car stereo without requiring a wired connection. Being low-powered, most transmitters typically have a short range of 100–300 feet (30–100 meters), depending on the quality of the receiver, obstructions and elevation. Typically they broadcast on any FM frequency from 87.5 to 108.0 MHz in most of the world . In this project we design the circuit in such a way that ,the circuit will collect the input through aux cable and broadcast with in FM frequency range. The broadcasted output can be collected with a FM radio. Now I am going to instruct how to make a FM Transmitter with less number of components."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-FM-Transmitter/">[...]</a></p>

The firmware created achieve several milestones that makes the cypress device usage even more friendly, since the analog board kit already has plenty of hardware to play with, this project focus to exploit them to bring a better co-processor as will be presented. The project uses the famous ESP-01 (esp8266) as the Host processor running micropython to gather sensor data from cypress co-processor and also control it using a serial port to communicate them at the physical layer. On top is a protocol based on MessagePack to allow not only communication but a smart semantic data interchange that allows expandability and reduce developing time. The later is achieved by using some C programming tricks that came really handy taking into account the limited memory of cypress device. Due to the fact that such a communication protocol was implemented, the coprocessor can easily integrate with a variety of Host processor that can handle it which specially true due to the several existent ports of MessagePack. A front end implementation geared towards the IoT trend is implemented using freeboard.io running as a local server in raspberry pi. The implementation highlight with beautiful results the effort made on lower layers from Cypress getting into Host to reach the End user.

It incorporates a simple design utilizing parallel mosfets to allow a higher amperage rating and requires 4 wires to control each bridge, 2 digital and 2 PWM capable. You can find the files to build one here: https://sites.google.com/site/arduinorobotics/home/chapter8 The high-side switches in each bridge are high-power P-channel mosfets intended to be digitally controlled (On or Off) using a set of small n-channel signal transistors (2n7000). One signal transistor can supply up to 200mA of current to each set of P-channel mosfets to turm them On, while 2.2k pull-up resistors keep them turned off when not in use. While the schematic shows the signal transistors as 2n7000 n-channel mosfets, you can substitute these for standard 2n2222 BJT signal transistors as they will both fit. The low-side switches are high-power N-channel mosfets controlled by a PWM signal from a microcontroller which is passed through a mosfet driver IC (TC4427) to buffer the signals making ultrasonic PWM frequencies possible (32kHz tested). The low-side switches have gate resistors to ensure even current levels to each mosfet from the driver IC, and shottkey diodes at each gate to close the mosfet more quickly, which will allow for higher switching speeds. Each signal input is grounded thorugh a pull-down resistor to ensure that all switches are turned off when not controlled by the microcontroller."</em> <a href="https://prototyperobotics.com/projects/2x4-h-bridge">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Since writing up the article on how to build a simple Arduino home energy meter which measured the energy consumption for a single phase, I’ve had a number of people ask about doing a 3 phase energy meter. While there is a range of commercially available single phase energy meters available, the 3 phase meters aren’t nearly as common and tend to be quite expensive. So I decided to take the opportunity to build a 3 phase energy meter and fix up a couple of areas in the original energy meter’s code which could have been done better. Again, with this meter I was going for simplicity. Sure, for perfectly accurate measurements you need to measure both the supply current and voltage but for this application and in the interests of keeping the energy meter simple and safe – only requiring a non-contact connection to your mains – I’ve decide to stick with a simple current measurement which gives you an estimate to within a couple of decimal points of a kilowatt hour. This meter measures the supply current through each phase using a CT (current transformer) and then does a few calculations to give you the current, power, maximum power and kilowatt hours consumed for each phase. With a few changes to the code, you can also add your local tariffs and display the cost of electricity used to date."</em> <a href="http://www.the-diy-life.com/simple-3-phase-arduino-energy-meter/">[...]</a></p>

I built this because I have the parts on hand, I enjoy building it, and I learn how to control ultrasonic sensor, relay module and solenoid with Arduino. My office is free to enter for almost any workers, because I keep the tools in it. We also keep mineral water by the door, so regular customers just open my door and grab the cups of water. Well, sometimes we are just too busy to get them so we tell them to take by themselves. When I am in my room, the door is at my back. You can say it is not good in Feng Shui way, but what can I say, this is the best position for me to get a better air circulation in this non air-conditioned room. And also this way I can see the front gate through my window. So let's say it is the door that is misplaced :D I see that this solenoid can do the knock for me, to let me know when someone is entering my office and I can take a glance at the door before it is opened. Some uninvited will just shock with the knocking sound and decide to leave because they know that the room is under surveillance. I hope so..."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Auto-Knock/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"In some situations, in your designs with Arduino and microcontrollers, you can use a shift register like 74HC595 to directly trigger LED, LED array and displays, but if you check the datasheet, you will see that you need to be careful with the maximum current in each output and also with the total current do not damage the device. These are important information that we do not normally care about in our projects at home (including myself) and I would like to explain this problem to you and then you can go ahead applying more reliable and robust solutions! This overview will help you understand differences and design alternatives using the 74HC595, ULN2803, UDN2981 and transistors. I hope you enjoy it and that it will be useful."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/lagsilva/robust-design-combining-74hc595-uln2803-udn2981-and-bc327-45ce8b">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"The resurgence of Battlebots in the States and Robot Wars in the UK reignited my love of combat robotics. So I found a local group of bot builders and dived right in. We fight at the UK ant weight scale (150 gram weight limit) and I quickly realised the traditional way to build a bot involved RC gear: an expensive RC transmitter, a bulky or expensive receiver and ESCs (electronic speed controllers) which are magic boxes that can handle way more current than is necessary for a bot of this size. Having used Arduino in the past I wanted to try and do things differently and set myself a goal of an Arduino system that can receive a combat legal signal and control two drive motors for around USD$5 (half the cost of a cheap ESC) To help achieve this goal I remixed this RC car instructable, reducing the weight/cost of the receiver and generating 4 PWM signals to run a cheap h-bridge chip. This instructable will focus on the Arduino control system but I'll add additional information to help new people build their first bot"</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Cheap-Arduino-Combat-Robot-Control/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"A while ago I posted a tutorial on how you can connect MPU9250 Accelerometer, Gyroscope and Compass Sensor to Arduino Nano and program it with Visuino to send packet data and display it on a Scope and Visual Instruments. The Accelerometer sends X, Y, and Z acceleration forces. Often however we need to convert the forces into X, Y, Z 3D angle to determine the 3D Orientation of the sensor. Quite few people requested such tutorial, and finally I have found time to make it. Some people also asked how you can connect and use MPU6050 Accelerometer and Gyroscope Sensor, so I decided to use this module for the tutorial instead of the more complex and expensive MPU9250. In this Tutorial, I will show you how easy it is to connect MPU6050 Accelerometer and Gyroscope Sensor to Arduino Nano, and program it with Visuino to convert the Acceleration into a 3D X, Y, Z Angle."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Nano-and-Visuino-Convert-Acceleration-to-A/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"So I'm guessing that I'm like a large amount of people on this site that are low key hoarders, keeping anything they could turn into a project or salvage for parts and this is an example of that. I have this old Mad Catz Steering wheel for the Xbox 360 and now that I have an Xbox one I don't really have any use for it anymore so decided to use it to control a toy car through Bluetooth. I would've liked to connect the USB to a Raspberry Pi but wasn't sure how to process the information from the USB so I just took it apart, identified the components I could use and designed my own circuit which would be controlled by an Arduino Uno. So in this post, I'll go through the steps on how I made this project. This is my first project on this site so forgive any mistakes."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Controlling-Robot-Over-Bluetooth-Using-Xbox-Steeri/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"What this project is able to do is that when put into soil the soil moisture sensor is able to detect the amount of water in the soil and display the amount on the LCD screen. Then depending on the amount of water a corresponding light color LED will light up based on the appropriate amount of water. When the amount of water gets too low the light will flash red and the piezo buzzer will make a chirp noise allerting you to water the plant."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Its-Watering-Time/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"This is a home alarm system that is not just a fun toy, but is actually usable and useful in everyday life. I built it because I realized that I already had most of the necessary components for it, and because I wanted to see whether I could make it work. This means it is not the cheapest or the simplest solution, so while describing the system and how to build it, I will also mention possible ways to simplify or customize it to your needs. The system consists of 2 units, both of them inside your home. The main one (sender) detects when the door is open, and the secondary one (receiver) sounds a siren that is loud enough to attract attention. When you leave your home, you touch an RFID card/tag to the reader next to the door to activate the system. When you come home (or someone else opens the door) a wireless signal is sent instantly. The secondary unit receives that signal, and a countdown is started, giving you some time to enter your home and disable the alarm without disturbing the neighbors. When you touch your RFID card/tag to the reader, a second wireless signal is sent that stops the countdown and turns the alarm off. If the second signal is not received (because the person entering your home does not have the correct RFID tag) the siren kicks in and makes a loud noise for about a minute."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Wireless-Home-Alarm-System-Using-an-Arduino-and-RF/">[...]</a></p>
