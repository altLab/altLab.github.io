Foram feitas algumas alterações para melhorar a leitura da Newsletter. Esperemos que gostem.</p>

<p>No capitulo dos aniversários, faz hoje anos que nascia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bunsen">Robert Bunsen</a>. A este químico alemão deve-se a descoberta do césio e do rubídio em conjunto com o físico Gustav Kirchhoff. Foi responsável pelo desenvolvimento de vários métodos de análise de gás, foi pioneiro em fotoquímica, e fez o trabalho inicial no campo da química organoarsenica. Conjuntamente com o seu assistente desenvolveu o famoso Bico de Bunsen que produz uma única chama de gás aberta, que é usada para aquecimento, esterilização ou combustão. Faz também anos que nascia em 1862  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_James_Rogers">Leonard James Rogers</a>. Este matemático inglês foi o primeiro a descobrir a identidade Rogers-Ramanujan e a desigualdade de Hölder, e que introduziu polinómios de Rogers. Os polinómios de Rogers-Szegő foram nomeados após ele.</p>

<p>Nas notícias da semana a Google resolveu centralizar todas as suas contribuições para o Open Source num local único. Este site contém informação de como usar, distribui e apoia o open source. Este novo site mostra a amplitude e profundidade do apoio da google no código aberto. Irá conter: programas, organizações que são apoiadas e uma lista abrangente de projetos de código aberto que foram lançados pela Google. Mas também contém algo muito interessante: um olhar sob o capot em como "fazer" código aberto.
Um homem paralisado pensou em mover o braço e, conseguiu fazê-lo. Uma tecnologia desenvolvida nos Estados Unidos permitiu que este homem usando sinais do cérebro conseguisse usar o braço e a mão.
A Domino's Pizza vai começar a usar robots para entregar pizzas na Alemanha e na Holanda. Estes veículos motorizados irão começar por entregar pizzas a clientes que se encontrem até um quilómetro de distância da loja.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. É apresentada a revista MagPI 56 de Abril de 2017. Saiu também a revista newelectronics de 28 de Março.</p>

<p><em>"Free and open source software has been part of our technical and organizational foundation since Google’s early beginnings. From servers running the Linux kernel to an internal culture of being able to patch any other team's code, open source is part of everything we do. In return, we've released millions of lines of open source code, run programs like Google Summer of Code and Google Code-in, and sponsor open source projects and communities through organizations like Software Freedom Conservancy, the Apache Software Foundation, and many others. Today, we’re launching opensource.google.com, a new website for Google Open Source that ties together all of our initiatives with information on how we use, release, and support open source. This new site showcases the breadth and depth of our love for open source. It will contain the expected things: our programs, organizations we support, and a comprehensive list of open source projects we've released. But it also contains something unexpected: a look under the hood at how we "do" open source."</em> <a href="http://opensource.googleblog.com/2017/03/a-new-home-for-google-open-source.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Bill Kochevar grabbed a mug of water, drew it to his lips and drank through the straw. His motions were slow and deliberate, but then Kochevar hadn’t moved his right arm or hand for eight years. And it took some practice to reach and grasp just by thinking about it. Kochevar, who was paralyzed below his shoulders in a bicycling accident, is believed to be the first person with quadriplegia in the world to have arm and hand movements restored with the help of two temporarily implanted technologies. A brain-computer interface with recording electrodes under his skull, and a functional electrical stimulation (FES) system* activating his arm and hand, reconnect his brain to paralyzed muscles. Holding a makeshift handle pierced through a dry sponge, Kochevar scratched the side of his nose with the sponge. He scooped forkfuls of mashed potatoes from a bowl—perhaps his top goal—and savored each mouthful."</em> <a href="http://thedaily.case.edu/man-quadriplegia-employs-injury-bridging-technologies-move-just-thinking/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The thinnest, smoothest layer of silver that can survive air exposure has been laid down at the University of Michigan, and it could change the way touchscreens and flat or flexible displays are made. It could also help improve computing power, affecting both the transfer of information within a silicon chip and the patterning of the chip itself through metamaterial superlenses. By combining the silver with a little bit of aluminum, the U-M researchers found that it was possible to produce exceptionally thin, smooth layers of silver that are resistant to tarnishing. They applied an anti-reflective coating to make one thin metal layer up to 92.4 percent transparent."</em> <a href="http://www.ns.umich.edu/new/releases/24683-transparent-silver-tarnish-proof-films-for-flexible-displays-touch-screens-metamaterials">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/speed-testing-traffic-management-data-center-networks-0321">Testing new networking protocols</a></h2>

<p><em>"The transmission control protocol, or TCP, which manages traffic on the internet, was first proposed in 1974. Some version of TCP still regulates data transfer in most major data centers, the huge warehouses of servers maintained by popular websites. That’s not because TCP is perfect or because computer scientists have had trouble coming up with possible alternatives; it’s because those alternatives are too hard to test. The routers in data center networks have their traffic management protocols hardwired into them. Testing a new protocol means replacing the existing network hardware with either reconfigurable chips, which are labor-intensive to program, or software-controlled routers, which are so slow that they render large-scale testing impractical. At the Usenix Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation later this month, researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory will present a system for testing new traffic management protocols that requires no alteration to network hardware but still works at realistic speeds — 20 times as fast as networks of software-controlled routers. The system maintains a compact, efficient computational model of a network running the new protocol, with virtual data packets that bounce around among virtual routers. On the basis of the model, it schedules transmissions on the real network to produce the same traffic patterns. Researchers could thus run real web applications on the network servers and get an accurate sense of how the new protocol would affect their performance."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/speed-testing-traffic-management-data-center-networks-0321">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://liu.se/en/article/organisk-elektronik-kan-hamta-kraft-i-vaggurtaget">Organic electronics can use power from socket</a></h2>

<p><em>"Printed electronics and organic light-emitting devices now perform at levels sufficient for a number of eco-friendly, energy-efficient applications. Previously the idea has been to drive the organic electronics using solar cells, batteries or wireless transformers, which works well in many cases. But for fixed installations like lighting, signage or UV-blocking windows, it is convenient to use a wall socket. Until now this has not been possible, because the high voltage damages the electronics. Docent Deyu Tu from LiU’s Division of Information Coding has led a project where colleagues at Umeå University joined forces to find a solution to this problem. And they have now been able to demonstrate an organic converter that makes it possible to drive organic light-emitting devices with high luminescence, and to charge supercapacitors, both using electricity from an ordinary wall socket. The converter consists of diode-connected organic thin-film transistors, operated at high voltages up to 325 V, with the capacity to transform high alternating current (AC) to a selected direct current (DC)."</em> <a href="https://liu.se/en/article/organisk-elektronik-kan-hamta-kraft-i-vaggurtaget">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The research group of Professor Akio Ishiguro and Assistant Professor Dai Owaki of Tohoku University have, for the first time, successfully demonstrated that by changing only its parameter related to speed, a quadruped robot can spontaneously change its steps between energy-efficient patterns (gait transition phenomena). Until now, the manner in which changing speeds cause quadrupeds to change their gaits - walking, trotting and galloping - is poorly understood. Through this study, the researchers successfully demonstrated the reproduction of the quadruped gait transition phenomena. They achieved this via a decentralized control scheme, using a simple local rule in which a leg continues to support the body while sensing weight on the corresponding leg."</em> <a href="http://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/press/quadruped_robot.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"With the first ever documented observation of the self-healing phenomena of graphene, researchers from Hyderabad, India, hint at future applications for its use in artificial skin. Graphene, which is, in simple terms, a sheet of pure carbon atoms and currently the world’s strongest material, is one million times thinner than paper; so thin that it is actually considered two dimensional. Notwithstanding its hefty price, graphene has quickly become a comer among the most promising nanomaterials due to its unique properties and versatile prospective applications. The paper by published in Open Physics refers to an extraordinary yet previously undocumented self-healing property of graphene’s, which could lead to the development of  flexible sensors that mimic the self-healing properties of human skin. The largest organ in the human body, skin has been known for its fascinating self-healing properties – but until now, emulating this phenomenon proved too much of a challenge as manmade materials lack this ability. Due to unprecedented stretching or bending and incidental scratches, artificial skin used in robots is extremely susceptible to ruptures and fissures. The study offers a novel solution where a sub-nano sensor uses graphene to sense a crack as soon as it starts nucleation, and surprisingly, even after the crack has spread a certain distance. This technology could quickly become viable for use in the next generation of electronics."</em> <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/dg/page/SELF-Healing-Observed-in-Graphene/selfhealing-observed-in-graphene">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In 2010, MIT launched its iPhone app to much fanfare from people on campus and beyond. Designed by a team led by Andrew Yu, then mobile platform manager and architect for MIT Information Services and Technology, the app provides access to the Institute’s news, campus maps, directory, shuttle tracker, emergency contacts, class locations, dining menus, and other information. Shortly following the app’s release — and inspired by its wide popularity — Yu left MIT and founded Modo Labs to commercialize the core platform, then called Kurogo, that simplifies app-building. The platform provides quick and easy access to back-end data and a simple mobile app-assembly interface, so people without programming skills can build apps and app modules. Today, Modo Labs’ platform is being used by 200 universities and colleges, as well as Fortune 500 companies and hospitals worldwide, reaching millions of users. In the near future, Yu wants the platform to be adopted by 1,000 higher education institutions and other organizations. “It’s spreading globally,” Yu says. “We’ve grown 100 percent over the last year, so we’re excited to expand.”"</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/modo-labs-kurogo-apps-0322">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/self-assembly-smaller-microchip-patterns-0327">A big leap toward tinier lines</a></h2>

<p><em>"For the last few decades, microchip manufacturers have been on a quest to find ways to make the patterns of wires and components in their microchips ever smaller, in order to fit more of them onto a single chip and thus continue the relentless progress toward faster and more powerful computers. That progress has become more difficult recently, as manufacturing processes bump up against fundamental limits involving, for example, the wavelengths of the light used to create the patterns. Now, a team of researchers at MIT and in Chicago has found an approach that could break through some of those limits and make it possible to produce some of the narrowest wires yet, using a process with the potential to be economically viable for mass manufacturing with standard types of equipment. The new findings are reported this week in the journal Nature Nanotechnology, in a paper by postdoc Do Han Kim, graduate student Priya Moni, and Professor Karen Gleason, all at MIT, and by postdoc Hyo Seon Suh, Professor Paul Nealey, and three others at the University of Chicago and Argonne National Laboratory. While there are other methods that can achieve such fine lines, the team says, none of them are cost-effective for large-scale manufacturing."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/self-assembly-smaller-microchip-patterns-0327">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/mecheng/news-events/new-laser-1.686634">New revolutionary laser technique could lead to faster, smaller and cheaper 3D printing technologies</a></h2>

<p><em>"A new 3D printing/additive manufacturing process using energy efficient diode lasers is set to change the way parts are produced, according to researchers at the University of Sheffield. Laser melting systems are increasingly being used in high-value sectors like aerospace and automotive to manufacture metallic and plastics parts in layers from powder. However, this process is limited as it relies on a mirror to deflect a single laser, curbing the speed of the system. The new process, called Diode Area Melting (DAM), can overcome this by melting large areas in parallel using an array of individual laser diodes. These laser beams can be switched on or off as they move across the powder bed making it faster but also more energy efficient. Dr Kristian Groom, from the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, said: “Our research challenges the long held belief in the industry that low power diode modules cannot achieve sufficient melting due to their low power and poor beam quality."</em> <a href="http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/mecheng/news-events/new-laser-1.686634">[...]</a>

Alexa is capable of voice interaction, music playback, making to-do lists, setting alarms, streaming podcasts, playing audiobooks, and providing weather, traffic, and other real time information. Alexa can also control several smart devices using itself as a home automation hub. We will use on this project, the "Echo-Dot", that allows users to activate the device using a wake-word (such as "Alexa"). In the home automation space, Alexa can interact with several different devices as Philips Hue, Belkin Wemo, SmartThings, etc. In our case, we will emulate the WeMo. WeMo is a series of products from Belkin International, Inc. that enables users to control home electronics from anywhere. The product suite includes a switch, motion sensor, Insight Switch, light switch, camera and app. The WeMo Switch (our case here) can be plugged into any home outlet, which can then be controlled from an iOS or Android smartphone running the WeMo App, via home WiFi or mobile phone network."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/When-IoT-Meets-AI-Home-Automation-With-Alexa-and-N/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This easy project was developed to test the top speed of a stepper motor controlled by an Adafruit Motorshield as part of a class assignment (University of North Carolina at Charlotte's Junior Design). After throwing it together, we quickly realized that this became an important diagnostic tool for a larger project. The larger project requires the use of stepper motors, controlled by an Adafruit Motorshield v2. Initially, we used this tachometer to test the top speed of the motors (with no load) to compare against manufacturer specifications. However, we found that this served nicely a code-verification tool as well. When a desired motor speed was programmed using a variety of available libraries, we found that the actual motor speeds differed significantly. Since the larger project is a time-based competition, this had significant implications for our end performance. We decided that we could use this to reconcile our programmed speeds with actual speeds rather than spend countless hours trying figure out why we weren't reaching the speeds we expected. And, in the spirit of good sportsmanship, we wanted to share this with others that might find this as useful as we have. With some slight adjustments to the code, this project can be adapted to many platforms. Generally, the only difference between most platforms and the Teensy is the way the interrupts are attached. I just happened to have a Teensy 3.2 sitting around, collecting dust."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/ecarter/quick-tachometer-2c95ec">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Often I need to log in to my mail accounts or to log in to my University profile from a pc that is not mine. I tipically use 10 characters or more password using numbers, symbols, upper and lower case letters. A nightmare to remember and even worse to type in right at first try. And sometimes one of my relatives have problems remembering a password, such as wifi or similar stuff. So I came up with this new idea. PassType (yeah... I like to give names to the stuff I build, this name comes from the contraction of "password type in device") is a very cheap and simple to use password manager, capable of storing more than 250 passwords and to type them in every device! It works with every computer and it can even be plugged and used on smartphones. Every system supporting some sort of keyboard is compatible with PassType. This device has a small joystick-like 5-way tactile switch as input method. The small OLED display shows a functional and intuitive UI (user interface). All the datas are stored in a 32kb EEPROM. PassType is powered by an arduino Pro Micro. Pentesters or computer enthusiasts will be happy too because this small device can be used to perform tasks that are boring, repetitive or to type in hundreds of characters in few seconds. Actually it can do everything that a human in 15 minutes can do with mouse and keyboard in only few seconds. In this project I'll use a 32K EEPROM memory, but you can use even a bigger one.

Second problem. How to light up proper letter. I thought about using a PCB and soldering LEDs on it. Coincidentally on that time I saw a LED matrix modules.

<p><em>"The idea of this project came out when I bought a condensing gas boiler for my apartment. I don't have any drain close by for the condensed water the boiler produces. So the water is collected in a 20 liter tank (drum) for few days and when it gets filled up, i have to discharge it manually. So I decided to make an Arduino controlled pump which will discharge the water with only one push of the button. A display shows the status of the pump. I've added two level sensors to stop the pump if the drain is either overflowing or the level is dropping inside the collecting tank. This is important for the well functioning of the pump, in order to always be submerged."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Controlled-Pump-for-Draining-Water/">[...]</a>

A simple program allows the pumps to turn on for the required time to make a mixed drink.

So what is a raytracer anyway? The short version is it’s a computer program that traces the paths of simulated rays of light through a scene to produce high-quality 3D-rendered images. Despite that, it also happens to be the simplest way to render 3D images. Unfortunately, that comes at a cost in render time - raytracing an image takes much longer than the polygon-based rendering done by most game engines. This means that raytracing is typically used to produce beautiful still images or pre-rendered video (eg. Pixar’s RenderMan technology)."</em> <a href="https://bheisler.github.io/post/writing-raytracer-in-rust-part-1/">[...]</a>

The walking mode will be used for operations that are not ideal for wheels such as scaling a vertical wall or traversing over extremely uneven terrain. The rover mode is used for flat terrain and faster traveling time. The robot is controlled wirelessly via Wifi through a web page that I made exclusively for this robot. Beside the transforming capabilities, I also added an IMU sensors, GPS, and Lidar for self-orientation and autonomous functionality. In this project, the Arduino 101 is used as the muscle control cortex. The Arduino 101 do calculation and control all the servo on the robot and transmit and share this data with the Raspberry Pi 2. The Rapsberry Pi 2 on the other hand will focus on transmitting video to the webpages and broadcast sensor data to the cloud for analyzing. All the data is logged via IBM Watson and Node Red services and can be easily review in graph format for data analytics.The goal of this project is to create a low-cost multi-terrain traversing robot prototype for search and rescue operation."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/kurst811/wolf-search-and-rescue-multi-terrain-robot-7fed9c">[...]</a>

We vowed not only to never touch an IR receiver again, but also to do better next time. Thus, Bessie's son was born. His name is Eisseb (see what we did there). Eisseb is our obstacle avoiding car. He began as a fancy RC car chassis, and with some modifications, plus an arduino uno and a sonic sensor, he became what he is today: awesome. BUT WAIT!

We were able to crack our Craigslist safe in 40 minutes and 42 seconds! You can re-watch the live cracking if you’d like. The magic moment occurs at 45:20 but start around 44:30 to get the full scope of what’s going on. Brute force robots for combination safes are not new. They are sometimes called an “Autodialer”. And the robots that use audio feedback are sometimes called “SoftDrill”. The SparkFun Safe Cracker is a variant of the Autodialer. Instead of attempting every combination in the solution domain (called brute forcing) we use some tricks to reduce the domain and shortcuts to speed up the testing process. In addition, the SparkFun Safe Cracker is cheap (~$200), magnetically adheres to the safe, and is non-destructive; when we’re done you’ll never know we were there."</em> <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/building-a-safe-cracking-robot">[...]</a>
