<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia a 1911, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polykarp_Kusch">Polykarp Kusch</a>. Este físico Germano-Americano, foi responsável pela determinação de que do momento magnético do electrão é maior que o seu valor teórico, levando assim a inovações no campo da electrodinâmica quântica.
Esta semana foi apresentado um concorrente do Raspberry Pi - o Asus Tinker Board. Trata-se de uma placa muito semelhante em termos de formato com o Raspberry Pi, sendo que tem um Arm Cortex A17 com 4 cores a correr a 1.8GHz, ARM Mali-T764 GPU, e 2GB de memória DDR3. Esta geração de ARM apenas corre instruções de 32 bits ao contrario do Raspberry Pi 3, no entanto a GPU é superior à do Raspberry PI. Tem também interface Ethernet a Gigabit e Wifi com possibilidade de ligação de antenas exteriores.
A Samsung finalmente apresentou os resultados de um estudo que efectuou para determinar qual o problema que levava a que os Galaxy Note7 se incendiassem e que levou a que tivesse que fazer uma recolha massiva dos equipamentos com prejuízos de largos milhoes de euros. As conclusões apontam para deficiencias na construção e isolamento das baterias que equipavam estes equipamentos.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como alguns modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis. É apresentado também um livro sobre gestão do ciclo de vida de aplicações em contentores Docker com ferramentas Microsoft. Saiu a revista MagPI 54.</p>

<p><em>"Tech giant Asus is taking on the Raspberry Pi with its own DIY-friendly single-board computer that's said to offer 4K video playback and 24-bit audio support in exchange for a hefty £55 price tag. Dubbed the "Asus 90MB0QY1-M0EAY0 Tinker Board," or (thankfully) the "Tinker Board" for short, the 8.5cm by 5.3cm computer features a quad-core Arm Cortex A17 CPU running at 1.8GHz, ARM Mali-T764 GPU, and 2GB of DDR3 memory. The most recent revision of the Raspberry Pi, the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, sports a 64-bit Cortex A53 quad-core processor. The A17 in the Tinker Board only supports 32-bit instructions. However, the Mali-T764 GPU inside the Tinker Board is more powerful than the Broadcom VideoCore IV inside the Pi 3. There's hardware support for H.265 4K decoding instead of just 1080p, and Asus claims it pulls in almost double the benchmark score in Geekbench, which should equate to better 3D performance. Other niceties include gigabit Ethernet, support for SDIO 3.0, and swappable antennas for the built-in 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi module. Both single-board computers are almost exactly the same size, and at first glance it appears that the GPIO pins and mounting holes are in the same positions, suggesting the Tinker Board wants to be a drop-in replacement for the Raspberry Pi."</em> <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/01/asus-tinker-board-price-specs-release-date/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Today, loading a web page on a big website usually involves a database query — to retrieve the latest contributions to a discussion you’re participating in, a list of news stories related to the one you’re reading, links targeted to your geographic location, or the like. But database queries are time consuming, so many websites store — or “cache” — the results of common queries on web servers for faster delivery. If a site user changes a value in the database, however, the cache needs to be updated, too. The complex task of analyzing a website’s code to identify which operations necessitate updates to which cached values generally falls to the web programmer. Missing one such operation can result in an unusable site. This week, at the Association for Computing Machinery’s Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages, researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory presented a new system that automatically handles caching of database queries for web applications written in the web-programming language Ur/Web."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/faster-websites-fewer-bugs-0120">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Phase transitions surround us—for instance, liquid water changes to ice when frozen and to steam when boiled. Now, researchers at the Carnegie Institution for Science* have discovered a new phenomenon of so-called metastability in a liquid phase. A metastable liquid is not quite stable. This state is common in supercooled liquids, which are liquids that cool below the freezing point without turning into a solid or a crystal. Now, scientists report the first experimental evidence of creating a metastable liquid directly by the opposite approach: melting a high-pressure solid crystal of the metal bismuth via a decompression process below its melting point.  The results, reported in the January 23, 2017, issue of Nature Communications, could be important for developing new materials and for understanding the dynamics of planetary interiors, such as earthquakes, because a metastable liquid could act as a lubricant strongly affecting the dynamics of the Earth’s interior."</em> <a href="https://carnegiescience.edu/news/melting-solid-below-freezing-point">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Scientists from the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M), CIEMAT (Center for Energy, Environmental and Technological Research), Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón, in collaboration with the firm BioDan Group, have presented a prototype for a 3D bioprinter that can create totally functional human skin. This skin is adequate for transplanting to patients or for use in research or the testing of cosmetic, chemical, and pharmaceutical products. This research has recently been published in the electronic version of the scientific journal Biofabrication. In this article, the team of researchers has demonstrated, for the first time, that, using the new 3D printing technology, it is possible to produce proper human skin. One of the authors, José Luis Jorcano, professor in UC3M’s department of Bioengineering and Aerospace Engineering and head of the Mixed Unit CIEMAT/UC3M in Biomedical Engineering, points out that this skin “can be transplanted to patients or used in business settings to test chemical products, cosmetics or pharmaceutical products in quantities and with timetables and prices that are compatible with these uses.”"</em> <a href="http://www.uc3m.es/ss/Satellite/UC3MInstitucional/en/Detalle/Comunicacion_C/1371227676752/1371215537949/Spanish_scientists_create_a_3D_bioprinter_to_print_human_skin">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"A Northwestern University team developed a new computational model that performs at human levels on a standard intelligence test. This work is an important step toward making artificial intelligence systems that see and understand the world as humans do. “The model performs in the 75th percentile for American adults, making it better than average,” said Northwestern Engineering’s Ken Forbus. “The problems that are hard for people are also hard for the model, providing additional evidence that its operation is capturing some important properties of human cognition.” The new computational model is built on CogSketch, an artificial intelligence platform previously developed in Forbus’ laboratory. The platform has the ability to solve visual problems and understand sketches in order to give immediate, interactive feedback. CogSketch also incorporates a computational model of analogy, based on Northwestern psychology professor Dedre Gentner’s structure-mapping theory. (Gentner received the 2016 David E. Rumelhart Prize for her work on this theory.)"</em> <a href="http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/news/articles/2017/01/making-ai-systems-see-the-world-as-humans-do.html">[...]</a></p>

The study by Derek Lovley and colleagues appears this week in mBio, the American Society of Microbiology’s premier journal. The researchers studied microbial nanowires, protein filaments that bacteria use naturally to make electrical connections with other microbes or minerals. As Lovley explains, “Microbial nanowires are a revolutionary electronic material with substantial advantages over man-made materials. Chemically synthesizing nanowires in the lab requires toxic chemicals, high temperatures and/or expensive metals. The energy requirements are enormous. By contrast, natural microbial nanowires can be mass-produced at room temperature from inexpensive renewable feedstocks in bioreactors with much lower energy inputs. And the final product is free of toxic components.” "</em> <a href="http://www.umass.edu/newsoffice/article/microbiologists-make-big-leap-developing-">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="https://phys.org/news/2017-01-carbon-nanotube-transistors-outperform-silicon.html">Researchers build carbon nanotube transistors that outperform those made with silicon</a></h2>

<p><em>"A team of researchers at Peking University has built a carbon nanotube-based working transistor and report that it outperformed larger transistors made with silicon. In their paper published in the journal Science, the team describes how they built the transistor, how it performed and the challenges that still remain before such transistors can be mass produced. Everyone in the computer business knows the limit to which silicon-based transistors can be made smaller is drawing ever closer, so many teams around the world are searching for a suitable replacement. One of the most promising candidates is carbon nanotubes—due to their unique properties, transistors based on them could be smaller, faster and more efficient. Unfortunately, the difficulty in growing carbon nanotubes and their sometimes persnickety nature means that a way to make them and mass produce them has not been found. In this new effort, the researchers report on a method of creating carbon nanotube transistors that are suitable for testing, but not mass production. To create the transistors, the researchers took a novel approach—instead of growing carbon nanotubes that had certain desired properties, they grew some and put them randomly on a silicon surface and then added electronics that would work with the properties they had—clearly not a strategy that would work for mass production, but one that allowed for building a carbon nanotube transistor that could be tested to see if it would verify theories about its performance. Realizing there would still be scaling problems using traditional electrodes, the researchers built a new kind by etching very tiny sheets of graphene. The result was a very tiny transistor, the team reports, capable of moving more current than a standard CMOS transistor using just half of the normal amount of voltage. It was also faster due to a much shorter switch delay, courtesy of the intrinsic delay of just 70 femtoseconds."</em> <a href="https://phys.org/news/2017-01-carbon-nanotube-transistors-outperform-silicon.html">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Enterprises are increasingly adopting containers. The enterprise is realizing the benefits of cost savings, solution to deployment problems, and DevOps and production operations improvements that containers provide. Over the last years, Microsoft has been rapidly releasing container innovations to the Windows and Linux ecosystems – partnering with industry leaders like Docker and Mesosphere to deliver container solutions that help companies build and deploy applications at cloud speed and scale, whatever their choice of platform or tools. Building containerized applications in an enterprise environment means more than just developing and running applications in containers. It means that you need to have an end-to-end lifecycle so you are capable of delivering applications through Continuous Integration, Testing, Continuous Deployment to containers, and release management supporting multiple environments, while having solid production management and monitoring systems. Within the DevOps context, containers enable continuity in the CI/CD model as they create a clear boundary between developers by providing containerized apps with all the required environment configuration, and ITOps that builds a generic environment to run app specific content. This is all enabled through Microsoft tools and services for containerized Docker applications."</em> [[...]](http://download.microsoft.com/download/7/6/8/768E8E11-1C4B-4C5C-9211-96918C324722/Containerized%20Docker%20Application%20Lifecycle%20with%20Microsoft%20Platform%20and%20Tools%20(eBook)</p>

<p><em>"In electronics, a device is said to be a latching device if it maintains any particular fixed state even after removal of the input signal. The same also applies for electronic/electromechanical relays. Basically the electromechanical relays that are used today are of two types: 1. Non-Latching Relay : These relays are most widely used where energy consumption is basically not an issue.This type relay(s) comes back to its original state once the input signal is removed; 2. Latching Relay : These relays are mostly used in automobiles and are rarely used for basic prototyping needs. Most of the relays which we use today are monostable relays, that means it has only one stable state and so it is called non-latching relays. You must have heard about N.O (Normally Open) and N.C (Normally Closed) terminals of a basic electromechanical relay. However these terminals which are present over the relay show that the electronic relay which we are using has only one stable state."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Latching-Relay-Module/">[...]</a></p>

As @ch00ftech suggested, eliminating the search for the optimal QR mask and instead applying a fixed mask, drops the generation time to less than one second. Using a fast TFT display library by @Xark allows seconds to be displayed. This library was modified to comply with the calling convention for @seeedstudio libraries, making it a drop in replacement in an existing sketch. By changing a compiler directive, this library can also control an @adafruit LCD.

This task is based on Bouncerchallenge from the old TV game show Minute to Win It (although many people say it reminds them of beer pong).

Background: I was intrigued by IBM Watson beating Jeopardy champion Ken Jenkins a few years ago. So, while we have robots fighting robots and robots, and interacting with people in some way, I didn't see many robots challenging humans in physical skill games. This motivated a robot to challenge human competitors in a physical skill game (bouncing ping-pong balls). Findings: I'll summarize robot vs. human game outcomes from two Maker Faires in this Instructable, and share some "lessons learned." Technical overview: The robot operates using an Arduino UNO, two servos, a gear motor, and hall effect, optical, and mechanical sensors. An OLED display reports race results. See System Overview and General Operation for details. Also, because this project evolved over time, I'll share some "lessons learned." Project difficulty: Good electrical and mechanical construction skills, along with Arduino IDE experience is required.

For this project I decided to use a wooden base with an Arduino and a figure printed in 3D. First the bases were cut. Due to the low height of the wood it was necessary to cut two pieces, prepare them and to glue it. Two circles were cut into pine wood with approximately 14 cm in diameter, each. The first was cut with a jigsaw, but due to the fact that this was a time consuming process, I decided to cut the second on the table saw and end up with the belt sander. After that, it was necessary to perfect both in order to be without imperfections. The bases were glued with wood glue, clamped and dried for 24 hours. After that time, the sides of both parts were aligned with a router with a flush trim bit. This bit allows you to level out a part using the bearing area as guide. Next, it was necessary to create the cavity to house the electronics and the socket for the figure. To create these cavities was used, again, the router with a straight bit.

<p><em>"One major issue when dealing with sprinkler controllers is rain starting to pour during sequences execution, because in this case it is useless – if not damaging – to water a garden or plants while nature is already taking care of that; not to mention that pouring additional water on soil that has already been hit by pouring rain may lead to collapse of drainage canals or ditches, manholes or catch basins, besides causing garden or courtyard floods. Another issue is water stagnation once the rain stops pouring, because this is another instance where garden watering is of no use, since there already is a surplus of water. In order to bypass said obstacles, a sprinkler controller worthy of its name must include a sensor capable of detecting pouring rain and water on the ground beside being obviously able to handle signal coming from said sensor and consequently stop or delay execution of irrigation sequences; this latter aspect is assigned to programming and is currently taken into account in sprinkler controllers, which have a dedicated input, typically a clean-contact or resistive input with pull-up. Once input is activated, the controller executes expected action, skipping the cycle or just putting it on hold for a period of time believed to be sufficient (e.g. a couple of hours) for water to run out; said period of time must start from sensor deactivation, that is when water presence is no longer detected."</em> <a href="http://www.open-electronics.org/an-open-source-rain-sensor-and-controller/">[...]</a></p>

Most steel manufacturers specify particular temperatures to temper steel at so you can achieve a given hardness rating.

<p><em>"There is one thing missing from all my projects so far…..Something that moves. Bristle bots are very similar to hex bugs but are built from toothbrush heads and pager motors. I thought the idea of bristle bots was cool but they were no brains to them until i seen this blog post where you could control one with a light. Essentially this light following bristle bot is just two bristle bots side by side so it would be steered. Lets have a look at the hardware side of the build. Here is a bread board layout below. As you can see its just 2 bristle bots where the pager motor is controlled by a 2N7000 transistor which its speed is determined by the LDR (Light Dependent Resistors) and adjusted with a resistor trim pot. I also added a led to each one to show which pager motor is being activated, This makes it easier to see whats going on too."</em> <a href="https://facelesstech.wordpress.com/2016/08/15/light-following-bristle-bot/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"I've seen a lot of tutorials on how to automate manual shades and blinds, well in this one we'll automate electric shades. We'll cover electric shades ran by continuous current (DC) electric motors that open or close by reversing the polarity of the current. Although if you buy electric shades you'll get some automation there are reason for doing the automation on your own like: * you may have only a switch near them for up/down control; * it's cheaper (some companies offer advanced automation for a lot of extra $$); * even cheaper if you buy the electric shades kit from ebay and assemble them your self (a single shade kit is around 50$); * more flexible, you can program them do open or close on various circumstances, we'll learn about making a webserver in python that will connect to the shades bluetooth interface, and expose an API to control the shades, we'll also be integrating it with thingspeak and there you could do things like control the shades on a time schedule or control it via sensor input. This will be an intermediate tutorial, you'll need skills like soldering, arduino programming, basic electronic understanding, and some how to install services on a server, running and configuring them."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Automated-Windows-Shades/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"This entry is about the quest to get a machine to juggle a ping pong ball. I started thinking about a ping pong ball juggler 2 years ago. And it was around that time that I built the first one of them. it uses LED - Photo transistor pairs to "see" when and approximately where the ball comes down. I used 4 micro servos to move a wooden plate.  It's the machine in the first YouTube video. The next major update came when I decided it might be interesting to try to track the balls position by using the noise the ball makes when it hits the plate. I installed 4 mics and switched a FlipFlop on as soon as the sound level got over some threshold. The FlipFlop's value then gets read by a micro controller as fast as possible to then compute the time difference between the sound waves hitting the mic on the left in comparison to the mic on the right. The same goes for the front and back mics. This way 2 dimensional data about the ball position is gathered. It worked quite well. The machine on this stage is the one in the second YouTube video."</em> <a href="http://www.robotshop.com/letsmakerobots/node/51318">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Every year the Christmas Eve Santa Claus sets out on a journey travels around the globe and sends out presents to all the children around the world. But would it be cool to know where the Santa Claus is at that day? MKR1000 Santa Tracker to the rescue! You may already know there are two places where we can get Santa location information, one is from NORAD and one from Google. Although NORAD was the original organization who started the Santa tracking tradition, but Google provides a developer friendly (undocumented) API for the Santa tracking. With this API you will be able to track the real time Santa information including the location, arrival and departure time, presents sent at the location, the same as on the Google's Santa tracking web site. So in this project I chose to use Google Santa data to implement my Santa tracker."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/user127218626/iot-santa-tracker-on-colorful-world-map-095fe3">[...]</a></p>
