<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1862, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_and_Louis_Lumi%C3%A8re">Auguste Lumière</a>. Nascido em Besançon na França este inventor juntamente com o seu irmão Louis foram os primeiros cineastas da história. Eles patentearam um cinematógrafo melhorado, que em contraste com o kinetoscope de "Peepshow" de Thomas Edison permitia a exibição simultânea para várias pessoas.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1872, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_E._Brandenberger">Jacques E. Brandenberger</a>. Este químico suíço ficou conhecido na história por ter inventado o papel celofane.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1909, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marguerite_Perey">Marguerite Perey</a>. É atribuída a esta química francesa a descoberta do último elemento químico descoberto na natureza antes de ser sintetizado - o frâncio. Trabalhando como assistente de Marie Curie, Perey concentrou-se no actínio por muitos anos porque foi considerada uma possível fonte de franco por enfraquecimento. No entanto, a purificação necessária de actínio e concentração exigiu dezenas de procedimentos difíceis e cuidadosos. Depois de enviar uma tese sobre seu trabalho no elemento 87, em 1946, ela obteve um diploma de doutorado em física.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1910, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subrahmanyan_Chandrasekhar">Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar</a>. Este astrónomo e astrofísico norte-americano de origem indiana ficou conhecido por ser um dos primeiros cientistas a combinar as disciplinas da física e da astronomia. Foi ele conjuntamente com  William A.Fowler que formularam a teoria actualmente aceita nos estágios evolutivos posteriores de estrelas massivas (o que levou à descoberta de buracos negros e estrelas de neutrões). Esta mereceu o prémio Nobel da física em 1983. No início de sua carreira, ele demonstrou que há um limite superior, agora chamado de limite Chandrasekhar, para a massa de uma estrela anã branca. (Uma anã branca é a última etapa da evolução de uma estrela como o Sol, que termina com o colapso quando a fonte de energia nuclear no seu centro se esgotou). Além disso, mostra que as estrelas muito mais massivas do que o Sol devem ser explodir ou formar buracos negros.</p>

<p>Na semana que passou ficámos a saber que a primeira fábrica de emissões negativas de dióxido de carbono começou a operar. Produzimos 40 mil milhões de kg de dióxido de carbono a cada ano, e estamos no caminho para ultrapassar um limiar de emissões crucial que causará aumento de temperatura global para passar o perigoso limite de 2°C estabelecido pelo acordo climático de Paris. Mas os cientistas do clima já estão a falar sobre uma tecnologia que poderia nos afastar do abismo. É chamado de captura de ar directo, e consiste em máquinas que funcionam como uma árvore, sugando dióxido de carbono (CO2) para fora do ar, mas em esteróides - capturando milhares de vezes mais carbono na mesma quantidade de tempo contribuindo para nos afastarmos da catástrofe climática. A 11 de Outubro, numa fábrica de energia geotérmica na Islândia, foi inaugurado o primeiro sistema que faz a captura directa de ar e atinge de forma verificada emissões negativas de carbono. Embora ainda esteja numa escala piloto - capturar apenas 50 toneladas métricas de CO2 do ar a cada ano - o mesmo emitido por uma única casa dos EUA ou 10 famílias indianas - é o primeiro sistema a converter as emissões em pedra, garantindo assim que não irão fugir para a atmosfera nos próximos milhões de anos.</p>

<p>Também esta semana a Western Digital apresentou a próxima geração de tecnologia que irá assegurar a preservação e o acesso ao armazenamento necessário para tecnologias como o Big Data. Esta assenta numa inovação revolucionária para a produção de unidades de disco rígido de alta capacidade (HDDs) para atender às futuras necessidades do Big Data com confiabilidade comprovada de nível de data center. O evento, realizado na sede da empresa em Silicon Valey, incluiu uma demonstração do primeiro HDD de gravação magnética assistida por microondas (MAMR). O inventor da tecnologia MAMR, o professor Jimmy Zhu da Universidade Carnegie Mellon esteve presente no evento. A empresa também apresentou avanços na tecnologia de micro atuação e cabeça de gravação Damascene. A Western Digital espera começar a usar HDDs MAMR de alta capacidade em 2019 para uso em centros de dados que suportam aplicações Big Data.</p>

<p>Esta semana também, uma equipa de astrónomos, detectou a colisão de duas estrelas de neutrões usando ondas gravitacionais e luz. A descoberta inaugura uma nova era emocionante em astronomia - astronomia com ondas gravitacionais - menos de dois anos após a primeira detecção de ondas gravitacionais abrir uma nova janela no universo.</p>

<p>Por fim, foi lançada hoje mais uma versão do sistema Ubuntu - 17.10 - "Artful Aardvark". A Canonical anunciou hoje o lançamento deste novo sistema com um novo sistema de gestão de janelas GNOME com Wayland e novas versões do KDE, MATE e Budgie para responder a uma ampla gama de gostos. Na cloud, esta versão traz o Kubernetes 1.8 para operações de contentores hiper-elásticos e imagens de base mínimas para contentores. Este é o 27º lançamento do Ubuntu, o Linux mais utilizado no mundo, e constitui a linha de base para os recursos no próximo lançamento de classe empresarial de suporte a longo prazo em Abril de 2018.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como um modelo 3D que poderá ser útil. São apresentados os livros "An Introduction To Statistical Learning With Applications In R" e "Linux Appliance Design".</p>

<p><em>"There’s a colorless, odorless, and largely benign gas that humanity just can’t get enough of. We produce 40 trillion kg of carbon dioxide each year, and we’re on track to cross a crucial emissions threshold that will cause global temperature rise to pass the dangerous 2°C limit set by the Paris climate agreement. But, in hushed tones, climate scientists are already talking about a technology that could pull us back from the brink. It’s called direct-air capture, and it consists of machines that work like a tree does, sucking carbon dioxide (CO2) out from the air, but on steroids—capturing thousands of times more carbon in the same amount of time, and, hopefully, ensuring we don’t suffer climate catastrophe. There are at least two reasons that, to date, conversations about direct air capture have been muted. First, climate scientists have hoped global carbon emissions would come under control, and we wouldn’t need direct air capture."</em> <a href="https://qz.com/1100221/the-worlds-first-negative-emissions-plant-has-opened-in-iceland-turning-carbon-dioxide-into-stone/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2017/october/astronomers-make-historic-observation/">In historic observation, astronomers detect colliding neutron stars for the first time</a></h2>

<p><em>" An international research collaboration, including four Northwestern University astronomers, is the first to detect the spectacular collision of two neutron stars using both gravitational waves and light. The discovery ushers in an exciting new era in astronomy — multi-messenger astronomy with gravitational waves — less than two years after the first detection of gravitational waves opened a new window onto the universe. Northwestern’s Vicky Kalogera, the leading astrophysicist in the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC), was one of six experts on a special panel at the National Science Foundation press conference announcing the news at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. Gravitational waves were directly detected for the first time Sept. 14, 2015, by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), confirming Einstein’s theory of general relativity. Following the discovery, the observatory’s architects were awarded the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. The historic discovery of colliding neutron stars — which happened the morning of Aug. 17 with the longest gravitational-wave signal detected to date and a short gamma ray burst signal — was made by thousands of scientists and engineers using the U.S.-based LIGO; the Europe-based Virgo gravitational wave detector; and some 70 ground- and space-based observatories, including NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope. Multimedia gallery: Explore Northwestern’s involvement in the discovery The neutron stars’ spiral death dance in a nearby galaxy, 130 million light-years from Earth, ended with an extremely violent and bright collision — powerful enough to forge gold, platinum, lead and other heavy elements."</em> <a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2017/october/astronomers-make-historic-observation/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The British entrepreneur says he wants to make ‘airline speeds on the ground’ a reality, while engineering experts cast doubt on the safety of the technology Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Group has invested an undisclosed amount in Hyperloop One, the frontrunner of a number of companies competing to bring Elon Musk’s futuristic vision of a magnetically-propelled high-speed transport system to life. The investment, which makes up part of an $85m fundraising announced in September, will see Hyperloop One changing adding the Virgin name to its branding. “This is an incredibly innovative and exciting new way to move people and things at airline speeds on the ground,” Branson said in a statement. “With Virgin Hyperloop One, passengers and cargo will be loaded into a pod, and accelerate gradually via electric propulsion through a low-pressure tube. The pod quickly lifts above the track using magnetic levitation and glides at airline speeds for long distances due to ultra-low aerodynamic drag. We’re incredibly excited about the technology behind Virgin Hyperloop One and the way it could transform passengers’ lives.” Josh Giegel, co-founder of Hyperloop One, said “the combination of our proven technology and Virgin’s expertise in transportation, operations, safety and passenger experience will accelerate the commercialisation phase of our company’s development."</em> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/12/richard-branson-virgin-group-invests-hyperloop-one">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Pieces weighing up to 100kg could make it to the surface, says expert, when out-of-control 8.5-tonne laboratory breaks apart in the atmosphere An 8.5-tonne Chinese space station has accelerated its out-of-control descent towards Earth and is expected to crash to the surface within a few months. The Tiangong-1 or “Heavenly Palace” lab was launched in 2011 and described as a “potent political symbol” of China, part of an ambitious scientific push to turn China into a space superpower. It was used for both manned and unmanned missions and visited by China’s first female astronaut, Liu Yang, in 2012. But in 2016, after months of speculation, Chinese officials confirmed they had lost control of the space station and it would crash to Earth in 2017 or 2018. China’s space agency has since notified the UN that it expects Tiangong-1 to come down between October 2017 and April 2018. Since then the station’s orbit has been steadily decaying."</em> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/oct/13/tiangong-1-chinese-space-station-will-crash-to-earth-within-months">[...]</a>

Shortly after 8:41 a.m. EDT on Aug. 17, NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope picked up a pulse of high-energy light from a powerful explosion, which was immediately reported to astronomers around the globe as a short gamma-ray burst. The scientists at the National Science Foundation’s Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) detected gravitational waves dubbed GW170817 from a pair of smashing stars tied to the gamma-ray burst, encouraging astronomers to look for the aftermath of the explosion.

<p><em>"Removing part of a kidney with minimally invasive robotic surgery rather than an entire kidney when operating for smaller tumors is often best for patients from a recovery and health standpoint, but many surgeons hesitate to do so because of the complexity of the robotic partial nephrectomy procedure. Investigators with the Vanderbilt Institute for Surgery and Engineering (VISE) hope to change that by developing an image guidance interface for robotic surgery systems. This will give doctors a three-dimensional map of subsurface tumors, delicate blood vessels and other structures before they make incisions, so that they can cut in exactly the right place. A Vanderbilt team led by a urologic surgeon and biomedical and mechanical engineers has received a four-year National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant to develop enhanced software that will create a “surgical GPS” system to provide intraoperative guidance to surgeons performing partial kidney removal with the da Vinci robotic surgery system. “It’s our goal to make minimally invasive partial nephrectomy the gold standard for how patients with appropriate kidney masses are cared for surgically, as clinical evidence shows it should be,” said S. Duke Herrell, M.D., professor of Urologic Surgery, Biomedical and Mechanical Engineering, and director of Minimally Invasive Urologic Surgery and Robotics. “This innovation has the potential to dramatically enhance long-term outcomes and quality of life for patients by preserving kidney function and saving lives by more accurately removing masses and reducing positive tumor margin rates.” According to National Cancer Institute statistics, an estimated 64,000 new kidney cancer cases will be diagnosed and more than 14,000 deaths will occur in the United States in 2017."</em> <a href="https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2017/10/12/team-developing-imaging-upgrade-for-robotic-surgery/">[...]</a>

Origami paper folding techniques in recent years have been at center of research efforts focused on finding practical engineering applications for the ancient art, with ideas ranging from deployable antennas to robotic arms. “Our work provides a means to predict computationally the real origami behavior of a design – something that up to now has not been easily done,” said Glaucio Paulino, a professor in the Georgia Tech School of Civil and Environmental Engineering. “With the new software, we can easily visualize and, most importantly, engineer the behavior of deployable, self-assembling, and adaptable origami systems.” The research, which was supported by the National Science Foundation and reported October 11th in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society A, involved building a computer model to simulate the interaction between the two facets of a folded sheet, including how easily and how far the folds would bend and how much the flat planes would deform during movement. Once all sections were connected together and digitally represented a piece of origami, the model could simulate how the structure would behave based on what type of material – from soft paper to hard plastic or metal – would be used to create the object. “This type of modeling was possible already using finite element analysis, but that is a time-consuming process that could take hours or days and provides a lot of unnecessary data,” said Ke Liu, a Georgia Tech graduate student who worked on the project."</em> <a href="http://www.rh.gatech.edu/news/597199/new-software-speeds-origami-structure-designs">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Superconducting Quantum Simulator Outperforms Conventional Computer and May Simulate Complex Biological Processes, such as Plant Metabolism Hurricanes, traffic jams, demographic development – to predict the effect of such events, computer simulations are required. Many processes in nature, however, are so complicated that conventional computers fail. Quantum simulators may solve this problem. One of the basic phenomena in nature is the interaction between light and matter in photosynthesis. Physicists of Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) have now made a big step towards quantum mechanics understanding of plant metabolism. This is reported in the Nature Communications journal."</em> <a href="https://www.kit.edu/kit/english/pi_2017_143_quantum-simulator-first-functioning-component.php">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/stick-peel-bounce-controlling-freezing-droplets-0911">Stick, peel, or bounce: Controlling a freezing droplet’s fate</a></h2>

<p><em>"When freezing droplets impact a surface, they generally either stick to it or bounce away. Controlling this response is crucial to many applications, including 3-D printing, the spraying of some surface coatings, and the prevention of ice formation on structures such as airplane wings, wind turbines, or power lines. Now, MIT researchers have found a surprising new twist to the mechanics involved when droplets come in contact with surfaces. While most research has focused on the hydrophobic properties of such surfaces, it turns out that their thermal properties are also crucially important — and provide an unexpected opportunity to “tune” those surfaces to meet the exact needs of a given application. The new results are presented today in the journal Nature Physics, in a report by MIT associate professor of mechanical engineering Kripa Varanasi, former postdoc Jolet de Ruiter, and postdoc Dan Soto. “We found something very interesting,” Varanasi explains."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/stick-peel-bounce-controlling-freezing-droplets-0911">[...]</a>
