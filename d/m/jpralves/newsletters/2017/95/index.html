<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1951, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigefumi_Mori">Shigefumi Mori</a>. Este matemático japonês é conhecido pelos seus trabalhos na geometria algébrica. Ele generalizou a abordagem clássica para a classificação de superfícies algébricas para a classificação de três duplas algébricas. A abordagem clássica utilizou o conceito de modelos mínimos de superfícies algébricas. Foi ele que descobriu que o conceito de modelos mínimos também pode ser aplicado a três duplas se permitimos algumas singularidades nelas.</p>

<p>Esta semana a SpaceX lançou o seu foguetão da plataforma onde a NASA lançou os foguetões das missões Apollo e foi um sucesso.
Foi lançado esta semana o Kernel do Linux 4.10. Este apresenta novidades no suporte de GPU virtuais, um novo sistema de analise de cache em sistemas NUMA, melhorias no sistema de <em>writeback</em>, um novo sistema híbrido de <em>pooling</em> para sistemas ARM e suporte para o novo sistema de <em>caching</em> da Intel - <em>Cache Allocation Technology</em>, entre outras melhorias.
O telescópio Spitzer da NASA mostrou que existe um sistema de sete planetas à volta de uma estrela dos quais três têm condições viáveis para a habitabilidade. Provavelmente todos os planetas têm agua em estado liquido. Este é um novo recorde no numero de planetas viáveis a volta de uma estrela.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como um modelo 3D que poderá ser útil.</p>

The discovery sets a new record for greatest number of habitable-zone planets found around a single star outside our solar system. All of these seven planets could have liquid water -- key to life as we know it -- under the right atmospheric conditions, but the chances are highest with the three in the habitable zone."</em> <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6756">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/efficient-power-converter-internet-of-things-0217">Researchers devise efficient power converter for internet of things</a></h2>

<p><em>"The “internet of things” is the idea that vehicles, appliances, civil structures, manufacturing equipment, and even livestock will soon have sensors that report information directly to networked servers, aiding with maintenance and the coordination of tasks. Those sensors will have to operate at very low powers, in order to extend battery life for months or make do with energy harvested from the environment. But that means that they’ll need to draw a wide range of electrical currents. A sensor might, for instance, wake up every so often, take a measurement, and perform a small calculation to see whether that measurement crosses some threshold. Those operations require relatively little current, but occasionally, the sensor might need to transmit an alert to a distant radio receiver. That requires much larger currents. Generally, power converters, which take an input voltage and convert it to a steady output voltage, are efficient only within a narrow range of currents. But at the International Solid-State Circuits Conference last week, researchers from MIT’s Microsystems Technologies Laboratories (MTL) presented a new power converter that maintains its efficiency at currents ranging from 500 picoamps to 1 milliamp, a span that encompasses a 2,000,000-fold increase."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/efficient-power-converter-internet-of-things-0217">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="http://newscenter.sdsu.edu/sdsu_newscenter/news_story.aspx?sid=76593">Big Improvements to Brain-Computer Interface</a></h2>

<p><em>"When people suffer spinal cord injuries and lose mobility in their limbs, it’s a neural signal processing problem. The brain can still send clear electrical impulses and the limbs can still receive them, but the signal gets lost in the damaged spinal cord. The Center for Sensorimotor Neural Engineering (CSNE)—a collaboration of San Diego State University with the University of Washington (UW) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)—is working on an implantable brain chip that can record neural electrical signals and transmit them to receivers in the limb, bypassing the damage and restoring movement. Recently, these researchers described in a study published in the journal Nature Scientific Reports a critical improvement to the technology that could make it more durable, last longer in the body and transmit clearer, stronger signals. The technology, known as a brain-computer interface, records and transmits signals through electrodes, which are tiny pieces of material that read signals from brain chemicals known as neurotransmitters. By recording brain signals at the moment a person intends to make some movement, the interface learns the relevant electrical signal pattern and can transmit that pattern to the limb’s nerves, or even to a prosthetic limb, restoring mobility and motor function."</em> <a href="http://newscenter.sdsu.edu/sdsu_newscenter/news_story.aspx?sid=76593">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Gadgets are set to become flexible, highly efficient and much smaller, following a breakthrough in measuring two-dimensional ‘wonder’ materials by the University of Warwick. Dr Neil Wilson in the Department of Physics has developed a new technique to measure the electronic structures of stacks of two-dimensional materials – flat, atomically thin, highly conductive, and extremely strong materials – for the first time. Multiple stacked layers of 2D materials – known as heterostructures – create highly efficient optoelectronic devices with ultrafast electrical charge, which can be used in nano-circuits, and are stronger than materials used in traditional circuits. Various heterostructures have been created using different 2D materials – and stacking different combinations of 2D materials creates new materials with new properties."</em> <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/breakthrough_in_145wonder146/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"As the world shifts from fossil fuels, additional sources of energy-on-demand will be needed to make up for lulls in wind or solar. A new way of extracting uranium from seawater could help even countries without uranium mines harness nuclear power in the post-carbon energy future. Trace amounts of uranium exist in seawater, but efforts to extract that critical ingredient for nuclear power have produced insufficient quantities to make it a viable source for those countries that lack uranium mines. A practical method for extracting that uranium, which produces higher quantities in less time, could help make nuclear power a viable part of the quest for a carbon-free energy future."</em> <a href="http://news.stanford.edu/press-releases/2017/02/17/uranium-seawaterrs-nuclear-power/">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="http://dragaosemchama.com.br/2017/01/rex/">Getting the T-Rex Endless Runner to work on a Component Tester</a></h2>

<p><em>"Some time ago I got one of these transistor testers on eBay for around 10$. It is quite useful, specially because my multimeter does not measure capacitance or inductance.  I did a samll write up about it in portuguese here. First thing I noticed was the popular Atmega 328p on the back of the board. For some reason, I tried to calibrate it (there was no need) and messed up the values. Whatever was wrong, was inside the chip, specifically inside the chip’s eeprom. I found a way to read and program the chip, and then tried erasing the eeprom using avrdude, but could not get the measurements right. This made me think the board already comes calibrated from the seller. Because it was so easy to program the chip, I had decided that if I could not get it working I would just use it for anything else. I turns out I was just using a small capacitor when calibrating it, after using a capacitor of higher value than the recommended it worked just fine. Anyways, the atmega328p used on the board it is the same present in many duinos out there(UNO, Nano, Mini, a thousand clones.. etc), so it got me thinking “Why something so hackable is not being hacked?”. I mean, it has an LCD screen, a sort of button, battery connection, and a SPI port available."</em> <a href="http://dragaosemchama.com.br/2017/01/rex/">[...]</a></p>

The 74HC4511 accepts as inputs a 4 bit binary encoded decimal value. This value is interpreted as a single digit, and the 74HC4511 converts this value to provide output to the seven individual segments to display the digit. The C code demonstrates how to interact with the MCP23017 using the MRAA I2C interface. This interaction is composed of two bytes, with each byte driving the two general purpose IO groups. Each byte is composed of eight bits - two four bit groups. Each four bit group represents a digit to the 74HC4511. The C code further demonstrates the use of structures - to contain the four digit values, and for each, a flag indicating whether to enable the specific seven segment display, or blank it out all together.
