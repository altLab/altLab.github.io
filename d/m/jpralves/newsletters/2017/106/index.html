Este investigador Holandês formou-se em física teórica, tendo, no entanto, os seus contributos ficado na historia pelos seus algoritmos no campo da informática. O famoso algoritmo de Dijkstra - algoritmo para encontrar o caminho mais curto entre dois pontos. Foram igualmente muito importantes os seus contributos para o desenvolvimento de algoritmos de grafos, concorrência e distribuídos. Conjuntamente com o seu colega Jaap Zonneveld desenvolveram a linguagem de programação ALGOL 60. Trata-se de uma linguagem de programação que introduziu novos conceitos que posteriormente foram usados em linguagem mais modernas como o Pascal ou o C.
Também faz hoje anos que nascia em 1918 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman">Richard Feynman</a>. Este fisico teorico norte-americano ficou conhecido pelo seu trabalho na formulação integral do caminho da mecânica quântica, a teoria da electrodinâmica quântica e a física da super-fluidez do hélio líquido super-arrefecido, bem como na física de partículas para a qual propôs o modelo de "parton". Ficou também conhecido por ter participado no Projeto Manhattan.
Faz hoje anos, também <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Jarvik">Robert Jarvik</a>. Este cientista norte-americano, nascido em 1946 ficou conhecido por ter desenvolvido o primeiro coração artificial - o Jarvik-7.
Faz também anos hoje, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n">Theodore von Kármán</a>. Este engenheiro aeroespacial nascido na Hungria em 1881 ficou conhecido pelos seus trabalhos na área da aeronáutica e é responsável por muitos avanços chave na aerodinâmica, nomeadamente o seu trabalho sobre a caracterização do fluxo aéreo supersónico e hipersónico. Teve um papel preponderante no desenvolvimento do avião Bell X-1. Conhecido por ter sido o primeiro avião/veiculo pilotado a ultrapassar a velocidade do som em 1947. Este foi pilotado pelo Chuck Yeager.</p>

<p>Esta semana ficámos a saber que a Tesla vai finalmente comercializar o seu sistema de telhados solares. Trata-se de um sistema em que são as próprias telhas que são painéis solares. A NVidia apresentou a plataforma de GPU VOLTA. Trata-se de um sistema de alto desempenho que trará uma extraordinária velocidade e escalabilidade para inferência e treino de IA, bem como para acelerar HPC e cargas de trabalho de gráficos.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como alguns modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis. É apresentado também um livro sobre o desenho de placas de circuito impresso e a revista newelectronics de 9 de Maio.</p>

<p><em>"NVIDIA today launched Volta™ -- the world's most powerful GPU computing architecture, created to drive the next wave of advancement in artificial intelligence and high performance computing. The company also announced its first Volta-based processor, the NVIDIA® Tesla® V100 data center GPU, which brings extraordinary speed and scalability for AI inferencing and training, as well as for accelerating HPC and graphics workloads. "Artificial intelligence is driving the greatest technology advances in human history," said Jensen Huang, founder and chief executive officer of NVIDIA, who unveiled Volta at his GTC keynote. "It will automate intelligence and spur a wave of social progress unmatched since the industrial revolution. "Deep learning, a groundbreaking AI approach that creates computer software that learns, has insatiable demand for processing power. Thousands of NVIDIA engineers spent over three years crafting Volta to help meet this need, enabling the industry to realize AI's life-changing potential," he said. Volta, NVIDIA's seventh-generation GPU architecture, is built with 21 billion transistors and delivers the equivalent performance of 100 CPUs for deep learning. It provides a 5x improvement over Pascal™, the current-generation NVIDIA GPU architecture, in peak teraflops, and 15x over the Maxwell™ architecture, launched two years ago. This performance surpasses by 4x the improvements that Moore's law would have predicted."</em> <a href="http://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-launches-revolutionary-volta-gpu-platform-fueling-next-era-of-ai-and-high-performance-computing">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.thedonnellycentre.utoronto.ca/news/deep-learning-helps-scientists-keep-track-cell%E2%80%99s-inner-parts">Deep Learning Helps Scientists Keep Track of Cell’s Inner Parts</a></h2>

<p><em>"Donnelly Centre researchers have developed a deep learning algorithm that can track proteins, to help reveal what makes cells healthy and what goes wrong in disease. “We can learn so much by looking at images of cells: how does the protein look under normal conditions and do they look different in cells that carry genetic mutations or when we expose cells to drugs or other chemical reagents? People have tried to manually assess what’s going on with their data but that takes a lot of time,” says Benjamin Grys, a graduate student in molecular genetics and a co-author on the study. Dubbed DeepLoc, the algorithm can recognize patterns in the cell made by proteins better and much faster than the human eye or previous computer vision-based approaches. In the cover story of the latest issue of Molecular Systems Biology, teams led by Professors Brenda Andrews and Charles Boone of the Donnelly Centre and the Department of Molecular Genetics, also describe DeepLoc’s ability to process images from other labs, illustrating its potential for wider use. From self-driving cars to computers that can diagnose cancer, artificial intelligence (AI) is shaping the world in ways that are hard to predict, but for cell biologists, the change could not come soon enough. Thanks to new and fully automated microscopes, scientists can collect reams of data faster than they can analyze it."</em> <a href="http://www.thedonnellycentre.utoronto.ca/news/deep-learning-helps-scientists-keep-track-cell%E2%80%99s-inner-parts">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scientists at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) have developed a holographic imaging process that depicts the radiation of a Wi-Fi transmitter to generate three-dimensional images of the surrounding environment. Industrial facility operators could use this to track objects as they move through the production hall. Just like peering through a window, holograms project a seemingly three-dimensional image. While optical holograms require elaborate laser technology, generating holograms with the microwave radiation of a Wi-Fi transmitter requires merely one fixed and one movable antenna, as Dr. Friedenmann Reinhard and Philipp Holl report in the current issue of the renowned scientific journal Physical Review Letters. “Using this technology, we can generate a three-dimensional image of the space around the Wi-Fi transmitter, as if our eyes could see microwave radiation,” says Friedemann Reinhard, director of the Emmy Noether Research Group for Quantum Sensors at the Walter Schottky Institute of the TU Munich. The researchers envision fields of deployment especially in the domain of industry 4.0 – automated industrial facilities, in which localizing parts and devices is often difficult."</em> <a href="https://www.tum.de/en/about-tum/news/press-releases/detail/article/33897/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.buffalo.edu/news/releases/2017/04/051.html">“Valleytronics” advancement could help extend Moore’s Law</a></h2>

<p><em>"In the world of semiconductor physics, the goal is to devise more efficient and microscopic ways to control and keep track of 0 and 1, the binary codes that all information storage and logic functions in computers are based on. A new field of physics seeking such advancements is called valleytronics, which exploits the electron’s “valley degree of freedom” for data storage and logic applications. Simply put, valleys are maxima and minima of electron energies in a crystalline solid. A method to control electrons in different valleys could yield new, super-efficient computer chips. A University at Buffalo team, led by Hao Zeng, PhD, professor in the Department of Physics, worked with scientists around the world to discover a new way to split the energy levels between the valleys in a two-dimensional semiconductor. The work is described in a study published online today (May 1, 2017) in the journal Nature Nanotechnology. The key to Zeng’s discovery is the use of a ferromagnetic compound to pull the valleys apart and keep them at different energy levels. This leads to an increase in the separation of valley energies by a factor of 10 more than the one obtained by applying an external magnetic field."</em> <a href="http://www.buffalo.edu/news/releases/2017/04/051.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"What looks like a tiny mechanical ostrich chasing after a car is actually a significant leap forward for robot-kind. The clever and simple two-legged robot, known as the Planar Elliptical Runner, was developed at the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition in Pensacola, Florida, to explore how mechanical design can be used to enable sophisticated legged locomotion. A video produced by the researchers shows the robot being tested in a number of situations, including on a treadmill and running behind and alongside a car with a helping hand from an engineer. In contrast to many other legged robots, this one doesn’t use sensors and a computer to help balance itself. Instead, its mechanical design provides dynamic stability as it runs. “All the intelligence is in the physical design of the robot itself,” says Jerry Pratt, a senior research scientist at IHMC who leads the team that developed the robot. Pratt's group at IHMC is working on a range of different robots. The design might feed into future systems. “We believe that the lessons learned from this robot can be applied to more practical running robots to make them more efficient and natural looking,” Pratt adds. “Running will be eventually useful for any application that you want to do quickly and where wheels can't work well.”"</em> <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/604308/an-ostrich-like-robot-pushes-the-limits-of-legged-locomotion/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2017/may/touchpads-with-spray-paint.html">CMU Creating touchpads with can of spray paint</a></h2>

<p><em>"Touch sensing is most common on small, flat surfaces such as smartphone or tablet screens. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, however, turn surfaces of a wide variety of shapes and sizes into touchpads using tools as simple as a can of spray paint. Walls, furniture, steering wheels, toys and even Jell-O can be turned into touch sensors with the technology, dubbed Electrick. The "trick" is to apply electrically conductive coatings or materials to objects or surfaces or to craft objects using conductive materials. By attaching a series of electrodes to the conductive materials, researchers showed they could use a well-known technique called electric field tomography to sense the position of a finger touch. "For the first time, we've been able to take a can of spray paint and put a touch screen on almost anything," said Chris Harrison, assistant professor in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII) and head of the Future Interfaces Group. The group will present Electrick at CHI 2017, the Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, this week in Denver, Colo. Until now, large touch surfaces have been expensive and irregularly shaped or flexible touch surfaces have been largely available only in research labs. Some methods have relied on computer vision, which can be disrupted if a camera's view of a surface is blocked. The presence of cameras also raises privacy concerns."</em> <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2017/may/touchpads-with-spray-paint.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://phys.org/news/2017-05-smart-devices-space.html">Operating smart devices from the space on and above the back of your hand</a></h2>

<p><em>"It relies on a depth sensor that tracks movements of the thumb and index finger on and above the back of the hand. In this way, not only can smartwatches be controlled, but also smartphones, smart TVs and devices for augmented and virtual reality. They're called the "Apple Watch Series 2", "LG Watch", "Samsung GEAR S3" or "Moto 360 2nd Gen" but they all have the same problem. "Every new product generation has better screens, better processors, better cameras, and new sensors, but regarding input, the limitations remain," explains Srinath Sridhar, a researcher in the Graphics, Vision and Video group at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics. Together with Christian Theobalt, head of the Graphics, Vision and Video group at MPI, Anders Markussen and Sebastian Boring at the University of Copenhagen and Antti Oulasvirta at Aalto University in Finland, Srinath Sridhar has therefore developed an input method that requires only a small camera to track fingertips in mid-air, and touch and position of the fingers on the back of the hand. This combination enables more expressive interactions than any previous sensing technique. Regarding hardware, the prototype, which the researchers have named "WatchSense", requires only a depth sensor, a much smaller version of the well-known "Kinect" game controller from the Xbox 360 video game console. With WatchSense, the depth sensor is worn on the user's forearm, about 20cm from the watch. As a sort of 3D camera, it captures the movements of the thumb and index finger, not only on the back of the hand but also in the space over and above it. The software developed by the researchers recognizes the position and movement of the fingers within the 3D image, allowing the user to control apps on smartphones or other devices. "The currently available depth sensors do not fit inside a smartwatch, but from the trend it's clear that in the near future, smaller depth sensors will be integrated into smartwatches," Sridhar says."</em> <a href="https://phys.org/news/2017-05-smart-devices-space.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"When it comes to removing very dilute concentrations of pollutants from water, existing separation methods tend to be energy- and chemical-intensive. Now, a new method developed at MIT could provide a selective alternative for removing even extremely low levels of unwanted compounds. The new approach is described in the journal Energy and Environmental Science, in a paper by MIT postdoc Xiao Su, Ralph Landau Professor of Chemical Engineering T. Alan Hatton, and five others at MIT and at the Technical University of Darmstadt in Germany. The system uses a novel method, relying on an electrochemical process to selectively remove organic contaminants such as pesticides, chemical waste products, and pharmaceuticals, even when these are present in small yet dangerous concentrations. The approach also addresses key limitations of conventional electrochemical separation methods, such as acidity fluctuations and losses in performance that can happen as a result of competing surface reactions."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/electrochemical-clear-pollutants-water-0510">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/mit-csail-teaching-robots-to-teach-other-robots-0510">Teaching robots to teach other robots</a></h2>

<p><em>"Most robots are programmed using one of two methods: learning from demonstration, in which they watch a task being done and then replicate it, or via motion-planning techniques such as optimization or sampling, which require a programmer to explicitly specify a task’s goals and constraints. Both methods have drawbacks. Robots that learn from demonstration can’t easily transfer one skill they’ve learned to another situation and remain accurate. On the other hand, motion planning systems that use sampling or optimization can adapt to these changes but are time-consuming, since they usually have to be hand-coded by expert programmers. Researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) have recently developed a system that aims to bridge the two techniques: C-LEARN, which allows noncoders to teach robots a range of tasks simply by providing some information about how objects are typically manipulated and then showing the robot a single demo of the task. Importantly, this enables users to teach robots skills that can be automatically transferred to other robots that have different ways of moving — a key time- and cost-saving measure for companies that want a range of robots to perform similar actions."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/mit-csail-teaching-robots-to-teach-other-robots-0510">[...]</a>

<p><em>"What if the 450 nuclear power plants currently operating around the world could increase their energy output by 10 percent? It would represent a significant increase in carbon-free power production and the equivalent of billions of dollars in plant operation and construction cost savings. It's also the primary research goal of newly-appointed Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering (NSE) Assistant Professor Matteo Bucci. The output boost would be accomplished by using microtechnology and nanotechnology to re-engineer the outer surface of reactor fuel rods to prevent bubbles in cooling water from coalescing on the rods’ surface, where they form dry patches that lead to failure. This would ensure the efficient transfer of heat from rod to water under a wider range of conditions, which in turn would allow reactors to run at higher power and produce more electricity while preserving wide safety margins. “It’s a way of getting more juice from the same lemon,” explains Bucci, who began his affiliation with NSE as a visiting scientist in 2013. Bucci was named a research scientist in 2015, earned his faculty appointment in the fall of 2016 and has participated for several years in the MIT Center for Advanced Nuclear Energy Systems (CANES), which is hosting the research effort. In a show of strong industry interest, Bucci and his project teammate, Evelyn Wang, an associate professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, are being funded by energy giant Exelon. Fuel vendor Westinghouse Electric is also collaborating on the project. The corporate support (which also covers CANES research into several other improvements to fuel rod cladding) spans three years, and the technology could be ready for initial deployment within five years."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/mit-assistant-professor-matteo-bucci-using-nanotechnology-to-improve-nuclear-fuel-rods-0510">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Engineers are unveiling an upgrade to the transistor laser that could be used to boost computer processor speeds – the formation of two stable energy states and the ability to switch between them quickly. Modern computers are limited by a delay formed as electrons travel through the tiny wires and switches on a computer chip. To overcome this electronic backlog, engineers would like to develop a computer that transmits information using light, in addition to electricity, because light travels faster than electricity. Having two stable energy states, or bistability, within a transistor allows the device to form an optical-electric switch. That switch will work as the primary building block for development of optical logic – the language needed for future optical computer processors to communicate, said Milton Feng, the Nick Holonyak Jr. Emeritus Chair in electrical and computer engineering and the team lead in a recent study."</em> <a href="https://news.illinois.edu/blog/view/6367/498047">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Combining speed with incredible precision, a team of researchers has developed a way to print a nanoscale imaging probe onto the tip of a glass fiber as thin as a human hair, accelerating the production of the promising new device from several per month to several per day. The high-throughput fabrication technique opens the door for the widespread adoption of this and other nano-optical structures, which squeeze and manipulate light in ways that are unachievable by conventional optics. Nano-optics have the potential to be used for imaging, sensing, and spectroscopy, and could help scientists improve solar cells, design better drugs, and make faster semiconductors. A big obstacle to the technology’s commercial use, however, is its time-consuming production process. The new fabrication method, called fiber nanoimprinting, could unplug this bottleneck. It was developed by scientists at the Molecular Foundry, located at the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), in partnership with scientists from Hayward, California-based aBeam Technologies.

<p><em>"Researchers from UCLA and the University of Connecticut have designed a new biofriendly energy storage system called a biological supercapacitor, which operates using charged particles, or ions, from fluids in the human body. The device is harmless to the body’s biological systems, and it could lead to longer-lasting cardiac pacemakers and other implantable medical devices. The UCLA team was led by Richard Kaner, a distinguished professor of chemistry and biochemistry, and of materials science and engineering, and the Connecticut researchers were led by James Rusling, a professor of chemistry and cell biology. A paper about their design was published this week in the journal Advanced Energy Materials. Pacemakers — which help regulate abnormal heart rhythms — and other implantable devices have saved countless lives. But they’re powered by traditional batteries that eventually run out of power and must be replaced, meaning another painful surgery and the accompanying risk of infection. In addition, batteries contain toxic materials that could endanger the patient if they leak. The researchers propose storing energy in those devices without a battery. The supercapacitor they invented charges using electrolytes from biological fluids like blood serum and urine, and it would work with another device called an energy harvester, which converts heat and motion from the human body into electricity — in much the same way that self-winding watches are powered by the wearer’s body movements. That electricity is then captured by the supercapacitor."</em> <a href="http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/battery-free-implantable-medical-device-draws-energy-directly-from-human-body">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers from the University of Antwerp and KU Leuven have succeeded in developing a process that purifies air and, at the same time, generates power. The device must only be exposed to light in order to function. “We use a small device with two rooms separated by a membrane,” explains Professor Sammy Verbruggen (UAntwerp/KU Leuven). “Air is purified on one side, while on the other side hydrogen gas is produced from a part of the degradation products. This hydrogen gas can be stored and used later as fuel, as is already being done in some hydrogen buses, for example." In this way, the researchers respond to two major social needs: clean air and alternative energy production. The heart of the solution lies at the membrane level, where the researchers use specific nanomaterials. “These catalysts are capable of producing hydrogen gas and breaking down air pollution,” explains Professor Verbruggen. “In the past, these cells were mostly used to extract hydrogen from water. We have now discovered that this is also possible, and even more efficient, with polluted air.” It seems to be a complex process, but it is not: the device must only be exposed to light. The researchers’ goal is to be able to use sunlight, as the processes underlying the technology are similar to those found in solar panels. The difference here is that electricity is not generated directly, but rather that air is purified while the generated power is stored as hydrogen gas."</em> <a href="https://nieuws.kuleuven.be/en/content/2017/new-technology-generates-power-from-polluted-air">[...]</a>

The device, sensitive enough to feel a beating pulse, is made from soft, stretchy silicone that conforms to the curves of your fingertip. It's a step toward a more seamless integration of human and machine, said Michael McAlpine, a materials scientist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. His team didn't print the device on a real hand yet -- just an artificial one. "But," he said, "it sets the stage for future work in 3-D printing electronic devices directly on the body." Someday, that could mean technology evocative of the cyborgs and bionic humans of science fiction. In the nearer term, 3-D printed gadgets on and in the body could aid medical treatment, health monitoring and surgery. This 3-D printing approach, detailed today in the journal Advanced Materials, could produce gadgets without the cleanrooms and fancy equipment needed to make most devices today, McAlpine said. And as 3-D printers become cheaper and smaller, they might even become the Swiss army knives of the future."</em> <a href="https://www.insidescience.org/news/3-d-printing-way-bionic-humans">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Prescription drugs have enabled millions of Americans with chronic medical conditions to live longer and more fulfilling lives, but many promising new drugs never make it to the human trials stage due to the potential for cardiac toxicity. Through "heart-on-a-chip" technology -- modeling a human heart on an engineered chip and measuring the effects of compound exposure on functions of heart tissue using microelectrodes -- Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) researchers hope to decrease the time needed for new drug trials and ensure potentially lifesaving drugs are safe and effective while reducing the need for human and animal testing. The research is part of the Lab's iCHIP (in-vitro Chip-Based Human Investigational Platform) project, which replicates human systems on engineered platforms to test the effects of toxic chemical and biological compounds. The research, published online on April 18 in the journal Lab on a Chip (link is external), describes the successful recording of both electrical signals and cellular beating from normal human heart cells grown on a multi-electrode array developed at the Lab.

Once I have made this I will be able to control its color by lots of tools and devices. So Let's make this thing and get it connected to the internet (Internet of Things). To make vibrant colors I used 5050 RGB SMD LEDs for better color blending. So if you don't have it no worries, use normal 5mm RGB LEDs or separate R G B LEDs with proper diffuser, Even at my place its hard to find RGB SMD led so I savaged it from LED Strip.

With this in mind, sometime ago I built a kit for 3D priting that allowed me to do that and called it simply Modular Automata. This design consists on a set of independent boxes, each one able do execute a type of motion, linear along the x axis, linear along the z axis and rotational. You can print and combine several of these boxes and add signs to them for that extra bit of customization, finally you simply turn a small knob and that motion is transmitted through all boxes thus bringing your custom automata to life. That project was designed in my software of choice at the time, Rhinoceros, but more recently I've been dabbling in Fusion 360 and this project seemed a perfect fit for Fusion 360 due to it's parametric nature, while I do like Rhino, it's a pain to change part of a design, that same task in Fusion 360 usually does not require much more than right-clicking on the feature and changing the required value.

<p><em>"Supplying power to motors and LEDs is not always just a case of connecting to a battery and flicking a switch. Sometimes we need to control the speed of motors and be able to dim LEDs for a romantic mood effect, which is often achieved by pulsing the motor / LED with a voltage at a specific frequency (PWM). If we tried to run the motor directly off a PWM pin on an Arduino we would soon smell the tale-tale scent of burning silicon and maybe even see a small flame being emitted, which is obviously a bit of a fire hazard! The controller needs to not only pulse the motor windings with the Arduino, but also needs to bring current in from a fairly robust auxiliary power supply. This is achieved by using a set of 4 integrated circuits containing power transistors, resistors and diodes, all in contained within the four neat little packages. A manually controlled lighting system is great for setting moods, where you can get exactly the right lighting level for a romantic evening, but stepper motors have some seriously useful applications and to be able to control them manually, without using a computer, effectively gives you an incredible level of precision control, quite literally, at your finger tips. Some engineering and medical jobs need to be done on a high precision microscopic level. Maybe you want to accurately place miniature components on a circuit board or perform a high precision surgical operation or experiment with genetic engineering under an electron microscope? Some jobs are just too small and delicate to be done by hand without assistance from a machine. For example, this controller could move a surgeon's scalpel to 1/100 th of a mm accuracy (or better) using your fingers. But the best thing of all is that it's incredibly easy to build - A reasonably clever 12 year old would have no problems building this controller - perfect for any budding brain surgeon! There are no SMT components to solder, no complicated programming, no software drivers to drive you crazy - just a few cheap components, most importantly the STMicroelectronics L293E, and an Arduino Mega or Due. Just because this design is simple does not mean that it's not incredibly useful. It can be used to control a16 channel lighting system with a honking great 1A per channel - yes that's 16A total - and as a general purpose slider / rotary pot / toggle switch / push button Arduino interface and for precision control of stepper motors. So, the next time you go in for a frontal lobotomy, your surgeon may well be using one or two of these controllers and a couple of Arduinos to not only do the surgical operation but also to control the mood lighting for a nice relaxing environment!"</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Simple-Manual-Arduino-4-Axis-Stepper-Motor-16-Chan/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Around one and a half years ago I’ve designed and built various LED dimmers for both white and RGB LEDs.  Then late last year someone approached me asking if I could make an RGB dimmer for him, too. But my designs were really tailored to their specific applications and built with home-made, i.e. milled PCBs which are time-consuming to make. So I decided to make a more universal version based on a proper, etched board which could be built in a small series and used for all kind of applications, both white and RGB. The result is this versatile, programmable 4-channel dimmer."</em> <a href="https://soldernerd.com/2017/04/30/programmable-led-dimmer/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"If Apple made a car, would it have Windows? We don't know, but we know this Instructable is wheely cool! ;) Hello Guys! We are Mary and Rain, two students in Ms. Berbawy's Robotics class at Irvington High School. This Instructable is for our SIDE project in this class. In this project, we took a car built for the Science Olympiad Division C Electric Vehicle build event and modified it into an RC car that can be controlled via a phone application and take pictures/videos like a land drone. Although we also built the car ourselves and will show you the general steps of how it was done, this Instructable is more focused on the controller and electronics aspect, which we hope can be implemented to your own car designs (better than ours?). We hope you enjoy this Instructable and feel free to give any suggestions as it is our first Instructable! :)"</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Bluetooth-RC-Drone-Car/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Good lighting is an essential part of video production and photography. Unfortunately achieving this lighting isn't always easy or cheap, in the past I've used everything from orange tinted desk lamps to led flashlights to try and provide better lighting for my photos and videos. That's why I decided to make a portable white led panel which can be used indoor while connected to a wall adaptor or used outdoors with a battery pack that we are going to build. Overall this is a pretty easy build which can be done even if you're electronics experience is low."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Portable-Light-Panel/">[...]</a>
