<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia em 1749 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Laplace">Pierre-Simon Laplace</a>. A este estudioso francês são atribuídos diversos avanços nas áreas da matemática, estatística, física e astronomia. O seu trabalho permitiu que o estudo geométrico da mecânica clássica passasse a ser baseado no cálculo, criando as bases para uma gama mais ampla de problemas. Na estatística, a interpretação bayesiana da probabilidade foi desenvolvida principalmente por Laplace. Laplace formulou a equação de Laplace e foi pioneiro na transformada de Laplace que aparece associada a muitos ramos da física matemática, um campo onde ele assumiu um papel de liderança na formação. O operador diferencial laplaciano, amplamente utilizado em matemática, também é nomeado após ele. Ele reafirmou e desenvolveu a hipótese nebular da origem do Sistema Solar e foi um dos primeiros cientistas a postular a existência de buracos negros e a noção de colapso gravitacional.
Faz hoje anos também que nascia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton_Lorenz">Edward Norton Lorenz</a>. Este matemático norte-americano nascido em 1917 ficou conhecido pela teoria dos caos que enunciou relacionada com fenómenos atmosféricos. Nesta inclui-se o efeito borboleta onde pequenas causas podem ter grandes efeitos. Inicialmente, foi usado com a previsão do tempo, mas mais tarde o termo se tornou uma metáfora usada dentro e fora da ciência. É a este matemático também atribuído o atrator de Lorenz. Trata-se de um sistema de equações diferenciais ordinárias estudado pela primeira vez por este matemático. É notável por ter soluções caóticas para certos valores de parâmetros e condições iniciais. Em particular, o atrator Lorenz é um conjunto de soluções caóticas do sistema Lorenz que, quando desenhadas, se assemelham a uma borboleta ou figura oito.</p>

<p>Esta semana ficámos a saber que a NASA está a criar uma Internet espacial. Trata-se de um sistema de comunicações usando laser e que tem o potencial para revolucionar as comunicações espaciais.
Ficámos igualmente a sabe que uma equipa de cientistas conseguiu bater o recorde de eficiência de captação de energia solar. A Kaneka Corporation desenvolveu um painel solar de silício cristalino de alta eficiência de conversão. Conseguiram estabelecer o recorde de  26.33% num painel solar de silício cristalino com um tamanho prático (180 cm2).
Por fim, o telescopio Hubble detecta buraco negro supermassivo a grande distância do centro galáctico. O buraco negro foi ‘empurrado’ para fora do centro da galáxia 3C186, localizada a uma distância aproximada de oito mil milhões de anos-luz da Terra, provavelmente devido à energia exercida pela radiação gravitacional. As imagens da galáxia captadas pelo telescópio espacial Hubble, operado pela ESA, revelam um quasar brilhante, a assinatura da energia de um buraco negro activo, situado longe do núcleo da galáxia.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como alguns modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis. É apresentado também cinco livros, todos eles da Usborne sobre diversos temas relacionados com programação.</p>

<p><em>"NASA is developing a trailblazing, long-term technology demonstration of what could become the high-speed internet of the sky. The Laser Communications Relay Demonstration (LCRD) will help NASA understand the best ways to operate laser communications systems. They could enable much higher data rates for connections between spacecraft and Earth, such as scientific data downlink and astronaut communications. “LCRD is the next step in implementing NASA’s vision of using optical communications for both near-Earth and deep space missions,” said Steve Jurczyk, associate administrator of NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate, which leads the LCRD project. “This technology has the potential to revolutionize space communications, and we are excited to partner with the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate’s Space Communications and Navigation program office, MIT Lincoln Labs and the U.S. Air Force on this effort.”"</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/nasa-taking-first-steps-toward-high-speed-space-internet">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) using photovoltaic technologies is still high compared with other power generation methods, and cost reduction is a continuous challenge. A number of companies and research organizations around the world have been carrying out technological development to improve the conversion efficiency of solar cells, which will contribute to a considerable reduction in LCOE. Kaneka Corporation developed a high conversion-efficiency crystalline silicon solar cell (heterojunction back-contact type) in NEDO’s Development of High-Performance and Reliable PV Modules to Reduce LCOE project, and has achieved the world’s highest conversion efficiency of 26.33% in a crystalline silicon solar cell having a practical size (180 cm2).

<h2><a href="https://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1706/">Hubble detects supermassive black hole kicked out of galactic core</a></h2>

<p><em>"Though several other suspected runaway black holes have been seen elsewhere, none has so far been confirmed. Now astronomers using the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope have detected a supermassive black hole, with a mass of one billion times the Sun’s, being kicked out of its parent galaxy. “We estimate that it took the equivalent energy of 100 million supernovae exploding simultaneously to jettison the black hole,” describes Stefano Bianchi, co-author of the study, from the Roma Tre University, Italy. The images taken by Hubble provided the first clue that the galaxy, named 3C186, was unusual. The images of the galaxy, located 8 billion light-years away, revealed a bright quasar, the energetic signature of an active black hole, located far from the galactic core. “Black holes reside in the centres of galaxies, so it’s unusual to see a quasar not in the centre,” recalls team leader Marco Chiaberge, ESA-AURA researcher at the Space Telescope Science Institute, USA."</em> <a href="https://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1706/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"For five decades, Moore’s law held up pretty well: Roughly every two years, the number of transistors one could fit on a chip doubled, all while costs steadily declined. Today, however, transistors and other electronic components are so small they’re beginning to bump up against fundamental physical limits on their size. Moore’s law has reached its end, and it’s going to take something different to meet the need for computing that is ever faster, cheaper and more efficient. As it happens, Kwabena Boahen, a professor of bioengineering and of electrical engineering, has a pretty good idea what that something more is: brain-like, or neuromorphic, computers that are vastly more efficient than the conventional digital computers we’ve grown accustomed to. This is not a vision of the future, Boahen said. As he lays out in the latest issue of Computing in Science and Engineering, the future is now."</em> <a href="http://news.stanford.edu/2017/03/13/moores-law-ends-brain-like-computers-begin/">[...]</a></p>

But in the literature on multirobot systems, security has gotten relatively short shrift. In the latest issue of the journal Autonomous Robots, researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and their colleagues present a new technique for preventing malicious hackers from commandeering robot teams’ communication networks. The technique could provide an added layer of security in systems that encrypt communications, or an alternative in circumstances in which encryption is impractical."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/security-multirobot-systems-hackers-0317">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Since the advent of microelectronics in the mid-20th century, humanity has been on a nonstop sprint to eke more speed, power efficiency, and computational power from the sextillions (1021) of ever more miniaturized transistors that have come to underlie so much of the modern technoscape. Even so, the materials scientists, electrical engineers, and other specialists who are leading this decades-long advance know that astounding technological opportunities abound within both existing and yet-to-be-imagined semiconductor structures. When it comes to transistors that generate and receive radiofrequency (RF) and millimeter-wave signals—which are central in defense-relevant domains such as communications, signals intelligence, and electronic warfare—DARPA’s new Dynamic Range-enhanced Electronics and Materials (DREaM) program is designed to provide openings to these path-breaking advances."</em> <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2017-03-16a">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Make the most of that beauty spot. Ultrathin temporary electronic tattoos can now turn body blemishes into touch-sensitive buttons, letting you control your smartphone with your own wrinkles, freckles and other skin features. People intuitively know the location of their own bumps and birthmarks, which makes them ideal locations for touch-sensitive buttons, says Martin Weigel at Saarland University in Saarbrücken, Germany, who has led the research. You could squeeze a freckle to answer a phone call, or slide a finger over your knuckles to change the volume of your music. Weigel and his colleagues at Saarland University and Google used conductive ink to print wires and electrodes on temporary tattoo paper. The tattoos, which they call SkinMarks, are thinner than the width of a human hair. They are transferred onto the skin using water and last a couple of days before rubbing off."</em> <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2124961-e-tattoos-turn-knuckles-and-freckles-into-smartphone-controls">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"The system conceived in Eindhoven is simple and, in principle, cheap to set up. The wireless data comes from a few central ‘light antennas’, for instance mounted on the ceiling, which are able to very precisely direct the rays of light supplied by an optical fiber. Since there are no moving parts, it is maintenance-free and needs no power: the antennas contain a pair of gratings that radiate light rays of different wavelengths at different angles (‘passive diffraction gratings’). Changing the light wavelengths also changes the direction of the ray of light. Since a safe infrared wavelength is used that does not reach the vulnerable retina in your eye, this technique is harmless. If you walk around as a user and your smartphone or tablet moves out of the light antenna’s line of sight, then another light antenna takes over. The network tracks the precise location of every wireless device using its radio signal transmitted in the return direction. It is a simple matter to add devices: they are assigned different wavelengths by the same light antenna and so do not have to share capacity. Moreover, there is no longer any interference from a neighboring wi-fi network."</em> <a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/university/news-and-press/news/17-03-2017-wi-fi-on-rays-of-light-100-times-faster-and-never-overloaded/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"The way doctors examine the bladder for tumors or stones is like exploring the contours of a cave with a flashlight. Using cameras attached to long, flexible instruments called endoscopes, they find that it’s sometimes difficult to orient the location of masses within the bladder’s blood vessel-lined walls. This could change with a new computer vision technique developed by Stanford researchers that creates three-dimensional bladder reconstructions out of the endoscope’s otherwise fleeting images. With this fusion of medicine and engineering, doctors could develop organ maps, better prepare for operations and detect early cancer recurrences."</em> <a href="http://news.stanford.edu/2017/03/16/stanford-scientists-create-three-dimensional-bladder-reconstruction/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Vibrato is the up-down oscillation in pitch introduced during instrumental or vocal performance, intended to add expressivity and to facilitate sound projection, and commonly used in opera. A well-timed and beautifully executed vibrato can greatly enhance the sound quality of a note, and induce strong emotional responses in the listener. The new approach to vibrato analysis, published in the Journal of Mathematics and Music, describes for the first time the use of the Filter Diagonalisation Method (FDM) in music signal processing. The technique has origins in quantum physics and is employed to study molecular dynamics and nuclear magnetic resonance."</em> <a href="http://www.qmul.ac.uk/media/news/items/se/193712.html">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"A team of researchers based in Switzerland is on the way to laying bare much of the secret technology inside commercial processors. They pointed a beam of X-rays at a piece of an Intel processor and were able to reconstruct the chip’s warren of transistors and wiring in three dimensions. In the future, the team says, this imaging technique could be extended to create high-resolution, large-scale images of the interiors of chips. The technique is a significant departure from the way the chip industry currently looks inside finished chips, in order to reverse engineer them or check that their own intellectual property hasn’t been misused.

<h2><a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2017-03-17-new-computer-software-programme-excels-lip-reading">New computer software programme excels at lip reading</a></h2>

<p><em>"A new computer software programme has the potential to lip-read more accurately than people and to help those with hearing loss, Oxford University researchers have found. Watch, Attend and Spell (WAS), is a new artificial intelligence (AI) software system that has been developed by Oxford, in collaboration with the company DeepMind. The AI system uses computer vision and machine learning methods to learn how to lip-read from a dataset made up of more than 5,000 hours of TV footage, gathered from six different programmes including Newsnight, BBC Breakfast and Question Time. The videos contained more than 118,000 sentences in total, and a vocabulary of 17,500 words. The research team compared the ability of the machine and a human expert to work out what was being said in the silent video by focusing solely on each speaker’s lip movements. They found that the software system was more accurate compared to the professional. The human lip-reader correctly read 12 per cent of words, while the WAS software recognised 50 per cent of the words in the dataset, without error. The machine’s mistakes were small, including things like missing an “s” at the end of a word, or single letter misspellings."</em> <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2017-03-17-new-computer-software-programme-excels-lip-reading">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"In this age of smartphones and tablet computers, touch-sensitive surfaces are everywhere. They’re also brittle, as people with cracked phone screens everywhere can attest. Covering a robot — or an airplane or a bridge — with sensors will require a technology that is both flexible and cost-effective to manufacture in bulk. A team of researchers at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory thinks that 3-D printing could be the answer. In an attempt to demonstrate the feasibility of flexible, printable electronics that combine sensors and processing circuitry and can act on their environments, the researchers have designed and built a device that responds to mechanical stresses by changing the color of a spot on its surface. The device was inspired by the golden tortoise beetle, or “goldbug,” an insect whose exterior usually appears golden but turns reddish orange if the insect is poked or prodded — that is, mechanically stressed."</em>  <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/goldbug-beetle-printable-sensor-laden-skin-robots-0323">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="https://phys.org/news/2017-03-scientists-technology-genome-zika-virus.html">Scientists use new technology to assemble genome of Zika virus mosquito</a></h2>

<p><em>"A team spanning Baylor College of Medicine, Rice University, Texas Children's Hospital and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard has developed a new way to sequence genomes, which can assemble the genome of an organism, entirely from scratch, dramatically cheaper and faster. While there is much excitement about the so-called "$1000 genome" in medicine, when a doctor orders the DNA sequence of a patient, the test merely compares fragments of DNA from the patient to a reference genome. The task of generating a reference genome from scratch is an entirely different matter; for instance, the original human genome project took 10 years and cost $4 billion. The ability to quickly and easily generate a reference genome from scratch would open the door to creating reference genomes for everything from patients to tumors to all species on earth. Today in Science, the multi-institutional team reports a method - called 3D genome assembly - that can create a human reference genome, entirely from scratch, for less than $10,000. To illustrate the power of 3D genome assembly, the researchers have assembled the 1.2 billion letter genome of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which carries the Zika virus, producing the first end-to-end assembly of each of its three chromosomes. The new genome will enable scientists to better combat the Zika outbreak by identifying vulnerabilities in the mosquito that the virus uses to spread."</em> <a href="https://phys.org/news/2017-03-scientists-technology-genome-zika-virus.html">[...]</a></p>

I've included a video that shows this engine in a new design I have yet to complete. Having a smaller total displacement than my previous design, this engine runs longer on balloon power but as a trade off delivers less torque. Also, being smaller and having a crank shaft that is assembled in place requires even more fine scraping, sanding and/or filing and meticulous assembly steps to make this engine work at its peak efficiency, so be patient during the printing, preparing and assembly process.

Nowadays, you can get a complete FM radio tuner on a chip but these chips are surface-mount components and difficult for a hobbyist to work with. Fortunately, Sparkfun makes a breakout for the Silicon Laboratories Si4703 FM radio tuner chip (datasheet), which breaks out all pins. I will show you how you can build a complete FM radio around this breakout and use an Arduino to control the tuner functions over the built-in two-wire control interface. Sparkfun provides a complete library making this easy to program. At the same time, I added a cool little OLED display to the project with very high contrast and very low power consumption. Last but not least, I will show you how you can build a great-sounding mono audio amplifier from a minimum of parts.

The best way to validate a O2 sensor is functioning normally is to check responsiveness to changes in the air/fuel mixture with an oscilloscope. if an oscilloscope is not available, the O2 sensor's output voltage can be read with a scan tool or digital voltmeter, but the transitions are hard to see because the numbers fluctuate quite a bit.

<p><em>"Nowadays it is very common to use batteries on makers projects. The propose of the project is to be able to solder easily on lithium batteries without using battery case holders. This cool solution allows to build a small and cheap spot welding machine. Spot welders based on capacitors use large capacitors to store electrical energy and release it quickly. Capacitors can deliver large current peaks extremely fast. The capacitors discharge energy is dissipated due to the metal resistance in the form of heat which melts and fuses metal pieces. A large current passes through the work piece and weld nugget is formed in few milliseconds."</em> <a href="https://importhack.wordpress.com/2017/03/19/arduino-spot-welder/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Several years ago, a scammer woke me up at 4 am. Some nonsense about me "owing to the IRS". A few months later, some clueless telemarketer forgot about the existence of time zones and rang me up at 6 am. "It would be awesome to have a device that turns phone off during the night hours, then turns it back on during the day, all done automatically!" - was an obvious idea that popped into my mind. That was years before I have got myself interested in electronics. Yes, I am talking about the POTS (plain old telephone service, a.k.a. landline), since modern smartphones have this useful function built in. Now that I know a bit more about electronics and POTS in particular, I figured that turning the entire phone off is actually an overkill. I have built a circuit that achieves all of the following objectives: It prevents ringing of all the phones in the house that are on the same line, simultaneously; To the outside caller it just appears like nobody is picking the phone up. Otherwise, the circuit does not interfere with normal phone operations and calls can be made at any time. It is powered from the phone line itself. There are no other power sources. It is practically undetectable by the phone company, because it uses only a very small amount of power during its 6-minute startup, after which it enters a very low power mode using only 4 uA of current. If you already know all the basics of POTS signaling, or don't care about the underlying principles, then you can skip the next step."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Invisible-Killer-of-the-Phone-Ring/">[...]</a></p>

Before we start on how to build the device I would like to thank Ada and her guide on making a POV display. I have used the code from her guide as inspiration, a stepping stone and a huge part of her code exist in my example. The biggest difference is I have made the code work with the popular WiFi microprocesser, ESP8266. I'm using a NodeMCU v2 in my example wich required a lot of tweaking. My main reasoning behind choosing a ESP8266 device is that it is a powerfull piece of hardware, and you can implement wireless communication to control the image, syncronize multiple units or what ever you can come up with. Another difference is that I have implementet a image stabilizer that should make the screen more readable when riding the bike (there is a lot room for improvement, but if you want a finished and professionel consumer product buy POV from Monkeylectric). The last difference is that I'm using cheaper parts in my build. The SK9822/APA102 is basicly the same hardware as Adafruit Dotstar, but way cheaper. You can get a NodeMCU for only $3.95 if you can wait for it to ship."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/POV-Bike-Display-ESP8266-APA102-UNDER-CONSTRUCTION/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"What is the lowest possible clock frequency at which a microcontroller can still do useful work? Here’s a little project that attempts to explore this weird question. A couple of years ago, while I was studying the then-Atmel ATtiny85 microcontroller, I was fascinated by the fact that I could make it run at a mere 0.5Hz, using an Arduino board with a standard Blink sketch as an external clock source.  When I reported this on a local forum, someone wondered what could possibly be done at these speeds. I gave it some thought and answered that if you put a light sensor on your roof to make a clock signal from the day/night cycle, you could probably create a system that will light up an LED every Saturday. Now, that doesn’t sound particularly useful, but it should be remembered that for religious Jews, Shabbat (Saturday) is sacred and important in many ways. Moreover, according to the Hebrew calendar, a new day begins more or less at sunset, not at midnight. So silly as it is, if this system is done right, it will be actually meaningful – if not practical – to some people."</em> <a href="http://www.idogendel.com/en/archives/579">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"For a while now I have been thinking about the ability to remotely monitor what is going on environmentally in a location. I have thought about this with regards to the summer, with a cottage more than an hour away it would be nice to know what the weather pattern is for the cottages location (not the general city or county) to decide if it is worth the long drive. I have also thought about this with regards to parts of my house, such as the attic, basement etc, to help determine how well the insulation is working or what is going on in parts of the house where people may not often frequent. Lastly it has come up in many conversations with storekeepers who want to know how their fridges are performing and to know when there may be an issue. With all these usage cases I decided I should come up with a solution. When TI came out with their CC3000 I thought I would give that a try. I spent a few weeks working with this BoosterPack in conjunction with a Stellaris (Tiva C) and MSP430G2553  launchpad but had a good few issues that just didn't seem easily resolvable as well as some limitations that hinder the usability of the system, besides by then TI had come out with the CC3100 that was supposed to resolve a lot of issues as well as be some what easier to use."</em> <a href="http://kasembeddedprojects.blogspot.pt/2014/09/sending-atmospheric-data-from-msp430.html">[...]</a></p>
