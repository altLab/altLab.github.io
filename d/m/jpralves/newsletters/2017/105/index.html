<p><em>"A team of scientists from eastern China has built the first form of quantum computer that they say is faster than one of the early generation of conventional computers developed in the 1940s. The researchers at the University of Science and Technology of China at Hefei in Anhui province built the machine as part of efforts to develop and highlight the future use of quantum computers. The devices make use of the way particles interact at a subatomic level to make calculations rather than conventional computers which use electronic gates, switches and binary code. The Hefei machine predicts the highly complex movement and behaviour of subatomic particles called photons, which make up light. Normal supercomputers struggle to predict the behaviour of photons because of their huge level of unpredictability and the difficulties in modelling. Pan Jianwei, the lead scientist on the project, told a press briefing in Shanghai on Wednesday that their device was already 10 to 11 times faster at carrying out the calculations than the first electronic digital computer, ENIAC, would have been capable of. ENIAC was developed in the 1940s."</em> <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2092635/chinese-scientists-claim-milestone-developing-quantum">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.en.aau.dk/news/show-news/internet-of-the-future--massive-mobile-antennae-technology-.cid312450">Internet of the future: massive mobile antennae technology</a></h2>

<p><em>"Mobile base stations for 5G solutions will consist of hundreds of small antennas. Benefits include faster transmission, improved energy efficiency, better security and wider coverage. Researchers at Aalborg University are at the forefront of developing the new antenna technology. As we move toward a world that is increasingly interconnected with a 5G network that is expected to roll out during the next 3-5 years, the need for a well-functioning mobile network with ample room for more connected devices as well as increased data traffic becomes increasingly important. “With the ‘internet of things’ as it is popularly known, more and more devices need to be connected,” says Elisabeth De Carvalho, Associate Professor in the Department of Electronic Systems at Aalborg University. Along with her colleagues Associate Professors Patrick Eggers, Jesper Ødum Nielsen and PhD fellow Anders Karstensen and with funding from the Chinese technology giant Huawei she is working on a new type of base system that caters to the seemingly endless increased need for data transmission. The system that is still in its early stages is called a ‘massive MIMO’. MIMO is an abbreviation for ‘Multiple-Input Multiple-Output’ – a wireless technology used to transmit and receive data between a large crowd of connected devices and users at the same time. In today’s mobile base stations - the mobile antennas that we might have noticed attached to tall buildings or rooftops – each unit might have a maximum of eight antennas that point out in different directions, spreading out data transmission over a large area. But the team in Aalborg is working on a base station unit that holds several hundred antennas, making it possible to connect much more precisely to each mobile unit."</em> <a href="http://www.en.aau.dk/news/show-news/internet-of-the-future--massive-mobile-antennae-technology-.cid312450">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Using silicon and carbon materials, researchers at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) have developed a tactile sensor that can act as skin for robots, which can absorb shock and distinguish various forms of touch. Current robotic sensory technology allows robots to have visual and auditory systems at nearly similar levels to human capacity, but there are limitations in tactile sensors that can detect changes in the environment throughout the body. To apply skin with similar functions as humans to robots, it is essential to develop skin sensor technology with high flexibility and high shock absorption. Another limitation for developing robot skin was connecting numerous sensors all over the body using electric wiring. To overcome this problem, the research team led by Professors Jung Kim and Inkyu Park from the Department of Mechanical Engineering combined silicon and carbon nanotubes (CNT) to produce a composite, which was then used in combination with a medical imaging technique called electrical impedance tomography (EIT)."</em> <a href="https://www.eetasia.com/news/article/flexible-tactile-sensor-lets-robots-feel">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://news.ncsu.edu/2017/04/kohar-chaos/">Hybrid Digital-Analog Circuits Can Increase Computational Power of Chaos-Based Systems</a></h2>

<p><em>"New research from North Carolina State University has found that combining digital and analog components in nonlinear, chaos-based integrated circuits can improve their computational power by enabling processing of a larger number of inputs. This “best of both worlds” approach could lead to circuits that can perform more computations without increasing their physical size. Computer scientists and designers are struggling to keep up with Moore’s law, which states that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit will double every two years in order to meet processing demands. They are rapidly reaching the limits of physics in terms of transistor size – it isn’t possible to continue shrinking the transistors to fit more on a chip. Chaos-based, nonlinear circuits have been proposed as a solution to the problem, as one circuit can perform multiple computations instead of the current “one circuit, one task” design. However, the number of inputs that can be processed in chaos-based computing is limited by ambient noise, which decreases accuracy. Ambient noise refers to random signal fluctuations that can be caused by temperature variations, voltage fluctuations or semiconductor defects."</em> <a href="https://news.ncsu.edu/2017/04/kohar-chaos/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/control-of-molecular-motion-by-metal-plated-3d-pri/">Control of molecular motion by metal-plated 3D-printed plastic pieces</a></h2>

<p><em>"Many measurement techniques, such as spectroscopy, benefit from the ability to split a single beam of light into two in order to measure changes in one of them. The crucial device that separates the beam is the beam-splitter. These have been mostly limited to light beams, where one uses simply a partially reflective glass. EPFL scientists have now developed a similar device for splitting beams of molecules, where high-voltage electrodes are used to control the motion of the molecules inside a vacuum. The electrodes are built by an innovative method that combines 3D printing and electroplating for the fabrication of complex metallic structures. The same approach can also be used in a wide range of other experiments. The new method is published in Physical Review Applied and overcomes previous fabrication problems thus opening up new avenues. Sean Gordon and Andreas Osterwalder at EPFL’s Institute of Chemical Sciences and Engineering, developed the new fabrication method, and demonstrated it by constructing the complicated combination of electrodes required to guide and split beams of molecules. The production method not only allows complex shapes to be made but, in addition, speeds up production by a factor of 50-100. The technique begins by 3D-printing a plastic piece and then electroplating a 10 μm-thick metal layer onto it. Electroplating is an established technique in various branches of industry like the automobile industry, fabrication of jewelry, or plumbing. It generally uses electrolysis to coat a conductive material with a metallic layer. “but the plating of printed pieces has not been done before in the context of scientific applications,” says Andreas Osterwalder. To make the printed plastic pieces conductive and thus amenable to electroplating, they were first pre-treated by a special procedure developed by the company Galvotec near Zurich. Once the first conductive layer was applied, the pieces could be treated as if they were metallic. The first step can be applied selectively to certain regions of the printed piece, so that the final device contains some areas that are metallic and conductive while others remain insulating."</em> <a href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/control-of-molecular-motion-by-metal-plated-3d-pri/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.fraunhofer.de/en/press/research-news/2017/may/heat-resistant-capacitors--stability-at-up-to-300-degrees.html">Heat-resistant capacitors: Stability at up to 300 degrees</a></h2>

<p><em>"Heat is one of the worst enemies of electronics. It can disrupt functionality and cause electronic components to age more quickly, or even destroy them. Now Fraunhofer researchers have developed a capacitor that can withstand temperatures of up to 300 degrees Celsius. They did so by using an innovative mix of materials – and a special 3D trick. Heat, dust and moisture damage electronic components. Protecting against dust and moisture is fairly straightforward, but heat remains a problem because it is created within the component itself. Anywhere electricity flows, heat is generated as well. There is not always enough space in the electronic component to draw away the waste heat with cooling fins or ventilators. Devices that operate in a hot environment pose an even bigger problem. For example, a drill bit in the oil industry rotates at high speeds thousands of meters below the surface, generating temperatures of up to 250 degrees – not to mention the enormous mechanical load on the electronic components. Fortunately, the Fraunhofer Institute for Microelectronic Circuits and Systems IMS has a solution to this problem: a capacitor that can withstand temperatures of up to 300 degrees. By comparison, conventional electronics can cope with temperatures only up to 125 degrees. Capacitors store charge carriers and are among the most frequently used passive structural elements in electronics. The design of a capacitor is simple: it has two conducting plates, which function as the plus and minus electrodes, separated by an insulating layer called the dielectric. Dorothee Dietz, a scientist at Fraunhofer IMS, and her team were able to improve the capacitor’s heat resistance by using an innovative mix of materials and several design tricks."</em> <a href="https://www.fraunhofer.de/en/press/research-news/2017/may/heat-resistant-capacitors--stability-at-up-to-300-degrees.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Australian and German researchers have collaborated to develop a genetic algorithm to confirm the rejection of classical notions of causality. RMIT's Dr Alberto Peruzzo said: “Bell’s theorem excludes classical concepts of causality and is now a cornerstone of modern physics. “But despite the fundamental importance of this theorem, only recently was the first ‘loophole-free’ experiment reported which convincingly verified that we must reject classical notions of causality. “Given the importance of this data, an international collaboration between Australian and German institutions has developed a new method of analysis to robustly quantify such conclusions.” The team’s approach was to use genetic programming, a powerful machine learning technique, to automatically find the closest classical models for the data. Together, the team applied machine learning to find the closest classical explanations of experimental data, allowing them to map out many dimensions of the departure from classical that quantum correlations exhibit. Dr Chris Ferrie, from the University of Technology Sydney, said: “We’ve light-heartedly called the region mapped out by the algorithm the ‘edge of reality,’ referring to the common terminology ‘local realism’ for a model of physics satisfying Einstein’s relativity."</em> <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/news/all-news/2017/apr/mapping-the-edge-of-reality">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Robots aren’t generally meant to get confused, but modeling confusion might help make them more useful workmates. As part of an effort to explore ways for humans and robots to work together more naturally and effectively, a team of researchers at Brown University has developed a robot that measures its own confusion and then asks for help if it feels it needs it. The work is important because it’s so easy for confusion to arise in everyday interactions. So making relations with a robot as natural as possible means figuring out ways of coping with this. The robot takes a command and measures with what certainty it can respond. And when it isn’t sure what’s being asked of it, it requests help. Previous work by the Brown University team allowed a robot to read both speech and hand gesture cues to infer what’s being asked of it. The researchers have shown that this is more effective than voice commands alone. If, however, a human asks for a wrench but there are two wrenches near each other, the robot will now decide if the situation is too uncertain and ask for further information, pointing to one and saying, “This one?” This is the latest step toward mimicking the way two people hold a conversation, says Stefanie Tellex, an assistant professor at Brown University and the lead researcher on the project."</em> <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/604031/this-robot-knows-when-its-confused-and-asks-for-help/">[...]</a>

Despite significant breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, it has been notoriously hard for computers to understand why a user behaves the way she does.

<p><em>"How lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries behave under short-circuit conditions can now be examined, using a new approach to help improve reliability and safety - developed by an international research team, including WMG at the University of Warwick. The use of high energy density Li-ion batteries is ubiquitous – from powering portable electronics to providing grid-scale storage – but defects can lead to overheating and explosions. Although catastrophic failure is extremely rare, recent high-profile cases including the recall of Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 smartphone line and the grounding of an aircraft fleet highlight why it’s important to understand battery failure. Romeo Malik, a researcher at WMG, explained the experiment: “As the safety and reliability of batteries is paramount, it is important to know and understand the extreme scenarios of battery failure. “In this work, we were able to see the initiation of thermal runway and how quickly it escalated to the neighbouring cells in seconds. Being able to observe and capture these rapid failures with high-speed X-ray imaging technique is amazing.”"</em> <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/revolutionary_method_reveals/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Dr. Robin Murphy, Raytheon Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Texas A&amp;M University and director of the Texas A&amp;M Engineering Experiment Station’s Center for Robot-Assisted Search and Rescue, saw a need for a safer, more efficient way to use quadcopter unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in indoor disaster environments. Her idea for a quadcopter tethered to a home-base robot was inspired by marsupials, who have external pouches to hold their young and keep them close. Murphy has been working with marsupial robots since 1998, with ground-ground teams and boat-aerial robot teams supported by the National Science Foundation and the Office of Naval Research. In the case of her new robots, the ‘mother’ provides a steady connection for the ‘baby’ quadcopter to safely assess the situation of a dangerous, indoor environment without the hazard of crashing into a potentially disastrous object. Not only does the mother provide stability, it delivers a steady power source for the baby to feed off of to stay in-flight longer. Fotokite is the company who developed the quadcopter robot, and Endeavor Robotics developed the PackBot-base mother robot. The mother-daughter combination can be used in countless dangerous situations, such as nuclear power or chemical plants where it is unsafe to fly UAVs. It could be used to rapidly respond to an incident or, if used routinely, to prevent damage from occurring."</em> <a href="http://engineering.tamu.edu/news/2017/05/01/murphy-develops-another-marsupial-inspired-robot">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/article/the-worlds-fastest-film-camera-when-light-practically-stands-still">The world’s fastest film camera: when light practically stands still</a></h2>

<p><em>"Forget high-speed cameras capturing 100 000 images per second. A research group at Lund University in Sweden has developed a camera that can film at a rate equivalent to five trillion images per second, or events as short as 0.2 trillionths of a second. This is faster than has previously been possible. The new super-fast film camera will therefore be able to capture incredibly rapid processes in chemistry, physics, biology and biomedicine, that so far have not been caught on film. To illustrate the technology, the researchers have successfully filmed how light – a collection of photons – travels a distance corresponding to the thickness of a paper. In reality, it only takes a picosecond, but on film the process has been slowed down by a trillion times. Currently, high-speed cameras capture images one by one in a sequence. The new technology is based on an innovative algorithm, and instead captures several coded images in one picture. It then sorts them into a video sequence afterwards. In short, the method involves exposing what you are filming (for example a chemical reaction) to light in the form of laser flashes where each light pulse is given a unique code. The object reflects the light flashes which merge into the single photograph. They are subsequently separated using an encryption key. The film camera is initially intended to be used by researchers who literally want to gain better insight into many of the extremely rapid processes that occur in nature. Many take place on a picosecond and femtosecond scale, which is unbelievably fast – the number of femtoseconds in one second is significantly larger than the number of seconds in a person’s life-time."</em> <a href="http://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/article/the-worlds-fastest-film-camera-when-light-practically-stands-still">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.exeter.ac.uk/news/featurednews/title_581068_en.html">‘Good vibrations’ no longer needed for speakers as new research encourages graphene to talk</a></h2>

<p><em>"A pioneering new technique that encourages the wonder material graphene to “talk” could revolutionise the global audio and telecommunications industries. Researchers from the University of Exeter have devised a ground-breaking method to use graphene to generate complex and controllable sound signals. In essence, it combines speaker, amplifier and graphic equaliser into a chip the size of a thumbnail. Traditional speakers mechanically vibrate to produce sound, with a moving coil or membrane pushing the air around it back and forth. It is a bulky technology that has hardly changed in more than a century. This innovative new technique involves no moving parts. A layer of the atomically thin material graphene is rapidly heated and cooled by an alternating electric current, and transfer of this thermal variation to the air causes it to expand and contract, thereby generating sound waves. Though the conversion of heat into sound is not new, the Exeter team are the first to show that this simple process allows sound frequencies to be mixed together, amplified and equalised - all within the same millimetre-sized device. With graphene being almost completely transparent, the ability to produce complex sounds without physical movement could open up a new golden generation of audio-visual technologies, including mobile phone screens that transmit both pictures and sound. The research is published in leading journal, Scientific Reports."</em> <a href="https://www.exeter.ac.uk/news/featurednews/title_581068_en.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This project was born out of constellation of things and desires :) I've always wanted to make up a CMOY amplifier, just because I think it is a cool project and I always wanted to see if the headphones amplifier makes sense. I did buy my components, but never got to actually making it. Next, while looking through my stuff recently, I've came across these 16340 cells that I bought for some reason. And finally, being a long time user of PCB sensors (excellent btw), both in the academy and in the industry, I wondered if we can find a "better" use for their sensor boxes other than...well.. holding sensors :) It all boiled up to the point when I decided to fit a CMOY amplifier inside one of these boxes. Since we are in the modern age, of course it will be powered from rechargeable lithium battery which can be easily charged and used for charging phones and stuff. And being in the modern age, why not fit an additional Bluetooth speaker to the device? The merit for this is as follows: the main functionality is to be a headphone amplifier (it is worth it by the way). Then, every once in a while you will need the bluetooth speaker, so just flip the switch and use it. And along the way you will want to charge an occasional phone. This device will give the answers for all three.

<p><em>"Before I begin at the moment I am waiting for final parts to take all my pictures for the sake of this instructable. I am going to post this before I finish so people can have an earlier access. I believe all my instructions are clear enough to be understood even without images so I hope you enjoy and please wait and check back in a few days to see the final design. First off, I am a sophomore high school student who actively participates in FTC Robotics representing Shark Beta Team #10088 and FatherBoards Team #10087. The goal of our robotics team is to learn as much as possible before graduating and going off to college. One crucial skill everybody on our teams had the desire to learn was how to manually lathe parts our self instead of sending the files for somebody else to machine them for us. This was where the idea of building my own lathe came in. As our school did not want to purchase a full-size lathe or for that matter allow students to operate a full-size lathe; the only other option was to build a miniature one myself. The major challenge of this project was that because all of our funds go straight into our robotics program and purchasing parts, the lathe had to be constructed out of existing parts in our lab, or the parts needed to be made personally (this is where the idea of 3D printing the lathe itself came into play. Another major challenge of this project was that the lathe needed to be relatively precise and accurate so that the final parts could actually be used on our robots. Those were the main challences I was faced with and I believe I did a relatively good job at solving these. If you do decide to build this you will find how percise and accurite it is despite it being 3D printed. So lets get to building!"</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/3D-Printed-Lathe/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.righto.com/2017/04/reverse-engineering-76477-space.html">Reverse engineering the 76477 "Space Invaders" sound effect chip from die photos</a></h2>

<p><em>"Remember the old video game Space Invaders? Some of its sound effects were provided by a chip called the 76477 Complex Sound Generation chip. While the sound effects1 produced by this 1978 chip seem primitive today, it was used in many video games, pinball games. But what's inside this chip and how does it work internally? By reverse-engineering the chip from die photos, we can find out. (Photos courtesy of Sean Riddle.) In this article, I explain how the analog circuits of this chip works and show how the hundreds of transistors on the silicon die form the circuits of this complex chip. The 76477 chip combines several functional blocks to produce a variety of sound effects. A voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) produces a signal whose frequency depends on the control voltage. A "super low frequency" SLF oscillator generates a triangle wave. Feeding this into the VCO generates a varying pitch, useful for bird chirps, sirens, or the warbling sound of the UFO in Space Invaders. A "one-shot" produces a pulse of a fixed length to control the length of the sound. An envelope generator makes the sound more realistic by ramping its amplitude (volume) up at the start and down at the end. A digital white noise generator can be used for drums, gunshots, explosions and other similar sound effects. Finally a digital mixer combines these signals and feeds them to the output amplifier. The diagram below indicates the functional blocks on the 76477 die. Looking under a microscope, you can see the circuitry that makes up the chip. The yellowish lines are metal traces that connect the circuits of the die. The reddish and greenish regions are the silicon of the chip, forming transistors and resistors. The black blobs around the edges of the chip show where tiny bond wires connected the die to the integrated circuit pins. Analog circuits are outlined in purple, while digital circuits are in cyan. The 76477 is primarily analog—most control signals are analog, the chip has no digital registers, and most sounds are generated from analog circuits—but about a third of the chip's area is digital logic."</em> <a href="http://www.righto.com/2017/04/reverse-engineering-76477-space.html">[...]</a>

The foam roller is movable, which means you can lift it when not in use. I've also added speed controls for the driver motors.

<h2><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Solar-Tracker-Using-Arduino-and-Raspberry-Pi-3/">Solar Tracker Using Arduino and Raspberry Pi 3</a></h2>

<p><em>"This Instructable will teach you how to create a solar tracker using Arduino and Raspberry Pi 3 Model B. We will also learn how to create a graphic user interface using Processing. As we all know, energy is an indispensable part of our lives. From transportation to agriculture, cooking to water heating, air conditioners to refrigerators, using laptops to watching television, using phones to watch silly videos to typing this very Instructable, everything needs energy! Solar energy is the cleanest form of renewable energy which can be used to satisfy the growing need for energy while supporting sustainable development. However, the use of solar energy can face certain problems. One such problem is that the position of the sun throughout the day varies. We can solve this problem by creating a solar tracker. A solar tracker is a device which tracks the position of the sun and alters the position of the solar panel to maximize the power output of the system."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Solar-Tracker-Using-Arduino-and-Raspberry-Pi-3/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Building-Garage-IoT-a-Hackers-Journey/">Building Garage IoT: a Hacker’s Journey</a></h2>

<p><em>"Shortly after moving into my new home, I found a key switch (above) near the front of my garage. I tested all the keys I was given and none of them worked. At the time, I had lots of bigger projects to work on, so I left it at that. Eventually, I got around to taking a closer look and I traced the key switch’s wires to the inside button that open and closed my garage. Hmmmm. I quickly cut and striped the wires near the key switch and found that if I touched them together, my garage would open! I did not like this! Anyone with a pair of vise grips, or better yet a dremel, could remove the “security bolts”, unmount the switch from the outside, cut the wires, and touch them to get into my garage. Even if I replaced the key switch with a keypad, or retina scanner for that matter, it would still be vulnerable to the previously outlined attack if it was using those 2 wires. I needed to somehow make the wiring that an attacker could access be independent from the logic to open the garage or not. I had two ideas. The first idea was to use a microcontroller and a keypad. The keypad would simply communicate number key presses to the microcontroller, which would chose to open the garage or not. This way if an attacker gained access to the wires, there would be nothing they could short to open the garage. Well, that’s not technically true, because they could short the correct button wires in the correct order to open the garage, but you get the point. The second idea was to use a microcontroller running a web server that I could connect to using my phone to open the garage. The beauty here is that there are no wires exposed for an attacker, however, there are other things to consider. For example, the security and access of my garage via this channel hinges on the availability and security of the web server on the microcontroller. I ultimately decided to build the later because it’s way cooler to open my garage from my phone and it would be a good exercise at attempting to build and secure an IoT device. I am penetration tester, so making sure the device is secure was very important to me."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Building-Garage-IoT-a-Hackers-Journey/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"It measures solar radiation and visualizes the corresponding value on the integrated display of a miniaturized Arduino, in order to tell us when to expose ourselves to the sun… Summer is just around the corner and whether you choose the seaside or the mountains for your holidays, there is no doubt that most of the people look for a sunny summer in order to come back with the most enviable suntan. Since sunlight contains ultraviolet rays, which are by the way responsible for our suntan, the first concern when it comes to sun rays is to protect ourselves, at least during the first days, with a sun lotion of adequate protection and by taking care to remain outside as little as possible, unless we have a sunshade or a sun umbrella. It is also useful to know the UV quantity contained in the sunlight, in fact, according to our geographic location and weather conditions, the atmosphere can retain UV rays more or less effectively. Getting to know the concentration (index) of UV rays is important because UV rays do not only cause sunburns but are also responsible for skin tumors, that is why we should try to get only the good part from the sun, which is composed of visible light or infrared light, and keep ultraviolet rays as far away as possible. This is the same reason why it is not recommended to sunbathe too long in certain geographical areas and on certain days. On an international level, UVI or UV index is the recognized parameter used to classify UV rays intensity, which is better described in the box you will find in these pages; that’s why in this article we are going to show you how to realize a device to measure and display the UV index, that you might use in order to verify the quantity of ultraviolet rays you are exposed to during your sunbathing session or, if you stay in the city, this will tell you when not to go out during the hottest afternoons in July and August and when you can go out with peace of mind, especially if you suffer from skin problems."</em> <a href="https://www.open-electronics.org/save-your-skin-with-this-open-source-uv-index-detector/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The heart of the Hammond B3 Organ is the tone generator. This iconic jazz instrument relied on a series of metal disks each with a varying number of bumps along the edge. Those bumps allowed the metal disks when spun to warp the magnetic field of the electromagnetic pickups inducing current and producing near perfect sinusoidal signals. Those signals were then actively summed to produce the wide range of notes and tones needed for the organ. The Hammond B3 could produce seven and a half octaves using 91 separate disks. This technology ceased to be used for instruments with the advent of digital technology but it remains a forever desired sound and a fantastic demonstration of basic electrical engineering principles. The following will describe the construction of a very basic, single octave tone generator, based on the principles described above. It is a rough design in need of improvements that will be described at the end of the instructions. This Electromechanical Tone Generator was designed as a project for the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Utah State University."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Electromechanical-Tone-Generator/">[...]</a>
