<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1717, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_le_Rond_d%27Alembert">Jean le Rond d'Alembert</a>. Este matemático francês ficou conhecido pelo seu trabalho em vários campos da matemática aplicada, em particular o da dinâmica. Em 1743 publicou seu "Traité de Dynamique", no qual aplica a terceira lei do movimento de Newton, em que a lei de Newton não só é válida para os corpos fixos, mas também para os corpos em movimento livre. D'Alembert também escreveu sobre a dinâmica dos fluidos, a teoria dos ventos, as propriedades das cordas vibratórias e experiências conduzidas sobre as propriedades do som. A sua inovação puramente matemática mais significativa foi sua invenção e desenvolvimento da teoria das equações diferenciais parciais.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1835, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenio_Beltrami">Eugenio Beltrami</a>. Este Matemático e físico matemático italiano ficou conhecido pelos seus conceitos de geometria não euclidiana. Em 1865, ele publicou um artigo sobre como elementos de linha nas superfícies de curvatura constante poderiam ser representados por expressões lineares. A sua abordagem ofereceu uma nova representação da geometria de curvatura constante que era consistente com a teoria euclidiana. Beltrami estudou elasticidade, teoria das ondas, óptica, termodinâmica e a teoria do potencial. Foi o primeiro a explorar os conceitos de hiperespaço e tempo como uma quarta dimensão. As suas investigações na condução de calor levaram a equações diferenciais parciais lineares. Alguns dos últimos trabalhos de Beltrami estavam numa interpretação mecânica das equações de Maxwell.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1841, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Violle">Jules Violle</a>. Este físico francês nascido em Langres, fez a primeira determinação de altitude da constante solar (em 1875, no Mont Blanc nos Alpes franceses e suíços). Ele também determinou os pontos de fusão de paládio, platina e ouro. Violle também estava interessado na teoria dos geysers, na origem do granizo e na exploração atmosférica através de amostragens por balão. Para radiação de alta temperatura, ele propôs uma unidade fotométrica, a violle ou o padrão de Violle (1881). Seu actinômetro é uma forma de pirheliômetro, um dispositivo para medir a intensidade da luz solar. Foi modificado a partir da invenção de John Herschel de 1825. Ele consiste em duas esferas concêntricas vazias contendo água entre elas. A luz do sol passa através de uma abertura e cai sobre uma lâmpada do termómetro na esfera interna oca.</p>

<p>Na semana que passou ficámos a saber que a Waymo agora está a testar os seus carros autónomos na via pública sem ninguém ao volante. Os testes também não estão limitados a uma ou duas rotas; A área de teste onde os ensaios verdadeiramente sem condutor estão a ser realizados é em Chandler, Arizona (parte da área metropolitana de Phoenix), e os carros podem ir a qualquer lugar dentro desse espaço definido. É difícil subestimar a importância deste marco: a Waymo está a operar em autonomia de nível 4, partilhando estradas públicas com carros e pedestres humanos, sem que ninguém no volante possa assumir o controlo, caso as coisas não funcionem como planeado.</p>

<p>Também esta semana uma equipa médica alemã procedeu à troca de cerca de 80 porcento da pele de uma criança de sete anos. Esta medida foi necessária para salvar a vida da criança que tinha uma patologia rara que lhe provocava feridas e bolhas expostas. Uma unidade de queimados tentou, sem sucesso, um tratamento convencional. Os médicos retiraram uma pequena amostra de pele de um dos poucos lugares no corpo da criança, que não estava afectada, e enviou para o prof. De Luca. A sua equipa no centro usou um vírus para inserir nas células da pele uma cópia correta de um gene chamado LAMB3; A própria cópia defeituosa do menino causou sua epidermólise bolhosa. De Luca e seus colegas cresceram as células da pele sobre estruturas artificiais no seu laboratório para formar grandes pedaços. Estes foram posteiormente aplicados em duas cirurgias na criança.</p>

<p>Ainda esta semana, Linus Torvalds anunciou a versão 4.14 do Kernel Linux. Esta versão tem um significado especial por ser de suporte longo (LTS). Apelidado de "Fearless Coyote", esta versão traz como novidades uma maior capacidade de endereçamento de memória na arquitectura x86_64, melhorias VEGA, suporte para compressão zstd adicionado, AMD Secure Memory Encryption em CPUs EPYC, novo driver wifi realtek, melhorias nos filesystems F2FS para Android e Btrfs, EXT4, XFS, etc.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como dois modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis. É apresentado também o livro "Don't Panic: Mobile Developer's Guide to The Galaxy, 17th Edition".</p>

<p><em>"Waymo recently hosted a number of journalists at its private Castle testing compound, and treated us to rides with no safety driver behind the wheel – now, the former Google self-driving car company is going farther still, however, launching public road tests of its autonomous Chrysler Pacifica minivans with no safety driver on board. The tests aren’t limited to one or two routes, either; the test area where the truly driverless trials are being conducted is in Chandler, Arizona (part of the greater Phoenix metro area), and the cars are able to go anywhere within this defined space. It’s hard to understate the importance of this milestone: Waymo is operating at full Level 4 autonomy, sharing public roads with human-driven cars and pedestrians, with no one at the wheel able to take over in case things don’t go as planned. That shows confidence – confidence that Waymo has managed to achieve truly capable L4 autonomy within the specific domain of Chandler. The current passengers for this test are Waymo employees, however, so it’s not as if the Alphabet-owned company is throwing caution to the wind; instead, it’s showing that it’s ready to move to the next major phase of operations after around a decade of working on this incredibly complex problem. Waymo CEO John Krafcik announced the fully driverless trials at Web Summit today, and revealed the video above, and also noted that while the trial is starting with employees first, it’s soon going to expand to the existing members of the Chandler driverless ride hailing service trial that Waymo kicked off at the beginning of 2017."</em> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/07/waymo-now-testing-its-self-driving-cars-on-public-roads-with-no-one-at-the-wheel/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The German doctors realized they had to do something drastic or their seven-year-old patient would die. The boy had escaped war-ravaged Syria with his parents, and a rare genetic disease had left him with raw, blistering sores over 80 percent of his body. His doctors in a children’s burn unit tried everything they could to treat his illness, called junctional epidermolysis bullosa—even grafting some skin from his father to see if it would heal the child’s wounds. But his body rejected this. Finally, they e-mailed Michele De Luca, a researcher in Italy, to ask for help. Twelve years earlier De Luca, director of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia’s Center for Regenerative Medicine had successfully used gene therapy to restore skin on the legs of someone with a similar disease."</em> <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/massive-skin-replacement-saves-childs-life/##">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Last month, in September, Linux kernel developer Greg Kroah-Hartman confirmed on his blog Linux kernel 4.14 as the next LTS kernel, which will be supported for at least two years; this number has recently been increased to six years. As a result, the development cycle of Linux 4.14 got a week longer than usual and we witnessed eight Release Candidates. 4.14 LTS “Fearless Coyote” is here Linux kernel 4.14, codenamed “Fearless Coyote,” has been released by Linus Torvalds. “The appended shortlog is obviously only for the (small) haul since rc8, and it really is tiny. Not very many commits, and they are small,” Torvalds wrote his Linux Kernel Mailing List announcement. He also took time to mention how 0day robot has been getting better."</em> <a href="https://fossbytes.com/linux-kernel-4-14-lts-released-features-download/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Called EksoVest, the wearable technology elevates and supports a worker’s arms while performing overhead tasks. - Ford assembly line workers are testing new upper body exoskeletal technology – EksoVest – that helps lessen the chance of fatigue or injury while performing overhead tasks - EksoVest is the latest example of advanced technology Ford is using to reduce the physical toll on employees during the vehicle assembly process - Since 2005, incidents in Ford’s North America facilities that resulted in time away from the job fell 83 percent; the 2016 incident rate was the lowest on record Putting dishes on a high shelf or changing an overhead lightbulb occasionally might not be difficult, but could you imagine performing either of these tasks 4,600 times per day? How about 1 million times a year? These are the approximate number of times some Ford assembly line workers lift their arms during overhead work tasks.

<p><em>"Imec, the world-leading research and innovation hub in nano-electronics and digital technologies, has designed and fabricated a breakthrough neural probe for the parallel recording of hundreds of neural signals. The Neuropixels probe was developed for an international consortium consisting of Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI), the Allen Institute for Brain Science, the Gatsby Charitable Foundation and Wellcome, with funding of $5.5 million.Scientists at HHMI’s Janelia Research Campus, the Allen Institute and University College London (UCL) worked together with engineers at nanotechnology company imec to build and test the probes that were designed and fabricated on imec’s advanced silicon platform, demonstrating its ability to create ultraprecise tools which are being recognized as a new gold standard in neuroscience research. The results were published in an edition of Nature this month and will also be presented at the Annual Meeting of the Society for Neuroscience in Washington, D.C., Nov. 11-15, 2017. Current techniques to map the activity of brain cells either lacked spatial or temporal resolution. Previous generations of neural probes can only record activity of a few dozen neurons, while optical imaging lacks in speed to distinguish individual spikes of activity. Imec’s Neuropixels probe solves both issues and enables precise real-time recording of the activity of hundreds of individual neurons."</em> <a href="https://www.imec-int.com/en/articles/imec-designs-and-fabricates-world-first-miniature-neural-probe-for-simultaneous-recording-of-multiple-brain-regions-at-neuronal-resolution">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Twice as big as Earth, the super-Earth 55 Cancri e was thought to have lava flows on its surface. The planet is so close to its star, the same side of the planet always faces the star, such that the planet has permanent day and night sides. Based on a 2016 study using data from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, scientists speculated that lava would flow freely in lakes on the starlit side and become hardened on the face of perpetual darkness. The lava on the dayside would reflect radiation from the star, contributing to the overall observed temperature of the planet. Now, a deeper analysis of the same Spitzer data finds this planet likely has an atmosphere whose ingredients could be similar to those of Earth's atmosphere, but thicker. Lava lakes directly exposed to space without an atmosphere would create local hot spots of high temperatures, so they are not the best explanation for the Spitzer observations, scientists said."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7001">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers have introduced a new computing problem and shown that it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for a classical computer to solve, but in theory it could be efficiently solved using quantum techniques. The problem, which is called Gaussian boson sampling, is a new version of boson sampling, which is a similar computing problem that was introduced a few years ago with the goal of demonstrating the potential advantages of quantum computers over classical ones. The researchers of the new study, Craig S. Hamilton et al., from the Czech Technical University in Prague and the University of Paderborn in Germany, have published a paper on Gaussian boson sampling in a recent issue of Physical Review Letters. Overall, the Gaussian boson sampling problem is very similar to the original boson sampling problem, which was proposed in 2011 by Scott Aaronson and Alex Arkhipov. In both problems, the task is to find the probability of measuring certain patterns of photons emerging from an optical system, given a certain input configuration of photons. In complexity theory, boson sampling is conjectured to be a #P-hard problem, which makes it extremely unlikely that it could be solved by a classical computer."</em> <a href="https://phys.org/news/2017-11-hard-problem-solvable-quantum.html">[...]</a>

So it has long been a mystery how it is that certain marine organisms are able to form glass architectures (called spicules) in cold water. Now, a paper published recently in Science Advances by Professor Emil Zolotoyabko, of the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, and colleagues in Germany, headed by Dr. Igor Zlotnikov from TU Dresden, is helping to unravel that mystery. Using the most advanced X-ray methods, nano-tomography and focused X-ray diffraction, available at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France), the group uncovered the principles of spicule morphogenesis in certain kinds of marine sponges. Marine sponges are one of the oldest multicellular organisms, with a fossil record that stretches back more than half a billion years. Demospongiae and Hexactinellida, two classes of sponges, synthesize mineralized silica-based skeletal elements, called glass spicules, which provide the animals with structural support and mechanical strength and help protect them from their environment. The spicules are microns to millimeters long and exhibit a diversity of highly regular three-dimensional branched morphologies that are an example of symmetry in biological systems (Fig."</em> <a href="https://www.technion.ac.il/en/2017/11/marine-sponges-novel-glass-technology/">[...]</a>

Berry says the new structure that graduate student Jill Chipman created could lead to a breakthrough in quantam computing, an approach with such great potential that it could undermine today’s silicon-based supercomputers much as the telephone did the telegraph: A great leap forward that begins a slide into irrelevance. The presence and activity, or “spin,” of unpaired electrons sets the strength of a permanent magnet, so molecules with a high degree of spin are a desirable target for chemists. The unusually large spin in the new magnetic molecule, Berry explains, results from a “messenger electron” that shuttles between an unpaired electron at each end of the rod-shaped molecule and persuades all three of them to adopt the same spin. That agreement of spin, “orthogonality” in the jargon, adds strength to a permanent magnet."</em> <a href="https://news.wisc.edu/molecular-magnetism-packs-power-with-messenger-electron/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scientists at Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech) and McGill University have developed a new dye-free photoalignment method that enables 2D patterns of liquid crystals in one step by guiding nonpolarized light temporally and spatially on the photopolymerization process. This new method provides a pathway for the simple creation of highly functional organic materials such as flexible liquid crystal devices. With current 2D techniques, one typically irradiates a liquid crystal film that contains added photoresponsive dye molecules, with uniform polarized light. This controls the net liquid crystal alignment via the interaction of the dye dipole and the polarization axis of light. The drawback with these systems is the need for adding strong dyes, which can discolor or degrade optical and stability properties. Thus, a dye-free method is highly desired in the engineering industry."</em> <a href="https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/news/2017/039801.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A University of Tokyo research group has found that the superconductivity of materials in strongly correlated electron systems—that is, materials characterized by strong interactions between the electrons—can be enhanced beyond that achieved in thermal equilibrium by irradiation with a strong laser. The current findings hold promise of paving the way for research on regulating the superconductivity transition temperature with light, and applying the research toward developing new devices. Realizing superconductivity at room temperature is one of the Holy Grails of condensed matter physics. Although the highest critical temperature for superconductivity at ambient pressure was recorded in copper oxide superconductors (cuprates) at around minus 140 degrees Celsius decades ago, the situation has essentially remained the same despite multiple efforts to raise the temperature to within room-temperature range. One reason for this is that the strong attraction between electrons required for realizing a higher transition temperature drives the tendency to pull and clump electrons together into a nearby location, thereby forming an uneven spatial distribution of electrons, which suppresses superconductivity. In order to break through this stalemate in equilibrium, researchers have increasingly been utilizing nonequilibrium processes, such as laser irradiation, in recent years as a new way for regulating the transition temperature, and controlling and enhancing superconductivity in materials."</em> <a href="http://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/utokyo-research/research-news/method-for-enhancing-superconductivity-by-laser-irradiation.html">[...]</a>

Qubits, or quantum bits, are the key building blocks that lie at the heart of every quantum computer. In order to perform a computation, signals need to be directed to and from qubits. At the same time, these qubits are extremely sensitive to interference from their environment, and need to be shielded from unwanted signals, in particular from magnetic fields. It is thus a serious problem that the devices built to shield qubits from unwanted signals, known as nonreciprocal devices, are themselves producing magnetic fields."</em> <a href="http://ist.ac.at/nc/news-media/news/news-detail/article/essential-quantum-computer-component-downsized-by-two-orders-of-magnitude/6/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A unique class of engineered light-manipulating materials, known as metamaterials or structured materials, makes use of patterns of strongly interacting wavelength or sub-wavelength-sized elements. Because of these intricate internal and surface structures, new properties have emerged, some exhibiting behavior that has resulted in rewriting long-understood “laws” for how light and other electromagnetic (EM) waves interact with materials. These materials have been opening up new options for controlling EM waves in many technological arenas, among them imaging, thermal control, and frequency conversion. Specific applications include night-vision, heat reflection and management in aircraft engines, and temperature regulation of electronics on satellites in the hot-and-cold extremes of space. Although researchers have been taking steps toward putting these materials to practical use, they remain puzzled about the optimal structure designs for desired matter-light interactions.

<p><em>"The ability to trap and control electrons and other quasi-particles for the study of isolated single particles as well as many-body systems in a solid-state environment can be of major importance for understanding the behaviour of correlated electrons in technologically relevant materials. Because of their – compared to atoms – extremely small masses, these point-like particles are very fast and mobile. This, however, makes them hard to hold in place. Now, an international team of scientists around Prof. Ignacio Cirac (Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics, Garching), and Prof. Mikhail Lukin (Harvard University, USA) have investigated a new way of building a cage for electrons (Physical Review X 7, 24 October 2017). According to their proposal electrons can be moved or held in place by electric potentials that are generated by acoustic waves on the surfaces of piezoelectric materials. Furthermore, by using counterpropagating acoustic waves lattice structures similar to optical lattices for neutral atoms can be generated."</em> <a href="http://www.mpq.mpg.de/5580485/17_11_14?1510614000">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Manchester scientists use graphene water filter to turn whisky clear Previously graphene-oxide membranes were shown to be completely impermeable to all solvents except for water. However, a study published in Nature Materials, now shows that we can tailor the molecules that pass through these membranes by simply making them ultrathin. The research team led by Professor Rahul Nair at the National Graphene Institute and School of Chemical Engineering and Analytical Science at The University of Manchester tailored this membrane to allow all solvents to pass through but without compromising it’s ability to sieve out the smallest of particles. In the newly developed ultrathin membranes, graphene-oxide sheets are assembled in such a way that pinholes formed during the assembly are interconnected by graphene nanochannels, which produces an atomic-scale sieve allowing the large flow of solvents through the membrane. This new research allows for expansion in the applications of graphene based membranes from sea water desalination to organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN). Unlike sea water desalination, which separate salts from water, OSN technology separates charged or uncharged organic compounds from an organic solvent."</em> <a href="http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/graphene-water-filter-turns-whisky-clear/">[...]</a>

In perfectly frustrated magnets called spin liquids, the disordered magnetism of these materials persists even at very low temperatures, and their unique properties are of interest in the development of quantum computing and high-temperature superconductivity.

If you write your own code (as I do) updating each of these separately even via OTA (over the air) becomes a bit tedious. My own system, for example has 8x ESP-01S, 6x Wemos D1, 4x Sonoff Basic 12x Sonoff S20, 2x Sonoff SV and a NodeMCU which share a common code base, so that's 33 devices in all to update when I make a simple code change. But there is an easier way: An "update server". The excellent Arduino IDE + ESP8266 core has a library to do most of the work (ESP8266httpUpdate), but you need to know how to set up your own server to make it work. This Instructable shows you how using a NODE-RED server, but the same logic applies to any server technology of your choice e.g."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Set-Up-an-ESP8266-Automatic-Update-Server/">[...]</a>

I got an idea of making an outdoor weather station that would send measured light level, temperature and humidity to my home automation server. The ESP is a hungry beast when it’s doing WiFi. According to different sources on the internet it uses about 70 mA on average when WiFi is on! This would mean that I have to change batteries on my sensor quite some times every year. I instead came up with the idea of a design using an AtTiny85 for doing frequent measurements and then once in a while to wake up the ESP beast to transmit it’s recorded data to the server."</em> <a href="https://www.cron.dk/esp8266-on-batteries-for-years-part-1/">[...]</a>

I started out on breadboard which was a terrible mistake as I ended up needing two breadboards to provide enough space to run 16 LED’s via resistors all with a shared GND. Should have gone straight to perfboard (I think veroboard would have the same problem as breadboard due to solid tracks instead of pads). The shiftOut() function takes a bit of getting used to, especially when using two 74HC595 shift registers so need to output 16 bits instead of an 8-bit byte (and when it takes an hour of playing with code to realise one of the chip’s output pins it busted!) and for some reason when moving from breadboard to perfboard I had to change the code to use MSBFIRST instead of LSBFIRST or it would run the LED sequence on each chip instead of across the two…..?!
