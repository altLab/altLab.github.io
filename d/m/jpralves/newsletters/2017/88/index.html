Gillette</a>, este inventor Norte-Americano ficou mundialmente conhecido pela sua invenção da lâmina de barbear fina e descartável. Faz também anos hoje que nascia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wilkinson_(machinist)">David Wilkinson</a> em 1771 nos Estados Unidos. Ete engenheiro mecanico é responsável pela invenção do torno para fazer roscas de parafuso. Este invento foi particularmente importante no desenvolvimento da industria da maquinaria no inicio do século 19.</p>

<p>Nesta primeira semana de 2017, começou a CES 2017 em Las Vegas, e dela chegam novidades do Faraday Future. Este veículo eléctrico não teve a melhor estreia - não o conseguiram ligar, ainda assim poderá ser um concorrente interessante à Tesla. Foi identificado um novo orgão no corpoo humano - o mesentério. Graças ao trabalho de J. Calvin Coffey, um investigador da universidade do hospital de Limerick, na Irlanda, e ao fim de um estudo que durou mais de seis anos, cientistas acreditam agora que a estrutura é, na verdade, um órgão único e contínuo. Este órgão, que só agora é reconhecido, é uma dupla prega do peritoneu, que liga o intestino à parede do abdómen. Tem uma forma de leque, contém vasos sanguíneos, nervos e gânglios linfáticos. O Inkscape 0.92 foi finalmente lançado. Esta versão deste software open source trás novidades ao nivel do suporte SVG2 e CSS3 entre outras. O HDMI forum anunciou a versão 2.1 da especificação HDMI. Esta nova versão suporta HDR dinâmico, suporte para 8K a 60Hz e 4K a 120Hz, aumento da largura de banda para 48Gbps, entre outras.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como alguns modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis. É apresentado também um livro sobre Azure para programadores.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.livescience.com/57370-mesentery-new-organ-identified.html">Gut Decision: Scientists Identify New Organ in Humans</a></h2>

<p><em>"A mighty membrane that twists and turns through the gut is starting the new year with a new classification: the structure, called the mesentery, has been upgraded to an organ. Scientists have known about the structure, which connects a person's small and large intestines to the abdominal wall and anchors them in place, according to the Mayo Clinic. However, until now, it was thought of as a number of distinct membranes by most scientists. Interestingly, in one of its earliest descriptions, none other than Leonardo da Vinci identified the membranes as a single structure, according to a recent review."</em> <a href="http://www.livescience.com/57370-mesentery-new-organ-identified.html">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Searching for recurring patterns in network systems has become a fundamental part of research and discovery in fields as diverse as biology and social media. KAUST researchers have developed a pattern or graph-mining framework that promises to significantly speed up searches on massive network data sets. “A graph is a data structure that models complex relationships among objects,” explained Panagiotis Kalnis, leader of the research team from the KAUST Extreme Computing Research Center. “Graphs are widely used in many modern applications, including social networks, biological networks like protein-to-protein interactions, and communication networks like the internet.” In these applications, one of the most important operations is the process of finding recurring graphs that reveal how objects tend to connect to each other. The process, which is called frequent subgraph mining (FSM), is an essential building block of many knowledge extraction techniques in social studies, bioinformatics and image processing, as well as in security and fraud detection. However, graphs may contain hundreds of millions of objects and billions of relationships, which means that extracting recurring patterns places huge demands on time and computing resources."</em> <a href="https://discovery.kaust.edu.sa/en/article/297/divide-and-conquer-pattern-searching">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Over the past several years, Jack Gallant’s neuroscience lab has produced a string of papers that sound absurd. In 2011, the lab showed it was possible to recreate movie clips just from observing the brain activity of people watching movies. Using a computer to regenerate the images of a film just by scanning the brain of a person watching one is, in a sense, mind reading. Similarly, in 2015, Gallant’s team of scientists predicted which famous paintings people were picturing in their minds by observing the activity of their brains. This year, the team announced in the journal Nature that they had created an “atlas” of where 10,000-plus individual words reside in the brain — just by having study participants listen to podcasts. How did they do all this? By using machine learning tools — a type of artificial intelligence — to mine huge troves of brain data and find the patterns of brain activity that predict our perception. The goal here isn’t to build a mind-reading machine (although it’s often confused for that). Neuroscientists aren’t interested in stealing your passwords right out of your head. Nor are they interested in your darkest secrets. The real goal is a lot bigger. By turning neuroscience into a “big data” science, and using machine learning to mine that data, Gallant and others in the field have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the brain."</em> <a href="http://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2016/12/29/13967966/machine-learning-neuroscience">[...]</a></p>

In a project funded by electronics giant Samsung, a team of Penn State materials scientists and electrical engineers has designed a mechanical energy transducer based on flexible organic ionic diodes that points toward a new direction in scalable energy harvesting of unused mechanical energy in the environment, including wind, ocean waves and human motion. Devices to harvest ambient mechanical energy to convert to electricity are widely used to power wearable electronics, biomedical devices and the so-called Internet of Things (IoT) -- everyday objects that wirelessly connect to the internet. The most common of these devices, based on the piezoelectric effect, operate most efficiently at high frequency, greater than 10 vibrations per second.

A team at Hewlett Packard Labs, in Palo Alto, Calif., has built a demonstration chip that could help push some particularly thorny computations into the realm of light, potentially boosting speed and saving energy in the process. Silicon integrated circuits containing parts that can manipulate light are not new. But this chip, which integrates 1,052 optical components, is the biggest and most complex in which all the photonic components work together to perform a computation, says team member Dave Kielpinski, a senior research scientist at Hewlett Packard Labs (now a part of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, or HPE). “We believe that it is by a wide margin,” he says. The chip, which was developed through the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Mesodynamic Architectures­ program and was still undergoing testing as IEEE Spectrum went to press, is an implementation of an Ising machine—an approach to computation that could potentially solve some problems, such as the infamous “traveling salesman problem,” faster than conventional computers can."</em> <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/processors/hpes-new-chip-marks-a-milestone-in-optical-computing">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"It looks like the age of silicon may be coming to a close. Technological giant IBM wants to try using carbon nanotubes in chip design instead. Their emerging research on creating and manipulating these nanoscale structures could be the key to success. Moore's Law has proved constant in the semiconductor industry, providing hope for more powerful computers. The law states that the number of transistors on a silicon chip doubles every 18 months, hence producing devices twice as powerful (typically). If a computer is slow today, never fear because just beyond the horizon is a new processor that could speed up computing significantly. Well, Moore’s Law may finally come to an end in 2020 which means beyond the horizon may be a processor that is only slightly better or cheaper. So how will modern computing keep up with power demand? What alternatives exist for such a computational problem? Some solutions seem rather simple while others are more exotic in nature. For example, to squeeze the most out of silicon may require a blast from the past with programmers aiming for optimization above all else. Object orientated programming is great for program creation but uses large amounts of resources—so programmers may shift to using assembly for routines that require speed. More efficient algorithms could also help with CPU efficiency as well as freeing up CPU resources for other operations."</em> <a href="http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/news/how-carbon-nanotubes-could-help-replace-silicon-in-chip-fabrication/">[...]</a></p>

Writing in the January 2017 edition of the journal Micromachines, Missouri S&amp;T researchers assess the current state of the emerging field of stretchable electronics, focusing on a type of conductor that can be built on or set into the surface of a polymer known as elastomer. These conductors could one day replace the rigid, brittle circuit board that powers many of today’s electronic devices. They could be used, for example, as wearable sensors that adhere to the skin to monitor heart rate or brain activity, as sensors in clothing or as thin solar panels that could be plastered onto curved surfaces."</em> <a href="http://news.mst.edu/2017/01/additive-manufacturing-a-new-twist-for-stretchable-electronics/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"The new UB20M voltage detector IC in Fig. 1 allows circuit designers to eliminate standby power, to develop circuits that perform continuous monitoring without using battery power, and to implement wireless wake-up. The device is a sensor-driven circuit that requires no power rail. When the input voltage rises to a typical threshold of 0.65 V, the voltage detector triggers an open-drain output, which activates a switch, as illustrated in Fig. 2. This allows the powering up of sub-systems. The voltage detector meets five criteria which allow it to be sensor-driven, see Fig. 2. Its input is rugged and survives 20 V without using traditional protection circuits that would clamp the signal, and thereby affect the data or power in the signal. The threshold is low at 0.65 V, to provide sufficient sensitivity (we also have lower threshold variants). The sensor uses only a few pA from the sensor, thereby permitting the use of conventional sensors, rather than more powerful and bulky energy harvesters. The detector is suitable for input signals with input voltage gradients from 0 to 10V/ms. At gradients higher than 10V/ms, the threshold increases. Detection hysteresis prevents output oscillations."</em> <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/research/em/research/zero-standby-power/">[...]</a></p>

Kandybot is powered by Firebase and Kandy.io. There are two main things we need to make an Internet-controlled robot. First is to control the robot movements and gripper in real-time; second is to transmit video from the Kandybot to the Internet. To control the movements of bot in real-time, we are using Firebase Realtime Database. And to transmit livestream video, we are using Kandy.io. We are using two Android phones both are connected to Kandy.io and Firebase. One phone is directly installed onto the robot's head (let's call it "Kandy mobile"), and the other is used as a controller which can be used anywhere by virtue of being connected to the Internet (let's call it "Controller Mobile"). Suppose the user presses the forward movement button, the message will be sent to the Firebase Realtime Database. Kandy mobile is also connected to this database, therefore it will know the user pressed the forward movement button. Kandy mobile will control the movement by sending a Bluetooth message to the Arduino. After receiving the message from Bluetooth, the Arduino controls the motors."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/tejas-ozarkar/kandybot-b84ef3">[...]</a></p>

This DIY game buzzer uses the SparkFun RedBoard connected to four momentary push buttons—each representing a player or team: red, yellow, green and blue. There is an LED for each team in its corresponding color and one speaker. When your game night host asks a question, each team has the opportunity to buzz in. When the first team pushes its button, the corresponding LED will light up for five seconds and a unique tone will play on the speaker for one second. There will also be an indication on the serial monitor as to which team succeeded in buzzing in first. Once the first team manages to press its button, the rest of the players or teams become “locked out” for five seconds so there is no confusion regarding who hit the button first!"</em> <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/news/2268">[...]</a></p>

Just as the Earth orbits the Sun, so too the Moon orbits the Earth. The Moon is tidally locked to the Earth, which means that because the Moon completes its own rotation in the same time it take to orbit around the Earth, we always see the same side of the Moon. While we may be stuck to the same view of the Moon, the relationship between the Earth and Sun as the Moon completes its orbit is constantly changing. This means that it will be illuminated to varying degrees (or not at all!) and will take on a distinct shape. These distinct shapes are what we refer to as the lunar phases.

To explain it in a simple example: you want to increase a temperature of the water to be about 60 degree Celsius,With a relay when you reach to 60 degree Celsius,the relay turn off the Heater, that makes the temperature decrease rapidly so the relay will turn on and increase temperature rapidly again , so the relay will turn on-off within a short time which will damage the relay and maybe damage the heater it self. Best way to adjust the temperature by control AC voltage output applied on AC heater. build a (crappy) AC triac circuit not just unprofessional but also will not work well,With inappropriate heatsink,no protection from ac short circuit or overload current, and most important no protection for you,any small fault might kill you,be careful.

<p><em>"AC line detector is a device which detects AC line currents without making any electrical connections to the line. An easy to make circuit to identify the line and the neutral of an AC circuit, without making contact with the wires. Now I am going to instruct how to make an AC line detector with less number of components.

<p><em>"Smartphones are an integral part of our everyday lives, but remember when they were not so smart? Those golden days when push-button monochrome LCD screened phones did little more than call? I'm sure a lot of us still have some of those old dumb phones lying around. And you're probably wondering...what can I do with it now? What if I told you that you could turn that old cell phone into a smartwatch!?! Keep reading to find out how! Not much for reading?

<p><em>"The goal of the project was to create a robotic hand that is controlled by sensing the muscular contractions in the arm of the user and to replicate the movements on the robotic hand. Electrodes will be placed on multiple areas on the arm of the user, and will sense the voltage differences of the muscles as they contract. The signal will be fed into a circuit which amplifies and filters the signal. The resulting signal will then be sent into the PIC32 microcontroller which will analyze the readings. An algorithm then decides which fingers should be moved and uses servos attached to each finger of the hand to move the fingers."</em> <a href="http://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/FinalProjects/f2016/mh2298_jyh37_sv376/mh2298_jyh37_sv376/mh2298_jyh37_sv376/index.html">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"I've been looking for a solution to open my automatic garage door for family and trusted friends when im not home, without having to hide a remote outside in the flowerpot. My first thought was to buy a remote keypad, but i just couldn't pay 50USD for something that ugly. Take a look at it and you'll probably feel the same. So since i bought this nodemcu (esp8266 devboard) that I've been trying out blinking leds and what not, it might as well be put to good use. Fortunately, I got three remotes delivered for my garage door opener, but I only use one on a daily basis, so one of those could be used for this task. This is a very simple DIY-hack and i belive most beginners will get a good result."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Garage-Door-Opener-Remote-Web-interface-With-Esp82/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"This is a story about making an pocket carry-able USB stick like IR Thermometer made using Arduino programming and some other stuffs. The device will also have Stop Watch function, Kitchen Timer &amp; Inactivity Tracker function. IR Thermometer is a IR radiation based temperature sensing device, which allows to measure the average temperature of a surface it's facing most probably with Wien's displacement law or Stefan–Boltzmann law from highs school physics. Stop Watch is basically a basic time measurement device used in sports, scientific experiment to measure lapsed time. Today hardware Stop Watch (analogy type) are kind of extinct and replaced by so called smartphone app. Kitchen Timer is a device that alerts cook by buzzing alarm that something getting cooked needs checking. Inactivity Tracker is a periodic timer that alerts a person to move his ass after every certain period of time. This helps one to get a minute break from idle state and practice healthy life."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/PSoC_Rocks/ir-thermometer-stopwatch-cooking-timer-inactivity-tracker-72664b">[...]</a></p>
