<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1601, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_de_Fermat">Pierre de Fermat</a>. Este matemático francês foi chamado o fundador da teoria moderna dos números. Em conjunto com Rene Descartes, Fermat foi um dos dois principais matemáticos da primeira metade do século XVII. Ele antecipou o cálculo diferencial com seu método de encontrar as maiores e menos ordenadas de linhas curvas. Ele propôs o famoso Teorema de Fermat, também conhecido como conjectura de Fermat, ao estudar o trabalho do antigo matemático grego Diophantus. Ele escreveu a lápis na margem da uma cópia do livro 'Arithmetica': "Descobri uma prova verdadeiramente notável mas esta margem é muito pequena para a conter", que quando o teorema pitagórico é alterado para ler an + bn = cn, a nova equação não pode ser resolvida em números inteiros para qualquer valor de n superior a 2. Este teorema seria demonstrado apenas em 1994 por Andrew Wiles após 358 anos de esforços por parte dos matemáticos.
Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1893, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Noddack">Walter Noddack</a>. Este químico alemão, conjuntamente com Ida Tacke e Otto Berg foram responsáveis pela descoberta do elemento 43, o Tecnécio, e do elemento 75, o Rénio da tabela periodica em 1925. O Rénio foi nomeado em honra ao rio Reno e foi o último elemento estável a ser descoberto.</p>

<p>Esta semana ficámos a saber que a Sony apresentou uma placa de desenvolvimento para IoT compatível com o Arduino. Designada por Spritzer foi apresentada durante a Maker Faire Tóquio no Japão, de 5 a 6 de Agosto. A placa Spritzer foi projectada especificamente para aplicações IoT e inclui uma gama de funcionalidades inteligentes, como GPS integrado e um codec e amplificador de áudio digital avançado.
Também esta semana a Hewlett Packard Enterprise enviou para o espaço  um supercomputador para acelerar a missão a Marte. O foguetão SpaceX CRS-12, desenvolvido pela SpaceX de Elon Musk, foi lançada do Kennedy Space Center, na Flórida, enviando a Dragon Spacecraft para o Laboratório Nacional da Estação Espacial Internacional (ISS). A bordo do Dragon foi um supercomputador HPE. Este supercomputador, chamado Spaceborne Computer, faz parte de uma experiência de um ano realizada pela HPE e pela NASA para utilizar um sistema informático de alto desempenho comercial (COTS) no espaço, coisa que nunca foi feita antes. O objectivo é que o sistema funcione perfeitamente nas duras condições do espaço durante um ano - aproximadamente o tempo que levará uma viajem até Marte.
Esta semana foi o 24º aniversário da Debian. O Debian é um sistema operativo gratuito (SO) para o computador. O Debian GNU/Linux 9 suporta dez arquitecturas principais e várias variações de cada arquitectura conhecidas como "flavours".
O Raspbian Stretch chegou ao Raspberry PI. Menos de dois anos após o lançamento da versão Jessie do Raspbian. Esta versão alinha-se com a ultima versão do Debian. As diferenças entre o Jessie e o Stretch são principalmente optimizações under-the-hood.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como um modelo 3D que poderá ser útil.</p>

<h2><a href="https://developer.sony.com/2017/08/03/sony-introduces-smart-sensing-iot-board-arduino-compatible/">Sony introduces smart sensing IoT board (Arduino-compatible)</a></h2>

<p><em>"Sony will be showcasing a brand new development board called Spritzer during the Maker Faire Tokyo in Japan, August 5-6. The Spritzer board is specifically designed for IoT applications and comprises a range of smart functionality such as integrated GPS and an advanced digital audio codec and amplifier. Being Arduino-compatible means that Spritzer allows any developer to easily get started with app development using the free Arduino IDE and an ordinary USB cable. The Spritzer board features a processing chip with a unique combination of low power consumption and a rapid clock speed of 156MHz. This makes Spritzer extremely versatile and can be deployed for a vast range of use cases. During the Maker Faire, Sony will demonstrate various live implementations such as a drone utilizing the GPS and the 6-axis sensor support, a smart speaker utilizing the audio functions, a self-driving line-tracing miniature car, and a low-power smart sensing IoT camera using the camera interface of Spritzer. The Spritzer board is planned to be available for developers in early 2018. If you want to make sure to be notified when it’s available, either check in here on Sony Developer World or follow us on Twitter @SonyDevWorld. If you plan to visit the Maker Faire in Tokyo, you’re most welcome to come by the Sony booth #S-10-05."</em> <a href="https://developer.sony.com/2017/08/03/sony-introduces-smart-sensing-iot-board-arduino-compatible/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"On August 14, 2017, the SpaceX CRS-12 rocket, developed by Elon Musk’s SpaceX, intends to launch from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, sending its Dragon Spacecraft to the International Space Station (ISS) National Lab. Aboard the Dragon is a HPE supercomputer. This supercomputer, called the Spaceborne Computer, is part of a year-long experiment conducted by HPE and NASA to run a high performance commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) computer system in space, which has never been done before. The goal is for the system to operate seamlessly in the harsh conditions of space for one year – roughly the amount of time it will take to travel to Mars. Many of the calculations needed for space research projects are still done on Earth due to the limited computing capabilities in space, which creates a challenge when transmitting data to and from space. While this approach works for space exploration on the moon or in low Earth orbit (LEO) when astronauts can be in near real-time communication with Earth, once they travel farther out and closer to Mars, they will experience larger communication latencies. This could mean it would take up to 20 minutes for communications to reach Earth and then another 20 minutes for responses to reach astronauts. Such a long communication lag would make any on-the-ground exploration challenging and potentially dangerous if astronauts are met with any mission critical scenarios that they’re not able to solve themselves. A mission to Mars will require sophisticated onboard computing resources that are capable of extended periods of uptime. To meet these requirements, we need to improve technology’s viability in space in order to better ensure mission success. By sending a supercomputer to space, HPE is taking the first step in that direction. Future phases of this experiment will eventually involve sending other new technologies and advanced computing systems, like Memory-Driven Computing, to the ISS once we learn more about how the Spaceborne Computer reacts in space."</em> <a href="https://news.hpe.com/hewlett-packard-enterprise-sends-supercomputer-into-space-to-accelerate-mission-to-mars/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Spacewalking cosmonauts set free the world's first satellite made almost entirely with a 3-D printer on Thursday. In total, Russians Fyodor Yurchikhin and Sergey Ryazanskiy ended up releasing five nanosatellites by hand. One by one, the tiny craft — no more than 1 to 2 feet in size — tumbled safely away from the International Space Station. The exterior casing of the first one tossed overboard was made with a 3-D printer. So were the battery packs inside. Researchers want to see how 3-D-made parts weather the space environment. The 3-D satellite contains regular electronics. It also holds greetings to planet Earth in a variety of languages, courtesy of students at Siberia's Tomsk Polytechnic University, where the satellite was made. The other satellites deployed Thursday have traditional spacecraft parts. Each weighs just 10 to 24 pounds. They're expected to orbit for five to six months. One commemorates the 60th anniversary of the world's first satellite, Sputnik 1, launched Oct. 4, 1957, by the Soviet Union. Another pays tribute to Russia's father of rocketry, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky. He was born 160 years ago next month. The remaining two small satellites involve navigation and other experiments. Yurchikhin and Ryazanskiy completed the satellite releases within an hour of venturing outside. Barely a minute passed between a few of the launches. The rest of the chores took longer than expected, however, and Russia's Mission Control outside Moscow sent the planned six-hour spacewalk into overtime."</em> <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/spacewalking-cosmonauts-release-printed-satellite-49273568">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Chip makers appreciate what most consumers never knew: silicon’s virtues include the fact that it “rusts” in a way that insulates its tiny circuitry. Two new ultrathin materials share that trait  and outdo silicon in other ways that make them promising materials for electronics of the future. The next generation of feature-filled and energy-efficient electronics will require computer chips just a few atoms thick. For all its positive attributes, trusty silicon can’t take us to these ultrathin extremes. Now, electrical engineers at Stanford have identified two semiconductors – hafnium diselenide and zirconium diselenide – that share or even exceed some of silicon’s desirable traits, starting with the fact that all three materials can “rust.” “It’s a bit like rust, but a very desirable rust,” said Eric Pop, an associate professor of electrical engineering, who co-authored with post-doctoral scholar Michal Mleczko a paper that appears in the journal Science Advances. The new materials can also be shrunk to functional circuits just three atoms thick and they require less energy than silicon circuits. Although still experimental, the researchers said the materials could be a step toward the kinds of thinner, more energy-efficient chips demanded by devices of the future."</em> <a href="http://news.stanford.edu/2017/08/11/new-ultrathin-semiconductor-materials-exceed-silicons-secret-powers/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.uni-muenster.de/news/view.php?cmdid=9045&amp;lang=en">Chemists of the University of Münster develope a new method for the formation of fluorinated molecular rings</a></h2>

<p><em>"Dyes, pharmaceuticals, and functional materials – all of these products are generally based on innovative molecules made by chemists. For their production several chemical reactions are available to the expert, however, limitations remain. For example, fluorinated compounds, molecules that contain at least one fluorine atom, are often rather difficult to prepare. This is unfortunate, since they exhibit interesting chemical properties and are of greatest importance for the development of active ingredients. Thus, new ways have to be found to produce these compounds. Now, chemists from the Westfälische Wilhems-Universität (WWU) made the impossible possible: they have developed a new and practical synthetic method for the formation of such fluorinated three-dimensional “saturated” (meaning only single-bond containing) molecular ring structures. The report of Prof. Dr. Frank Glorius, Mario Wiesenfeldt, Dr. Zackaria Nairoukh and Dr. Wei Li has just been published online in the learned journal “Science“."</em> <a href="https://www.uni-muenster.de/news/view.php?cmdid=9045&amp;lang=en">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.anl.gov/articles/scientists-find-new-method-control-electronic-properties-nanocrystals">Scientists find new method to control electronic properties of nanocrystals</a></h2>

<p><em>"Researchers from The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Stony Brook University, and the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Brookhaven National Laboratory have discovered new effects of an important method for modulating semiconductors. The method, which works by creating open spaces or “vacancies” in a material’s structure, enables scientists to tune the electronic properties of semiconductor nanocrystals (SCNCs)—semiconductor particles that are smaller than 100 nanometers. This finding will advance the development of new technologies like smart windows, which can change opaqueness on demand. Scientists use a technique called “chemical doping” to control the electronic properties of semiconductors. In this process, chemical impurities—atoms from different materials—are added to a semiconductor in order to alter its electrical conductivity. Though it is possible to dope SCNCs, it is very difficult due to their tiny size. The amount of impurities added during chemical doping is so small that in order to dope a nanocrystal properly, no more than a few atoms can be added to the crystal. Nanocrystals also tend to expel impurities, further complicating the doping process. Seeking to control the electronic properties of SCNCs more easily, researchers studied a technique called vacancy formation. In this method, impurities are not added to the semiconductor; instead, vacancies in its structure are formed by oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions, a type of chemical reaction where electrons are transferred between two materials. During this transfer, a type of doping occurs as missing electrons, called holes, become free to move throughout the structure of the crystal, significantly altering the electrical conductivity of the SCNC. “We have also identified size effects in the efficiency of the vacancy formation doping reaction,” said Uri Banin, a nanotechnologist from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. “Vacancy formation is actually more efficient in larger SCNCs.” In this study, the researchers investigated a redox reaction between copper sulfide nanocrystals (the semiconductor) and iodine, a chemical introduced in order to influence the redox reaction to occur."</em> <a href="https://www.anl.gov/articles/scientists-find-new-method-control-electronic-properties-nanocrystals">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Give your medicine a jolt. By using a technique that combines electricity and chemistry, future pharmaceuticals – including many of the top prescribed medications in the United States – soon may be easily scaled up to be manufactured in a more sustainable way. This new Cornell research appears in Science Aug. 11. Currently, making pharmaceuticals involves creating complex organic molecules that require several chemical steps and intense energy. The process also spawns copious amounts of environmentally harmful – and usually toxic – waste. At the heart of many popular pharmaceuticals are vicinal diamines, which contain carbon-nitrogen chemical bonds, a bioactive foundation for the medicine. According to Song Lin, assistant professor of chemistry, many widely consumed therapeutic agents have these diamines, including prescription-strength flu medicines, penicillin and some anti-cancer drugs. To synthesize diamines, chemists have to employ oxidation and reduction reactions that reconfigure molecules, atoms and ions. It’s an energy-intensive and chemically wasteful process. Despite technical advances, a broadly applicable approach to diamine synthesis remained elusive, Lin said. But the laborious tasks and chemical squander can go away. Lin and his team have developed a technique that creates vicinal diamines more easily and without the toxic waste. The process uses electricity and chemistry – electrochemistry – and then employs Earth-abundant manganese."</em> <a href="http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2017/08/chemists-use-electricity-amp-drug-manufacturing">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Today, the desired book, toy or household appliance can be purchased by a click only – thanks to online mail order business and smart logistics. The bottleneck in logistics, however, is the high-bay store, where many picking and detection processes cannot yet be executed automatically by robots. At the Amazon Robotics Challenge in Nagoya, Japan, the IFL PiRo team of KIT demonstrated how future warehousing may work. First participation in the international competition was crowned by an excellent 7th place in the overall ranking. “In an exciting week with three intensive competition days we mastered several challenges and learned a lot,” says Kai Markert of KIT’s Institute for Materials Handling and Logistics and IFL PiRo team captain. “It was a big success for our young team to be able to compete with the best in the world in Japan.” The IFL PiRo team presented with an innovative shelf concept. Instead of arranging the goods in a conventional shelf, the objects are placed in mobile boxes arranged horizontally around the central robot arm. Some of the boxes can be moved by the robot like drawers, thus allowing for a multistorey arrangement. Although load capacity of this system appears to be smaller than that of a shelf system of the same area at first glance, the capacity can be increased easily. In the future warehouse, a second robot might work as a feeder and bring the required boxes or remove those that are no longer needed. “As today’s warehouse systems have reached their technical limits, we wanted to develop a completely new system for the 21st century in order to make full use of the advantages of the robot gripper,” Markert points out."</em> <a href="https://www.kit.edu/kit/english/pi_2017_109_when-robots-help-with-shopping.php">[...]</a>

The computer automatically sources and processes associated words and images required for the novel mind reading card trick which is performed by a magician.

The computer is able to assist in a creative task by taking over some of the workload during the design of the trick and by acting as an aid to prompt further creativity as it can uncover suggestions the magician may not have considered.

<p><em>"Rapid improvement in DNA sequencing has sparked a proliferation of medical and genetic tests that promise to reveal everything from one’s ancestry to fitness levels to microorganisms that live in your gut. A new study from University of Washington researchers that analyzed the security hygiene of common, open-source DNA processing programs finds evidence of poor computer security practices used throughout the field. In the study, which will be presented Aug. 17 in Vancouver, B.C., at the 26th USENIX Security Symposium, the team also demonstrated for the first time that it is possible — though still challenging — to compromise a computer system with a malicious computer code stored in synthetic DNA. When that DNA is analyzed, the code can become executable malware that attacks the computer system running the software. So far, the researchers stress, there’s no evidence of malicious attacks on DNA synthesizing, sequencing and processing services. But their analysis of software used throughout that pipeline found known security gaps that could allow unauthorized parties to gain control of computer systems — potentially giving them access to personal information or even the ability to manipulate DNA results. “One of the big things we try to do in the computer security community is to avoid a situation where we say, ‘Oh shoot, adversaries are here and knocking on our door and we’re not prepared,’” said co-author Tadayoshi Kohno, professor at the UW’s Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science &amp; Engineering. “Instead, we’d rather say, ‘Hey, if you continue on your current trajectory, adversaries might show up in 10 years. So let’s start a conversation now about how to improve your security before it becomes an issue,’” said Kohno, whose previous research has provoked high-profile discussions about vulnerabilities in emerging technologies, such as internet-connected automobiles and implantable medical devices."</em> <a href="http://www.washington.edu/news/2017/08/10/dna-sequencing-tools-lack-robust-protections-against-cybersecurity-risks/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"USB connections, the most common interface used globally to connect external devices to computers, are vulnerable to information ‘leakage’, making them even less secure than has been thought, Australian research has shown. University of Adelaide researchers tested more than 50 different computers and external USB hubs and found that over 90% of them leaked information to an external USB device. The results are being presented at the USENIX Security Symposium in Vancouver, Canada next week. “USB-connected devices include keyboards, cardswipers and fingerprint readers which often send sensitive information to the computer,” says project leader Dr Yuval Yarom, Research Associate with the University of Adelaide’s School of Computer Science. “It has been thought that because that information is only sent along the direct communication path to the computer, it is protected from potentially compromised devices. “But our research showed that if a malicious device or one that’s been tampered with is plugged into adjacent ports on the same external or internal USB hub, this sensitive information can be captured. That means keystrokes showing passwords or other private information can be easily stolen.” Dr Yarom says this ‘channel-to-channel crosstalk leakage’ is analogous with water leaking from pipes. “Electricity flows like water along pipes – and it can leak out,” he says. “In our project, we showed that voltage fluctuations of the USB port’s data lines can be monitored from the adjacent ports on the USB hub.” The leak was discovered by University of Adelaide student Yang Su, in the School of Computer Science, in collaboration with Dr Daniel Genkin (University of Pennsylvania and University of Maryland) and Dr Damith Ranasinghe (Auto-ID Lab, University of Adelaide). They used a modified cheap novelty plug-in lamp with a USB connector to “read” every key stroke from the adjacent keyboard USB interface.

<h2><a href="http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/news/5459">Fantasy football managers to compete with advanced AI engine in new Premier League season</a></h2>

<p><em>"A team of artificial intelligence (AI) experts from Electronics and Computer Science at the University of Southampton is challenging fantasy football managers across the world to take on their fiercely competitive machine learning algorithm. Associate Professor Dr Sarvapali (Gopal) Ramchurn claims that his system, known as Squadguru, consistently outperforms millions of players in the popular the Fantasy Premier League game by tapping into the latest AI techniques. Last year, more than four million players around the world competed in the English Fantasy Premier League, tinkering with their squads to generate maximum points from their teams. In the game, shrewd dealings in the transfer market can make or break teams’ seasons and entrants scramble week on week to strengthen their sides as Premier Leagues stars go on and off the boil. Squadguru has been tested on player data from previous seasons and produced teams which would have consistently ranked in the top one per cent of the Fantasy Premier League. Last season, a Squadguru generated team placed in the global top 60,000 of the game for most of the 38 gameweeks out of the millions of players. “From Elon Musk to Stephen Hawking, everyone’s talking about AI taking over the world - is that now also true for Fantasy Football?” Gopal asks. “Come and take on the best AI engine for fantasy football, and see if you can beat the Squadguru!” Fantasy managers can compete with Squadguru’s AI-fuelled 11 in a ‘Challenge the Squadguru’ league which is available in the free Fantasy Premier League game by entering league code 2917382-677658. The Squadguru system was built using two steps. The first harnessed Bayesian Machine Learning techniques and five years of past football data to create and train a predictive model which forecasts the outcome of future matches and, more crucially, the performance of individual players. They next created a combinatorial optimisation algorithm which worked out the best transfers to make given the allowed budget and other constraints on teams that can be formed. Gopal, a member of the University of Southampton’s Agents, Interaction and Complexity (AIC) research group, co-developed the algorithm with Dr Tim Matthews as part of his MSc project. This resulted in a publication at the world’s top AI conference back in 2012. Over the last five years, they have made significant improvements to the Squadguru and offered it as a free service for visitors to fantasyfootballfirst.co.uk. The system’s algorithms have been used to provide transfer advice to over 30,000 subscribers and helped optimise human teams’ performance."</em> <a href="http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/news/5459">[...]</a>

Devices known as supercapacitors are one way to achieve this. A supercapacitor acts similarly to a battery but allows for rapid charging which can fully charge devices in seconds.Now a solid-state flexible supercapacitor device has been demonstrated by using conductive graphene-oxide ink to print onto cotton fabric. As reported in the journal 2D Materials the printed electrodes exhibited excellent mechanical stability due to the strong interaction between the ink and textile substrate.Further development of graphene-oxide printed supercapacitors could turn the vast potential of wearable technology into the norm. High-performance sportswear that monitors performance, embedded health-monitoring devices, lightweight military gear, new classes of mobile communication devices and even wearable computers are just some of the applications that could become available following further research and development.To power these new wearable devices, the energy storage system must have reasonable mechanical flexibility in addition to high energy and power density, good operational safety, long cycling life and be low cost."</em> <a href="http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/flexible-batteries-power-the-future-of-wearable-technology/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers at BYU are the first to 3D-print a viable microfluidic device small enough to be effective at a scale much less than 100 micrometers. Microfluidic devices are tiny chips that can sort out disease biomarkers, cells and other small structures in samples like blood by using microscopic channels incorporated into the devices. The accomplishment, which is a major breakthrough toward mass-producing the medical diagnostic devices cheaply, is detailed in the latest issue of the academic journal Lab on a Chip. Researchers Greg Nordin, a BYU electrical engineering professor, and Adam Woolley, a BYU chemistry professor, say the key to their innovation was two-fold: Building their own 3D printer to print at a much higher resolution; Using a new, specifically designed, low-cost, custom resin. “Others have 3D-printed fluidic channels, but they haven’t been able to make them small enough for microfluidics,” Nordin said. “So we decided to make our own 3D printer and research a resin that could do it.” Their work has produced labs on a chip with flow channel cross sections as small as 18 micrometers by 20 micrometers. Previous efforts to 3D-print microfluidic devices have failed to achieve success smaller than 100 micrometers. The researchers’ 3D printer uses a 385 nm LED, which dramatically increases the available selection of UV absorbers for resin formulation compared to 3D printers with 405 nm LEDs. Nordin said the advantages of 3D printing for microfluidic device fabrication are already well-known and that their method, digital light processing stereolithography (DLP-SLA), is an especially promising lower-cost approach. DLP-SLA uses a micromirror array chip, like those in most consumer projectors, to dynamically create the optical pattern for each layer during layer-by-layer printing of a device."</em> <a href="https://news.byu.edu/news/professors-3d-print-first-truly-microfluidic-lab-chip-device">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign have developed technology that enables a smartphone to perform lab-grade medical diagnostic tests that typically require large, expensive instruments. Costing only $550, the spectral transmission-reflectance-intensity (TRI)-Analyzer from Bioengineering and Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering Professor Brian Cunningham’s lab attaches to a smartphone and analyzes patient blood, urine, or saliva samples as reliably as clinic-based instruments that cost thousands of dollars. “Our TRI Analyzer is like the Swiss Army knife of biosensing,” said Cunningham, the Donald Biggar Willett Professor of Engineering and director of the Micro + Nanotechnology Lab at Illinois. “It’s capable of performing the three most common types of tests in medical diagnostics, so in practice, thousands of already-developed tests could be adapted to it.” In a recently published paper, Cunningham’s team used the TRI Analyzer to perform two commercially available assays—a test to detect a biomarker associated with pre-term birth in pregnant women and the PKU test for newborns to indirectly detect an enzyme essential for normal growth and development. Their tests results were comparable to those acquired with clinic-grade spectrometer instrumentation. “The TRI Analyzer is more of a portable laboratory than a specialized device,” said Kenny Long, an MD/PhD student and lead author of the research study. Among the many diagnostic tests that can be adapted to their point-of-care smartphone format, Long said, is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which detects and measures a wide variety of proteins and antibodies in blood and is commonly used for a wide range of health diagnostics tests. The system is capable of detecting the output of any test that uses a liquid that changes color, or a liquid that generates light output (such as from fluorescent dyes). The TRI Analyzer operates by converting the smartphone camera into a high-performance spectrometer. Specifically, the analyzer illuminates a sample fluid with the phone’s internal white LED flash or with an inexpensive external green laser diode. The light from the sample is collected in an optical fiber and guided through a diffraction grating into the phone’s rear-facing internal camera. These optical components are all arranged within a 3D-printed plastic cradle. The TRI Analyzer can simultaneously measure multiple samples by using a microfluidic cartridge that slides through an opening in the back of the cradle. This ability to analyze multiple samples quickly and reliably makes the Analyzer suitable for patients who lack convenient access to a clinic or hospital with diagnostic test facilities or for patients with urgent health situations requiring rapid results."</em> <a href="http://bioengineering.illinois.edu/news/article/23435">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A new featherweight, flame-resistant and super-elastic “metamaterial” has been shown to combine high strength with electrical conductivity and thermal insulation, suggesting potential applications from buildings to aerospace. The composite combines nanolayers of a ceramic called aluminum oxide with graphene, which is an extremely thin sheet of carbon. Although both the ceramic and graphene are brittle, the new metamaterial has a honeycomb microstructure that provides super-elasticity and structural robustness. Metamaterials are engineered with features, patterns or elements on the scale of nanometers, or billionths of a meter, providing new properties for various potential applications. Graphene would ordinarily degrade when exposed to high temperature, but the ceramic imparts high heat tolerance and flame-resistance, properties that might be useful as a heat shield for aircraft. The light weight, high-strength and shock-absorbing properties could make the composite a good substrate material for flexible electronic devices and “large strain sensors.” Because it has high electrical conductivity and yet is an excellent thermal insulator, it might be used as a flame-retardant, thermally insulating coating, as well as sensors and devices that convert heat into electricity, said Gary Cheng, an associate professor in the School of Industrial Engineering at Purdue University. “This material is lighter than a feather,” he said. “The density is really low. It has a very high strength-to-weight ratio.” Findings were detailed in a research paper published on May 29 in the journal Advanced Materials. The paper was a collaboration between Purdue, Lanzhou University and the Harbin Institute of Technology, both in China, and the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory."</em> <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2017/Q3/super-light-material-possesses-high-strength,-other-attributes.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Columbia Engineering researchers are first to reproducibly achieve the current blockade effect using atomically precise molecules at room temperature, a result that could lead to shrinking electrical components and boosting data storage and computing power. A major goal in the field of molecular electronics, which aims to use single molecules as electronic components, is to make a device where a quantized, controllable flow of charge can be achieved at room temperature. A first step in this field is for researchers to demonstrate that single molecules can function as reproducible circuit elements such as transistors or diodes that can easily operate at room temperature. A team led by Latha Venkataraman, professor of applied physics and chemistry at Columbia Engineeringand Xavier Roy, assistant professor of chemistry (Arts &amp; Sciences), published a study (DOI 10.1038/nnano.2017.156) today in Nature Nanotechnology that is the first to reproducibly demonstrate current blockade—the ability to switch a device from the insulating to the conducting state where charge is added and removed one electron at a time—using atomically precise molecular clusters at room temperature. Bonnie Choi, a graduate student in the Roy group and co-lead author of the work, created a single cluster of geometrically ordered atoms with an inorganic core made of just 14 atoms—resulting in a diameter of about 0.5 nanometers—and positioned linkers that wired the core to two gold electrodes, much as a resistor is soldered to two metal electrodes to form a macroscopic electrical circuit (e.g. the filament in a light bulb). The researchers used a scanning tunneling microscope technique that they have pioneered to make junctions comprising a single cluster connected to the two gold electrodes, which enabled them to characterize its electrical response as they varied the applied bias voltage. The technique allows them to fabricate and measure thousands of junctions with reproducible transport characteristics."</em> <a href="http://engineering.columbia.edu/news/latha-venkataraman-single-molecule-transistor">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Sophisticated network analysis means finding relationships that often aren’t easy to see. A network may have many layers — corresponding to different types of relationships in a social network, for example — but traditional approaches to analysis are limited. They tend to flatten networks into single layers, or treat layers independently of the others. A new algorithm from an interdisciplinary team at SFI identifies relationships not only within individual layers, but also across multiple layers. It’s the product of a recent project involving an anthropologist, a mathematician, a physicist, and a computer scientist. SFI Omidyar Fellow Eleanor Power, the anthropologist, says the model is broadly applicable to a variety of network types. “It can also predict missing information,” says SFI Postdoctoral Fellow Caterina De Bacco, the physicist of the group. Power and De Bacco collaborated with SFI Omidyar Fellow Daniel B. Larremore, a mathematician, and SFI Professor Cristopher Moore, a computer scientist and polymath. The group published their work April 24 in the journal Physical Review E. They tested the model on two datasets. The first came from Power, who spent two years collecting data on social networks in two villages in rural India. In her work, layers correspond to relationships like friends, babysitters, or people who would loan money to each other.

Academics at Birmingham City University are creating a new system capable of analysing trends in the playing style of musicians, which could be used to show how they would have played any piece of music – including those written decades after their deaths. Islah Ali-MacLachlan, Senior Lecturer in Sound Engineering at Birmingham City University, is leading the research which aimed to create a computer algorithm capable of replicating subtle differences in the way musicians play their instruments. The research is starting out by analysing stylistic differences between traditional Irish flute players to see how finger movements, breathing patterns and strength of breaths influence their style. Using hundreds of pieces of music produced over five decades each individual sound and movement is analysed and entered into the system to replicate over 15,000 individual notes and sounds. The system is already able to replicate notes to an 86 per cent level of accuracy and imitate nearly 75 per cent of all individual note deviations, directly linked to a musician’s specific style of play. It could be used to demonstrate how classical musicians like Mozart and Beethoven may have played contemporary pieces of music and could even highlight how individual musicians may have played the same piece of music differently in different periods as their styles changed over time.

<p><em>"The Ohio Supercomputer Center played a critical role in helping researchers reach a milestone mapping the growth of the universe from its infancy to present day. The new results released Aug. 3 confirm the surprisingly simple but puzzling theory that the present universe is composed of only 4 percent ordinary matter, 26 percent mysterious dark matter, and the remaining 70 percent in the form of mysterious dark energy, which causes the accelerating expansion of the universe. The findings from researchers at The Ohio State University and their colleagues from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) collaboration are based on data collected during the first year of the DES, which covers more than 1,300 square degrees of the sky or about the area of 6,000 full moons. DES uses the Dark Energy Camera mounted on the Blanco 4m telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory high in the Chilean Andes. According to Klaus Honscheid, Ph.D., professor of physics and leader of the Ohio State DES group, OSC was critical to getting the research done in a timely manner. His computational specialists – Michael Troxel and Niall MacCrann, postdoctoral fellows – used an estimated 300,000 core hours on OSC’s Ruby Cluster through a condo arrangement between OSC and Ohio State’s Center of Cosmology and Astro-Particle Physics (CCAPP). The team took advantage of OSC’s Anaconda environment for standard work, Anaconda, an open-source package of the Python and R programming languages for large-scale data processing, predictive analytics and scientific computing. The group then used its own software to evaluate the multi-dimensional parameter space using Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques, which is used to generate fair samples from a probability. The team also ran validation code, or null tests, for object selection and fitting code to extract information about objects in the images obtained by simultaneously fitting the same object in all available exposures of the particular object. The bulk of the team’s 4 million computational allocations are at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), a federal supercomputing facility in California. However, due to a backlog at NERSC, OSC’s role became key. According to Honscheid, for the next analysis round the team is considering increasing the amount of work done through OSC. The total survey will last five years, he said, meaning the need for high performance computing will only increase. In order to collect the data, the team built an incredibly powerful camera for the Blanco 4m telescope.

<p><em>"Whenever you move your hand or finger or eyeball, the brain sends a signal to the relevant muscles containing the information that makes this movement possible. This information is encoded in a special way that allows it to be transmitted through neurons and then actioned correctly by the relevant muscles. Exactly how this code works is something of a mystery. Neuroscientists have long been able to record these signals as they travel through neurons. But understanding them is much harder. Various algorithms exist that can decode some of these signals, but their performance is patchy. So a better way of decoding neural signals is desperately needed. Today, Joshua Glaser at Northwestern University in Chicago and a few pals say they have developed just such a technique using the new-fangled technology of machine learning. They say their decoder significantly outperforms existing approaches. Indeed, it is so much better that the team says it should become the standard method for analyzing neural signals in future."</em> <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608604/how-machine-learning-is-helping-neuroscientists-crack-our-neural-code/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"CSAIL’s machine-learning system enables smoother streaming that can better adapt to different network conditions. We’ve all experienced two hugely frustrating things on YouTube: our video either suddenly gets pixelated, or it stops entirely to rebuffer. Both happen because of special algorithms that break videos into small chunks that load as you go. If your internet is slow, YouTube might make the next few seconds of video lower resolution to make sure you can still watch uninterrupted — hence, the pixelation. If you try to skip ahead to a part of the video that hasn’t loaded yet, your video has to stall in order to buffer that part. YouTube uses these adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithms to try to give users a more consistent viewing experience. They also save bandwidth: People usually don’t watch videos all the way through, and so, with literally 1 billion hours of video streamed every day, it would be a big waste of resources to buffer thousands of long videos for all users at all times. While ABR algorithms have generally gotten the job done, viewer expectations for streaming video keep inflating, and often aren’t met when sites like Netflix and YouTube have to make imperfect trade-offs between things like the quality of the video versus how often it has to rebuffer. “Studies show that users abandon video sessions if the quality is too low, leading to major losses in ad revenue for content providers,” says MIT Professor Mohammad Alizadeh. “Sites constantly have to be looking for new ways to innovate.” Along those lines, Alizadeh and his team at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) have developed “Pensieve,” an artificial intelligence (AI) system that uses machine learning to pick different algorithms depending on network conditions. In doing so, it has been shown to deliver a higher-quality streaming experience with less rebuffering than existing systems."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/high-quality-online-video-with-less-rebuffering-pensieve-0814">[...]</a>

<p><em>"It’s long been thought that two’s company and three’s a crowd. But electrical and systems engineers at Washington University in St. Louis and their collaborators have shown that the addition of a third nanoscatterer, complementing two “tuning” nanoscatterers, to a photonics resonator makes for a fascinating physics party. Specifically, the two tuning nanoscatterers set the resonator at an "exceptional point," a special state of a system at which unusual phenomena may occur. The third nanoscatterer perturbs the system, and like a nasty playground bully, the smaller it is, the more response it gets. The Washington University team, led by Lan Yang, the Edwin H. &amp; Florence G. Skinner Professor of Electrical &amp; Systems Engineering, has made major strides recently in the study and manipulation of light. The team's most recent discovery of the sensing capability of microresonators could have impacts in the creation of biomedical devices, electronics and biohazard detection devices. "It's challenging to detect nanoscale objects, such as nanoparticles," Yang said. "If the object is very small, it introduces little perturbation to a sensing system. We utilize an unusual topological feature associated with exceptional points of a physical system to enhance the response of an optical sensor to very small perturbations, such as those introduced by nanoscale objects. The beauty of the exceptional point sensor is the smaller the perturbation, the larger the enhancement compared to a conventional sensor.""</em> <a href="https://engineering.wustl.edu/news/Pages/Study-in-Nature-Engineers-find-better-way-to-detect-nanoparticles.aspx">[...]</a>

<p><em>"While solar cells generate just 1 percent of the world’s electricity today, the International Energy Agency estimates that photovoltaic use will grow by 33 percent annually and, by 2050, solar energy could meet 16 percent of global electricity demand. An international summer program at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) shed light on two major challenges that could impede that goal—implementing renewable energy solutions on the world stage and improving solar cell efficiency. The Green Energy Materials Summer Research Program brought together 15 undergraduates -- five each from Harvard, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) in Korea, and Jiao Tong University in China -- for a thorough study of solar energy, including a hands-on component in which student teams designed, fabricated, and tested photovoltaic cells. Faculty from SEAS and both Asian institutions led discussions on light and photon physics, the history of solar cells, and the chemical reactions that enable devices to function efficiently. Student teams then worked together at the Center for Nanoscale Systems (CNS), using intricate nanofabrication techniques to engineer photovoltaic cells. “It was fascinating to learn how tiny particles and microscopic bits can make a huge difference in the efficiency of solar cells,” said Sophie Pesek, A.B. ’20, an intended environmental science and engineering concentrator. “When coating solar cells, for instance, a completely clean surface is required before bonding. So that means suiting up before you go into the labs and being careful not to drop or touch any of the cells you are working on.” Working at CNS was a lesson in patience for Pesek, who enjoyed the opportunity to see what research in a lab is really like."</em> <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2017/08/illuminating-solar-energy">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.anl.gov/articles/new-battery-material-goes-flow">New battery material goes with the flow</a></h2>

<p><em>"A new material shows promise for batteries that store electricity for the grid. The material, created by scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory, consists of carefully structured molecules designed to be particularly electrochemically stable in order to prevent the battery from losing energy to unwanted reactions. The results of the experiment, some of the best ever recorded for batteries of this type, are published today in Advanced Energy Materials. In this type of battery, called nonaqueous redox flow, energy is stored in negatively and positively charged solutions inside large tanks. The molecular makeup of the energized solutions in the tanks plays a major role in how much energy the battery is able to produce, and this research focused on designing the ideal molecule to dissolve in the positively charged tank. To maximize efficiency, the researchers had to structure the molecule to hold as much energy as possible while also being stable enough to limit superfluous reactions. “We want the stability of the molecules to be high so the battery doesn’t break down prematurely, but we also want it to be able to hold a lot of energy. The two are at odds,” said Jingjing Zhang, a postdoc involved in the research. The molecule’s reversibility, or its ability to be repeatedly charged and discharged, is the very property that allows flow batteries to function. During charging, molecules stored in the positively charged tank shed electrons through a process called oxidation. A problem arises when these now unstable, positively charged molecules begin to react with their surroundings, sapping the charge that would otherwise be stored in the tank and used for power. “When it loses an electron, the molecule has a natural tendency to find another electron for a complete pair, and if they form a bond, that means it can’t produce electricity anymore,” said Lu Zhang, the leading scientist on the team. The researchers on this project were able to shut down a common energy-sucking side reaction using a process called bicyclic substitution, which protects the most reactive parts of the molecule’s atomic scaffolding, somewhat like using insulation to cover exposed wires."</em> <a href="https://www.anl.gov/articles/new-battery-material-goes-flow">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2017/08/harvard-researchers-develop-tough-self-healing-rubber">Harvard researchers develop tough, self-healing rubber</a></h2>

<p><em>"Imagine a tire that could heal after being punctured or a rubber band that never snapped. Researchers from the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) have developed a new type of rubber that is as tough as natural rubber but can also self-heal. The research is published in Advanced Materials. Self-healing materials aren’t new — researchers at SEAS have developed self-healing hydrogels, which rely on water to incorporate reversible bonds that can promote healing. However, engineering self-healing properties in dry materials — such as rubber — has proven more challenging. That is because rubber is made of polymers often connected by permanent, covalent bonds. While these bonds are incredibly strong, they will never reconnect once broken. In order to make a rubber self-healable, the team needed to make the bonds connecting the polymers reversible, so that the bonds could break and reform. “Previous research used reversible hydrogen bonds to connect polymers to form a rubber but reversible bonds are intrinsically weaker than covalent bonds,” said Li-Heng Cai, a postdoctoral fellow at SEAS and corresponding author of the paper.  “This raised the question, can we make something tough but can still self-heal?” Cai, along with Jinrong Wu, a visiting professor from Sichuan University, China, and senior author David A. Weitz, Mallinckrodt Professor of Physics and Applied Physics, developed a hybrid rubber with both covalent and reversible bonds. The concept of mixing both covalent and reversible bonds to make a tough, self-healing rubber was proposed in theory by Cai but never shown experimentally because covalent and reversible bonds don’t like to mix. “These two types of bonds are intrinsically immiscible, like oil and water,” said Cai. So, the researchers developed a molecular rope to tie these two types of bonds together. This rope, called randomly branched polymers, allows two previously unmixable bonds to be mixed homogeneously on a molecular scale. In doing so, they were able to create a transparent, tough, self-healing rubber. Typical rubber tends to crack at certain stress point when force is applied. When stretched, hybrid rubber develops so-called crazes throughout the material, a feature similar to cracks but connected by fibrous strands. These crazes redistribute the stress, so there is no localized point of stress that can cause catastrophic failure. When the stress is released, the material snaps back to its original form and the crazes heal. Harvard’s Office of Technology Development has filed a patent application for the technology and is actively seeking commercialization opportunities."</em> <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2017/08/harvard-researchers-develop-tough-self-healing-rubber">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.mpsd.mpg.de/429875/2017-08-the_other_high_temp_superconductor">Scientists shine new light on the “other high temperature superconductor”</a></h2>

<p><em>"A study led by scientists of the Max Planck Institute for the Structure and Dynamics of Matter (MPSD) at the Center for Free-Electron Laser Science in Hamburg presents evidence of the coexistence of superconductivity and “charge-density-waves” in compounds of the poorly-studied family of bismuthates. This observation opens up new perspectives for a deeper understanding of the phenomenon of high-temperature superconductivity, a topic which is at the core of condensed matter research since more than 30 years. The paper by Nicoletti et al has been published in the PNAS. Since the beginning of the 20th century, superconductivity had been observed in some metals at temperatures only a few degrees above the absolute zero (minus 273 degrees Celsius). Only in the 1980s, physicists managed to synthetize new classes of compounds, based on ceramic materials, which were able to conduct electricity without any losses at temperatures as high as 138 K (minus 135 degrees Celsius). These were named “high temperature superconductors”. The best known and heavily studied family of high temperature superconductor is that of cuprates, which display by far the highest critical temperatures (i.e. the temperature below which superconductivity occurs), and are therefore the most promising for applications. However, a wide variety of other compounds exists, which also manifest superconductivity at fairly high temperatures, among them the recently discovered iron pnictides. A universal picture able to describe the physics behind the phenomenon of high temperature superconductivity is still missing. However, an important commonality between almost all high temperature superconductors is the emergence of superconductivity in proximity of other exotic phases of matter, such as the “charge-density-waves”. All these materials can be typically tuned from one phase to another, possibly achieving superconductivity, by chemical doping, external pressure, or magnetic fields. However, the subtle inter-relation of these phases remains poorly understood, and in some case, there are evidences that charge-density-waves and superconductivity can even coexist microscopically in the very same compound. In such circumstances, experiments performed by stimulating materials with ultrashort, intense laser pulses (as short as few hundreds of femtoseconds) have been shown in the past to provide new insights in the physics of these systems. For example, the group of Andrea Cavalleri at the MPSD in Hamburg has already successfully demonstrated that, in some cuprates compounds, such pulses can be used to remove charge-density-waves and promote superconductivity at higher temperatures, possibly even up to room temperature (see on the right: W. Hu, Nature Materials, 13, 705–711 and R. Mankowsky, Nature 516 , 71–73). In the present work, Nicoletti, Cavalleri and coworkers focused on different compounds, belonging to the poorly studied family of bismuthates. These superconductors were discovered in the 1970s, even before the cuprates, but they attracted less attention due to their far lower critical temperatures (about 30 K). They share many commonalities, but also some differences with their better-known relatives. In particular, the so-called “parent compound”, BaBiO3, has a robust charge-density-wave phase, from which superconductivity emerges by chemical substitution."</em> <a href="https://www.mpsd.mpg.de/429875/2017-08-the_other_high_temp_superconductor">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Physicists at the University of Pennsylvania have invented a new type of graphene-based sensor that could one day be used as a low-cost diagnostic system able to test for biomarker molecules, which are indicative of disease states. In collaboration with Penn chemists, the researchers published a paper in Chemical Science in which they use this sensor, for the first time, to directly answer a basic scientific question in nanotechnology about whether a particular protein maintains its structure when it assembles around an inorganic nanoparticle. The finding may have medical applications down the line. The research was led by Jinglei Ping, a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Physics &amp; Astronomy in Penn’s School of Arts &amp; Sciences, physics professor A.T. Charlie Johnson and Katherine Pulsipher, previously a grad student in the Department of Chemistry and now a postdoc in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering in the School of Engineering and Applied Science. Chemistry professors Ivan Dmochowski and Jeffery Saven, graduate students Ramya Vishnubhotla and Jose Villegas and alumnae Tacey Hicks and Stephanie Honig also contributed to the study. This unique sensor, which the researchers call a graphene micro electrode, works by measuring the current that flows from a liquid sample to the graphene surface. The researchers found that this technique is especially useful in more complicated liquid samples, such as biological fluids, which typically have a lot of salt and proteins. Dmochowski’s group has been studying the interaction of inorganic nanoparticles with proteins for the past decade. Specifically, the researchers have been looking at a type of protein called ferritin, which is better known for being an iron-storage protein. A particular thermophilic ferritin has the unusual feature of assembling in high salt and disassembling in low salt. “What we found some years ago,” Dmochowski said, “is that we could take salt out of the equation and work in low salt where the protein would normally be disassembled and put in a gold nanoparticle with a coating that makes it very charged in solution with the ferritin. The nanoparticle is spontaneously encapsulated by the protein, like a ship in a bottle. The protein cloaks the nanoparticle and changes its properties in solution.” Inorganic nanoparticles are widely considered potential next-generation diagnostic and therapeutic agents. However, they are known to interact with and denature proteins, which form a thin shell around the nanoparticle called a corona. “That's not what happens with our protein,” Dmochowski said. “It has 24 different subunits that come together to encapsulate the nanoparticle, and we have found over the years that it maintains much of its native structure.” But the researchers had an unresolved question. One characteristic feature of this protein is that is has four triangular nano-sized pores. The researchers wanted to know whether these pores are maintained when the protein assembles around the gold nanoparticle. Although there are several techniques that might be able to resolve this challenging imaging question, Johnson said, they tend to be a bit more indirect and cumbersome."</em> <a href="https://news.upenn.edu/news/penn-collaboration-uses-new-type-graphene-sensor-answer-fundamental-nanotechnology-question">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Battery researchers agree that one of the most promising possibilities for future battery technology is the lithium-air (or lithium-oxygen) battery, which could provide three times as much power for a given weight as today’s leading technology, lithium-ion batteries. But tests of various approaches to creating such batteries have produced conflicting and confusing results, as well as controversies over how to explain them. Now, a team at MIT has carried out detailed tests that seem to resolve the questions surrounding one promising material for such batteries: a compound called lithium iodide (LiI). The compound was seen as a possible solution to some of the lithium-air battery’s problems, including an inability to sustain many charging-discharging cycles, but conflicting findings had raised questions about the material’s usefulness for this task. The new study explains these discrepancies, and although it suggests that the material might not be suitable after all, the work provides guidance for efforts to overcome LiI’s drawbacks or find alternative materials. The new results appear in the journal Energy and Environmental Science, in a paper by Yang Shao-Horn, MIT’s W.M. Keck Professor of Energy; Paula Hammond, the David H. Koch Professor in Engineering and head of the Department of Chemical Engineering; Michal Tulodziecki, a recent MIT postdoc at the Research Laboraotory of Electronics; Graham Leverick, an MIT graduate student; Yu Katayama, a visiting student; and three others. The promise of the lithium-air battery comes from the fact one of the two electrodes, which are usually made of metal or metal oxides, is replaced with air that flows in and out of the battery; a weightless substance is thus substituted for one of the heavy components. The other electrode in such batteries would be pure metallic lithium, a lightweight element. But that theoretical promise has been limited in practice because of three issues: the need for high voltages for charging, a low efficiency with regard to getting back the amount of energy put in, and low cycle lifetimes, which result from instability in the battery’s oxygen electrode. Researchers have proposed adding lithium iodide in the electrolyte as a way of addressing these problems. But published results have been contradictory, with some studies finding the LiI does improve the cycling life, “while others show that the presence of LiI leads to irreversible reactions and poor battery cycling,” Shao-Horn says. Previously, “most of the research was focused on organics” to make lithium-air batteries feasible, says Michal Tulodziecki, the paper’s lead author. But most of these organic compounds are not stable, he says, “and that’s why there’s been a great focus on lithium iodide [an inorganic material], which some papers said helps the batteries achieve thousands of cycles. But others say no, it will damage the battery.” In this new study, he says, “we explored in detail how lithium iodide affects the process, with and without water,” a comparison which turned out to be significant. The team looked at the role of LiI on lithium-air battery discharge, using a different approach from most other studies. One set of studies was conducted with the components outside of the battery, which allowed the researchers to zero in on one part of the reaction, while the other study was done in the battery, to help explain the overall process."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/researchers-clarify-mystery-about-proposed-battery-material-0815">[...]</a>

The new liquid-free composite is made from a slurry of a material called graphene, zinc oxide, and the polymer polyvinylidene difluoride. Graphene is an extremely thin layer of carbon that has many potential technological applications, including lubrication. “It has superior thermal conductivity, high strength and provides ultralow friction,” said Vilas Pol, an associate professor of chemical engineering at Purdue University.

<p><em>"University of Sydney researchers have found a solution for one of the biggest stumbling blocks preventing zinc-air batteries from overtaking conventional lithium-ion batteries as the power source of choice in electronic devices. Zinc-air batteries are batteries powered by zinc metal and oxygen from the air. Due to the global abundance of zinc metal, these batteries are much cheaper to produce than lithium-ion batteries, and they can also store more energy (theoretically five times more than that of lithium-ion batteries), are much safer, and are more environmentally friendly. While zinc-air batteries are currently used as an energy source in hearing aids and some film cameras and railway signal devices, their widespread use has been hindered by the fact that, up until now, recharging them has proved difficult. This is due to the lack of electrocatalysts that successfully reduce and generate oxygen during the discharging and charging of a battery. Published in Advanced Materials today, a paper authored by chemical engineering researchers from the University of Sydney and Nanyang Technological University outlines a new three-stage method to overcome this problem. According to lead author Professor Yuan Chen, from the University of Sydney’s Faculty of Engineering and Information Technologies, the new method can be used to create bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts for building rechargeable zinc-air batteries from scratch. “Up until now, rechargeable zinc-air batteries have been made with expensive precious metal catalysts, such as platinum and iridium oxide. In contrast, our method produces a family of new high-performance and low-cost catalysts,” he said. These new catalysts are produced through the simultaneous control of the: 1) composition, 2) size and 3) crystallinity of metal oxides of earth-abundant elements such as iron, cobalt and nickel. They can then be applied to build rechargeable zinc-air batteries. Paper co-author Dr Li Wei, also from the University’s Faculty of Engineering and Information Technologies, said trials of zinc-air batteries developed with the new catalysts had demonstrated excellent rechargeability – including less than a 10 percent battery efficacy drop over 60 discharging/charging cycles of 120 hours. “We are solving fundamental technological challenges to realise more sustainable metal-air batteries for our society,” Professor Chen added."</em> <a href="http://sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2017/08/15/university-of-sydney-charges-ahead-on-zinc-air-batteries.html">[...]</a>

Current levitators are constructed using Langevin horns that need to be manufactured to high tolerance with carefully matched resonant frequencies. This resonance condition is hard to maintain as their temperature changes due to transduction heating. In addition, Langevin horns are required to operate at high voltages (>100 V) which may cause problems in challenging experimental environments. Here, we design, build, and evaluate a single-axis levitator based on multiple, low-voltage (ca. 20 V), well-matched, and commercially available ultrasonic transducers. The levitator operates at 40 kHz in air and can trap objects above 2.2 g/cm3 density and 4 mm in diameter whilst consuming 10 W of input power. Levitation of water, fused-silica spheres, small insects, and electronic components is demonstrated. The device is constructed from low-cost off-the-shelf components and is easily assembled using 3D printed sections. Complete instructions and a part list are provided on how to assemble the levitator."</em> <a href="http://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.4989995">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://engineering.columbia.edu/news/michael-burke-termolecular-reactions">Researchers Discover New Class of Chemical Reaction</a></h2>

<p><em>"Finding opens door to innumerable possibilities, from the design of new types of engines to understanding the planetary chemistry responsible for cloud formations, climate change, and the conditions for creating life. A new study led by Michael P. Burke, assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Columbia Engineering, has identified the significance of a new class of chemical reactions involving three molecules that each participate in the breaking and forming of chemical bonds. The reaction of three different molecules is enabled by an “ephemeral collision complex,” formed from the collision of two molecules, which lives long enough to collide with a third molecule. This fourth class, which the researchers have named “chemically termolecular reactions,” was first hypothesized by Cyril Hinshelwood and Nikolay Semenov in their studies of chain reactions in the 1920s and 30s (they won the 1956 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work). For decades, researchers have considered these reactions unimportant—if they even occurred at all—and until now, no one has studied them. Burke, who explores a variety of problems at the interface between fundamental physical chemistry and practical engineering devices, decided to investigate these reactions after realizing that common combustion situations, such as those encountered in many engines, have sufficiently high fractions of highly reactive molecules known as free radicals to make these reactions possible. The new study is published today in Nature Chemistry. “Combustion has always been a launching point for understanding all sorts of other chemical mechanisms,” says Burke, who is also a member of the Data Science Institute. “Potentially there could be innumerable reactions from this new class that impact how we model gas phase chemistry, from designing new types of engines to understanding the planetary chemistry responsible for cloud formations, climate change, evolution of pollutants, even perhaps the sequence of reactions that could impact the conditions for extraterrestrial life. Our discovery opens up a whole new world of possibilities.” For example, space vehicles experience very high temperatures and radical fractions in their descent back to Earth. Burke speculates that this fourth class of reactions could impact the heat flux to the vehicle, with significant implications for the design of thermal protection systems to keep astronauts and/or payloads safe when coming down to Earth. Working with Stephen J. Klippenstein, (Chemical Sciences and Engineering Division, Argonne National Laboratory), Burke used state-of-the-art computational methods, combining quantum chemical computations that simulate the breaking and forming of chemical bonds among reacting molecules with kinetic-transport computations that simulate the reactions and movements of bulk gases that governs performance of engineering devices."</em> <a href="http://engineering.columbia.edu/news/michael-burke-termolecular-reactions">[...]</a>

<p><em>"For most of us, fluid dynamics and mechanics aren’t particularly significant — that is, until we’re white-knuckling it on a bumpy plane ride or trying to stay buoyant in unusually bubbly water. The way we navigate through air and water may one day be improved thanks to UC Santa Barbara researchers studying the complex properties and interactions of fluids. Fueled by multiple Multi-University Research Initiative (MURI) grants from the U.S. Department of Defense’s Office of Naval Research, the UCSB scientists may also gain insight into some of classical physics’ greatest mysteries. What happens when a bubble is generated under water? Or when it pops? For many of us this matter, called cavitation, is fairly esoteric, the stuff of musings when we take a frothy bath or blow soap bubbles for entertainment. But if you’re piloting a ship across the ocean, bubbles can take on new meaning. Far from being the insubstantial pockets of air that we think of when waves crash and create foam, they actually do harm to the vessel, have adverse effects on propulsion efficiency and drastically increase ship vulnerability. “Bubbles are responsible for quite a loss in propulsion efficiency,” said UCSB mechanical engineering professor Frederic Gibou. “And when you consider that about 90 percent of the world’s goods are transported by sea, any progress on ships’ efficiency will translate into significant reduction of our energy consumption.” Additionally, due to the enormous difference of pressure created when bubble jets flow through propeller blades, they actually damage the propeller and other parts of the ship. “Cavitation is used in medical science to break down kidney stones,” Gibou said. “This destructive power is thus great in this context, but not in the context of the Navy!”"</em> <a href="http://www.news.ucsb.edu/2017/018190/next-generation-transport">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://cordis.europa.eu/news/rcn/128539_en.html">Magnetic properties of new nanoporous material for data storage, attracts attention</a></h2>

<p><em>"With around 90% of the worlds data generated in the last two years alone, there is a pressing need for more efficient data storage and transfer. The EU-funded SPIN-PORICS nanocomposite prototype may have a solution. Electronic devices which store information through magnetisation rely on magnetic switching, typically enabled by localised magnetic ﬁelds (generated via electromagnetic induction) or by spin-polarised electric currents (spin-transfer torque). However, both systems require relatively high electric currents which heat up materials, resulting in significant energy loss through heat dissipation - the so-called Joule effect. Energy efficiency could be increased if the necessary magnetic fields and electric currents could be reduced. This is achievable by lowering the coersivity (the ability to withstand an external magnetic field without becoming demagnetised) of the actuated material. Recent advances in this area have only reported significant success below 300 Kelvin and only with ultra-thin films or nanoparticles. However, the EU-funded SPIN-PORICS project recently announced the successful creation of a new material with sponge-like properties, with promise to advances efforts. The SPIN-PORICS (Merging Nanoporous Materials with Energy-Efficient Spintronics) project team reported in the journal Advanced Functional Materials that they had created the first prototypes of nanoporous magnetic memories, based on copper and nickel alloys (CuNi). The interior of these CuNi films were organised like a sponge, with only 5 or 10 nanometres spaces between pores, limiting space in the pore walls to a few dozen atoms. This nanoporous layer was filled with a dielectric material, where the magnetic properties were tuned at room temperature (RT) by using liquid electrolytes to apply voltage. The project team reported being able to achieve a 35% reduction of magnetic coercivity, meeting the energy consumption required to reorientate the magnetic domains which is necessary for data recording. This result is due to the nanoporous design which enables the whole film - not only the surface - to participate in the electromagnetic effect. Summarising the success of the prototype project coordinator Professor Jordi Sort has said, ‘The nanopores found on the inside of nanoporous materials offer a great amount of surface. With this vast surface concentrated in a very small space we can apply the voltage of a battery and enormously reduce the energy needed to orientate the magnetic domains and record data. This represents a new paradigm in the energy saving of computers and in computing and handling magnetic data in general'"</em> <a href="http://cordis.europa.eu/news/rcn/128539_en.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Designed to be an easy to use device, it's a possible solution for parents with children spending too much time watching TV. A concern that parents have every day is to limit the time their children spend watching television. We all know the damage that excessive exposure to a TV screen can make! One can impose a rule like "a maximum of two TV hours per day", even distributed over the course of the day. The easy part is setting the rules. The problems come when children have to comply them! And how do you take into account the time elapsed, so that kids do not exceed the time limit agreed? Relying on technology could be one way to cut down (not to cut out, this is impossible ...) the daily discussions. Technology could also count the minutes for us. A TV Smart Timer, like the one in this post, could be the possible solution to this problem. The TV Smart Timer, which we can shorten to TST, is designed to be easy to use, for both children and parents. Everyday there is a certain amount of time available for the child to watch TV. It is set up by his/her dad or mom and he/she can handle it as he/she likes during the day. The time available, shown on the display, can be controlled by the big red button in the picture. When the child wants to watch TV (of course after the homework is done!) he/she presses the red button, which turns on the TV and starts the timer. When there is less than one hour left, the device's display starts to blink slowly. This way the child is aware of the remaining time. Whenever he or she wants to stop enjoing TV, all that they have to do is press the red button again. After that the timer stops (the word "Paused" appears on display) and the TV turns off. This way, kids learn to manage their "TV time" and parents are certain that the time set up won't be exceeded. TST has an internal clock that resets the available time to the initial duration. This happens at the end of every day. The parent accesses the timer settings via a special "key": you can see it at the bottom of the picture. The key is made in a very simple way: I used an RJ45 plug (those for network cables) with a resistor on two of the eight contacts. Easy to make or to rebuild if you lose it. By plugging in the key into its socket, a special menu is enabled, from which you can adjust the internal clock, set the maximum time or reset the timer manually. With key inserted, the timer is disabled and the TV is always turned on, so that the older ones can watch TV without ... time limits. Of course when the key is inserted the timer is disabled and stopped. The TST is built around Arduino, using an Arduino Uno, a 2-line 16-character LCD display and an RTC watch."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/manicminer/an-arduino-based-tv-smart-timer-8c1f56">[...]</a>

I created this project because one day I came home to my dog barking and thought how long had he been barking. I could hear him down the hall when I walked into the building. I live in condos btw so I don't need him barking all day long and making my neighbors upset. Or more to the point why is he barking??? So I thought, "Hey, I got these mic boards laying around from a sensor kit; lets see if I can catch if he is doing it a lot! Oh and I got this PIR motion detector, lets slap that on also!" When i created the first iteration it only had one mic board for sound detection but I was having problems with it either being way too sensitive or not sensitive enough. I couldn't find the 'sweet spot'. So my solution was to not only add another mic, but to add adjustable thresholds for when they consider the reading to in fact be barking. I have one mic board turn pretty sensitive but with a higher threshold and the other with low gain and a lower threshold. It works pretty good together. Also on the first iteration I had a lot of problems with the mics picking up the radio rx/tx because it was so close to the esp8266 module. It also created voltage fluctuations slightly which wasn't helping. I added 2 capacitors &amp; lowered the esp8266 tx power and it almost got rid of it all. Just recently when I was testing a couple new ESP8266-01S chips, i noticed that the "S" chips completely eliminated the noise from the tx signal &amp; voltage fluctuations."</em> <a href="https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/vapor83/barkbox-simple-noise-intrusion-detection-device-652d27">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://blog.heypete.com/2017/07/29/a-look-inside-the-ds3231-real-time-clock/">A look inside the DS3231 real-time clock</a></h2>

<p><em>"Dallas Semiconductor, now owned by Maxim Integrated, is well known for making some excellent real-time clocks (RTCs). Take, for example, the DS1307: it’s simple, works with essentially any cheap 32,768 Hz watch crystal, is easily accessible over I2C, and is extremely power efficient (500nA current when running the oscillator on battery power). As great as it is, the DS1307 has a major drawback: it relies on an external crystal and lacks any sort of temperature compensation. Thus, any change in temperature will cause the clock to drift. A 20ppm error in the frequency of the crystal adds up to about a minute of error per month. Not so great. Fortunately, Maxim also offers the DS3231, which is advertised as an “Extremely Accurate I2C-Integrated RTC/TCXO/Crystal”. This chip has the 32kHz crystal integrated into the package itself and uses a built-in temperature sensor to periodically measure the temperature of the crystal and, by switching different internal capacitors in and out of the crystal circuit, can precisely adjust its frequency so it remains constant. It’s specified to keep time within 2ppm from 0°C to +40°C, and 3.5ppm from -40°C to +85°C, which means the clock would only drift 63 and 110 seconds per year, respectively. Very cool. The one (very minor) downside is that it draws about twice the current, a bit less than 1 μA, than the DS1307. Still, a common 220mAh CR2032 battery could power the chip for at least a decade with no problem. Such a circuit would be mostly limited by the CR2032’s self-discharge rate anyway. In my case, I wanted to use such RTCs on several of my Raspberry Pis that are not regularly (read: almost never) connected to the internet, and so cannot always get their time from NTP servers. Some clever person designed a very simple board that fits on the Raspberry Pi’s pin headers for power, ground, and I2C and has the DS3231 chip, pull-up resistors for the I2C bus, and a decoupling capacitor. It even has pads for a backup battery (not included, but adding a battery holder and coin cell is straightforward). Chinese vendors on eBay sell the board for about $1.50, with free shipping. Perfect. Here’s the board I’m using on one of my Pis, along with the backup battery and holder I added."</em> <a href="https://blog.heypete.com/2017/07/29/a-look-inside-the-ds3231-real-time-clock/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.pmonta.com/555-contest/logic/logic.html">Digital logic using 555 chips</a></h2>

<p><em>"Question: is the 555 complete in the Boolean sense? That is, can any Boolean function be realized as a network of 555 chips? Answer: yes. Tie the threshold pin high---this essentially disables the 555's internal latch. Now provide inputs to the reset and trigger pins and take the output from either the totem-pole output or the open-collector output with a suitable external load. This is a somewhat unusual gate---it can be interpreted as the negation of the conditional operator, or as an AND gate with one of the inputs inverted. But it is complete: an inverter can be obtained by tying reset high; now using this inverter, invert the reset input and one has a NOR gate made from two 555s; the NOR gate is known to be complete. Of course a given Boolean function will be implemented most efficiently by telling the logic synthesis tool (or human designer) to map directly onto the "555 gate" rather than use the NOR-gate construction; but the NOR is a convenient route to the completeness proof. Storage elements can be made from cross-coupled gates or, as we will see below, from 555s configured to use their internal latch, which is slightly more efficient."</em> <a href="http://www.pmonta.com/555-contest/logic/logic.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This is a solder fume extractor with a couple of twists. Besides an internal rechargeable Lithium Polymer (Li-Poly) battery for portability, this extractor incorporates a low-power motion detector and a USB A accessory connector. When you reach for your soldering iron, the motion detector turns on the extractor's fan for a predefined period then turns it off to preserve battery power. An LED reading lamp can be connected to the accessory port to eliminate shadows in the work area. This one is also ambidextrous; flip it end-for-end to point the motion detector at the soldering iron holder to the right or to the left of your work area. The fume extractor was built into an off-the-shelf ABS plastic enclosure; no 3D printed parts were used. The enclosure comes from the manufacturer without any holes so we'll be drilling some with diameters ranging from 1/8 to 1-7/8 inches. Beginning makers may have some trouble with the larger holes, so don't hesitate to ask for help from someone with fabrication experience. We'll include a printable, actual size layout and drilling guide to assist when preparing the enclosure. As with any project involving power tools, sharp implements, and hot soldering equipment, safety is your primary concern. Review tool operational safety instructions before beginning this project. Be careful! Inspiration for this project came from makers like Phillip Burgess and many others with unique solder fume extractor designs.

And that is how it works."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Toxic-Gas-Detector/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Using an ESP32 or ESP8266 we can forecast weather by reading air pressure from a sensor such as the BOSCH BMP085/180 or BME280. Then by monitoring the changes in air pressure and categorising the changes thus: Rising quickly, Rising, Rising slowly, Steady, Falling slowly, Falling, Falling quickly. And applying the changes to a set of rules this enables the weather to be forecast based on air pressure at your location (adjusted from sea level with a offset) and then by monitoring changes over time, in this case 3 and 1 hours leading to a prediction with a good level of certainty."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/ESP32ESP8266-Weather-ForecasterPredictor/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"If you have an E-Reader such as a Barnes &amp; Noble NOOK or an Amazon Kindle then you're already familiar with e-paper. The e-paper display on your e-reader is what allows you to read it in direct sunlight without any glare. However, you also know that the e-paper screen takes a really long time to update. This means that you can't use it for gaming, but it's perfect for providing you with timely weather information wherever you need it! This super-simple project creates just that with minimal assembly and coding time. Let's dive in!"</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/E-Paper-Weather-Display-With-Photon-and-IFTTT/">[...]</a>
