<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1903, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Blumlein">Alan Blumlein</a>. Este engenheiro electrotécnico inglês ficou conhecido pelas suas inúmeras invenções nos campos das telecomunicações, da gravação de som, do som estereofónico, da televisão e do radar. Blumlein patenteou o amplificador Ultra-Linear . Com um design aparentemente simples, o circuito forneceu uma ligação no enrolamento primário do transformador de saída para fornecer feedback para a segunda grelha, o que melhorou a linearidade do amplificador. Com a ligação colocada na extremidade do ânodo do enrolamento primário, o tubo (válvula) está efectivamente conectado como um triodo, e se a ligação estava na extremidade de alimentação, como um pentodo puro. Blumlein descobriu que, se a ligação fosse colocada a uma distância de 15-20% abaixo da extremidade de fornecimento do transformador de saída, o tubo ou a válvula combinariam as características positivas tanto do triodo quanto do design do pentodo.
Faz também anos hoje que nascia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Ellery_Hale">George Ellery Hale</a>. Nascido em Chicago em 1868 este astrónomo ficou conhecido pela sua descoberta de campos magnéticos em manchas solares e como elemento principal no planeamento e construção de vários telescópios de importância mundial; Nomeadamente, o telescópio de refracção de 40 polegadas no Yerkes Observatory, telescópio reflector Hale de 60 polegadas no Mount Wilson Observatory, telescópio reflector de 100 polegadas, no Mount Wilson, e o telescópio reflector Hale de 200 polegadas no Observatório Palomar.
Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1833, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Waage">Peter Waage</a>. Este químico Norueguês conjuntamente com seu cunhado Cato Maximilian Guldberg, descobriram e desenvolveram a lei de acção das massas entre 1864 e 1879.</p>

<p>Na semana que passou a Thyssenkrupp apresentou o primeiro elevador sem corda. O MULTI é uma das inovações mais avançadas do setor, desenvolvidas desde o século 19: o primeiro sistema de elevação sem corda e com movimento lateral do mundo. Em vez de uma cabine por eixo movendo-se para cima e para baixo, o MULTI oferece várias cabines operando em loop, como um sistema de metro dentro de um prédio.
A Canonical passou a suportar o Ubuntu Core a correr no Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3.
Ainda esta semana a fundação Eclipse apresentou o seu novo IDE - o Eclipse Oxygen. O Eclipse Oxygen deste ano é o 12º lançamento oficial simultâneo (SR); Inclui o trabalho árduo de 83 projectos de código aberto, que inclui aproximadamente duas milhões de novas linhas de código. O resultado deste processo é um repositório composto de software aberto e uma nova versão do Eclipse IDE. A versão Eclipse Oxygen inclui muitas melhorias na funcionalidade e desempenho, inclui novas ferramentas para análise de cobertura de código Java ™.
Faz também hoje 10 anos que chegou às lojas o primeiro iPhone. Quer se goste ou não este produto marcou uma mudança no paradigma dos smartphone e impulsionou, fazendo algumas vitimas pelo caminho, uma verdadeira revolução na forma como usamos estes equipamentos no nosso dia-a-dia.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projectos de maker assim como alguns modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis. Saiu a revista MagPI nº 59 e a revista newelectronics de 27 de Junho.</p>

<p><em>"The announcement of MULTI in 2014 was celebrated with a massively popular video. Since then, it has been the subject of widespread interest and recognition, most recently receiving Gold in the category of Transportation &amp; Logistics at the 2017 Edison Awards. Now, MULTI is ready to go live. The medieval town of Rottweil, Germany, may seem an unusual place to test such futuristic technology, but in many ways it is the obvious choice. The new elevator-testing tower there is itself on the very cutting edge of applied science. It was also specifically designed to test MULTI – and on June 22nd, that is exactly what it will do. A full day of activities awaits the guests attending the unveiling of MULTI. The agenda includes presentations on every aspect of the MULTI, from a review of its maglev system, multi-level braking and inductive power technology, to a discussion of its interior design,an inspection of the testing shafts in the new towerand an exclusive on-site conference hosted by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat. However, the main event addresses a central issue in the future of mobility. At the stroke of noon, MULTI rises – and the “rope-less revolution” begins. MULTI is the world’s first elevator system that altogether dispenses with cables or ropes. At first, that may sound like an odd thing to celebrate. But it is this ‘odd thing’ that opens up the possibility of an elevator that can go up, down, right, left – offering passengers a previously impossible opportunity to move about freely within buildings, and beyond. Make no mistake: this widely anticipated technology has the potential to revolutionize urban life, from underground subway construction to the design of buildings. And, as of June 22nd, 2017, the first fully functional unit is in use, in Rottweil, Germany."</em> <a href="http://www.urban-hub.com/ideas/the-rope-less-revolution-begins-now-first-full-scale-multi-goes-into-operation-2/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://insights.ubuntu.com/2017/06/27/canonical-supports-ubuntu-core-on-the-raspberry-pi-compute-module/">Canonical supports Ubuntu Core on the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3</a></h2>

<p><em>"Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu, today announces that its IoT OS, Ubuntu Core, is available on the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3 – the general-purpose compute product from the Raspberry Pi Foundation. The Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3 (CM3), announced in January 2017, is a micro-version of the Raspberry Pi 3 intended to provide a simple, cost optimised single board computer. As the CM3 can be easily slotted in and out of any device with a standard, low-cost DDR2 SODIMM connector it provides an easy path for device creation, upgrading, or maintenance. Should your digital signage solution, for example, require new functionality or increased power after a period of use, upgrading its compute is now as simple as inserting a new board. The Compute Module 3 also has a more resilient storage built into the board making it a more robust compute option for industrial applications. Support for Ubuntu Core on the CM3 is another significant step towards Canonical’s vision of ‘Software Defined Everything’; a world where all devices can afford general purpose compute. By installing Ubuntu Core on the CM3, device manufacturers have an easy and cost-effective route to the production of fully-featured devices and can easily upgrade functionality through the addition of snaps – the universal Linux application packaging format. In addition, device manufacturers can develop their own app stores, all while benefiting from the additional security of Ubuntu Core."</em> <a href="https://insights.ubuntu.com/2017/06/27/canonical-supports-ubuntu-core-on-the-raspberry-pi-compute-module/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://phys.org/news/2017-06-year-old-physics-problem.html">A 100-year-old physics problem has been solved</a></h2>

<p><em>"At EPFL, researchers challenge a fundamental law and discover that more electromagnetic energy can be stored in wave-guiding systems than previously thought. The discovery has implications in telecommunications. Working around the fundamental law, they conceived resonant and wave-guiding systems capable of storing energy over a prolonged period while keeping a broad bandwidth. Their trick was to create asymmetric resonant or wave-guiding systems using magnetic fields. The study, which has just been published in Science, was led by Kosmas Tsakmakidis, first at the University of Ottawa and then at EPFL's Bionanophotonic Systems Laboratory run by Hatice Altug, where the researcher is now doing post-doctoral research. This breakthrough could have a major impact on many fields in engineering and physics. The number of potential applications is close to infinite, with telecommunications, optical detection systems and broadband energy harvesting representing just a few examples."</em> <a href="https://phys.org/news/2017-06-year-old-physics-problem.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.rh.gatech.edu/news/592676/researchers-create-3-d-printed-tensegrity-objects-capable-dramatic-shape-change">Researchers Create 3-D Printed Tensegrity Objects Capable of Dramatic Shape Change</a></h2>

<p><em>"A team of researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology has developed a way to use 3-D printers to create objects capable of expanding dramatically that could someday be used in applications ranging from space missions to biomedical devices. The new objects use tensegrity, a structural system of floating rods in compression and cables in continuous tension. The researchers fabricated the struts from shape memory polymers that unfold when heated. “Tensegrity structures are extremely lightweight while also being very strong,” said Glaucio Paulino, a professor in Georgia Tech’s School of Civil and Environmental Engineering. “That’s the reason there’s a heavy amount of interest right now in researching the use of tensegrity structures for outer space exploration. The goal is to find a way to deploy a large object that initially takes up little space.” The research, which was reported June 14 in the journal Scientific Reports, was sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research. The researchers used 3-D printers to create the struts that make up one of the primary components of the tensegrity structure. To enable the struts to be temporarily folded flat, the researchers designed them to be hollow with a narrow opening that runs the length of the tube. Each strut has an attachment point on each end to connect to a network of elastic cables, which are also made with 3-D printers. Once the struts were heated to 65 degrees Celsius, the researchers could partially flatten and fold them into a shape resembling the letter W. The cooled structures then retain the temporary shape. With all cables attached, the objects can be reheated to initiate the transformation into tensegrity structures."</em> <a href="http://www.rh.gatech.edu/news/592676/researchers-create-3-d-printed-tensegrity-objects-capable-dramatic-shape-change">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Participating in the project, which is coordinated by the UC3M Robotics Lab, are researchers from Germany, Greece, Italy and the United Kingdom. Its goal is to develop an intelligent system for the autonomous excavation of small diameter, high gradient tunnels in urban environments. “The use of innovative localization, mapping and navigation techniques, along with sensors and georadars, will allow them to be adapted to different land surfaces and aid in the analysis of the work environment and decision making in attaining the goals,” stated project coordinator, Carlos Balaguer, full professor in the UC3M Department of Systems Engineering and Automation. BADGER (roBot for Autonomous unDerGround trenchless opERations, mapping and navigation) is a project that incorporates several innovations. The main one is this new application of robotics to an underground environment. Until now, robotics was a field focused especially on walking or rolling surface robots and flying or underwater robots. Autonomous navigation, meanwhile, is another of the project’s strong points, as all the sensors, georadars and computers will be integrated in the machine, which enables them to make a much more precise and controlled exploration of the land. Lastly, the use of ultrasound techniques to perforate the ground, accompanied by a 3D printer on the robot itself to reinforce the tunnel where the cables and tubes lie, also plays an essential role."</em> <a href="http://www.uc3m.es/ss/Satellite/UC3MInstitucional/en/Detalle/Comunicacion_C/1371233595098/1371215537949/Intelligent_underground_robot_for_urban_environments_is_designed">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/en/science/photonics/news/6754/">New Femto-Camera with Quadrillion Fractions of a Second Resolution</a></h2>

<p><em>"Researchers from ITMO University have built a setup for recording holograms of tiny objects like living cells with a femtosecond speed. The new method allows one to reconstruct phase topography of a studied sample according to deformations that emerge in a laser pulse when it passes through the specimen. In comparison to electron microscopes, the device can visualize transparent biological structures without introducing contrast agents. The paper was published in Applied Physics Letters. Vital activity of living cells is a complex sequence of biochemical reactions and physical processes; many of them take place with high temporal resolution. To register such rapid transformations, scientists need very accurate and much faster equipment. Biological tissue can be studied with an electron microscope, but this method requires introducing a special dye in the sample. The dye makes cells contrast, although it may affect their metabolism. Digital holographic microscopes can cope with this drawback, but have low spatial resolution. The new camera created by ITMO scientists can register fast processes in transparent specimens and allows one to increase the resolution of images in a wide range. The device records phase deformations of ultrashort, or femtosecond, laser pulses, that emerge when the light passes through the studied sample. The phase images, or holograms, will help explore cells for better understanding mechanisms of autoimmune, oncological, neurodegenerative diseases, as well as monitoring cells during surgical interventions like, for example, cancer therapy."</em> <a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/en/science/photonics/news/6754/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scientists from the Excellence Cluster Universe at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität Munich have establised "Cosmowebportal", a unique data centre for cosmological simulations located at the Leibniz Supercomputing Centre (LRZ) of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences. The complete results of a series of large hydrodynamical cosmological simulations are available, with data volumes typically exceeding several hundred terabytes. Scientists worldwide can interactively explore these complex simulations via a web interface and directly access the results. With current telescopes, scientists can observe our Universe’s galaxies and galaxy clusters and their distribution along an invisible cosmic web. From the exact measurement of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) with the Planck space observatory and many other measurements for example with the Hubble space telescope, the scientists were able to develop a precise model of our Universe. However, little is yet known about how these structures could form from the distribution of matter in the early universe. In order to answer this question, theoretical astrophysicists work with cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations. They test their hypotheses about the universe by developing mathematical models that describe the underlying complex physical processes and run them on high-performance computers trying to reproduce the evolution of the Universe over billions of years. If the underlying assumptions are correct, the simulations should match the current astronomical observations and findings. A group of astrophysicists led by Dr. Klaus Dolag from the Excellence Cluster Universe at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität Munich in close collaboration with the LRZ have now initiated "Cosmowebportal". This unique data centre for cosmological simulations provides access to the results of the world's most extensive set of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, Magneticum Pathfinder, also developed by Klaus Dolag’s team and carried out at the LRZ. The complete simulations are saved at the LRZ in Garching on a data store for large datasets, which is connected to the supercomputer SuperMUC. Using a web interface, interested scientists can, for example, select objects from the raw simulation data, process it, and even create virtual observations mimicing existing or future space telescopes."</em> <a href="http://www.universe-cluster.de/public-outreach/press-releases/mitteilung/article//A-unique-data-centre-for-cosmological-simulations/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Masdar Institute researchers have engineered a novel non-aqueous low-cost flow battery equipped with fast-charging that is able to charge itself in half the time it would normally take, which they believe may enable cheaper and more efficient large-scale renewable energy storage. The prototype battery has an open-circuit voltage of 1.2 volts, with an extra voltage of 1.8 volts leveraged for rapid charging. The device is the first such non-aqueous redox flow battery to employ the unique fast-charging design, cutting the amount of time it takes to fully charge by up to 50%. “Non-aqueous redox flow batteries have the potential to store more energy than aqueous-based systems, because organic solvents have a wider voltage window than that of water; which allows for formulation of battery chemistries with higher open-circuit voltages. But due to other challenges, their performance has not yet reached the levels achieved by their water-based counterparts,” explained Musbaudeen Bamgbopa, a PhD student at MI. He believes that a major opportunity for non-aqueous flow batteries – which are a type of flow battery that utilize solvents other than water – is for scientists to expand their focus on performance improvement beyond a narrow focus on increasing energy density. Bamgbopa and his advisor, Dr. Saif Almheiri, Assistant Professor of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, realized that there was another way to capitalize on the wide voltage window of non-aqueous flow batteries. “What we did in our work is present another advantage of the non-aqueous based redox flow system that scientists have overlooked. Instead of trying to increase our battery’s energy density, we used that extra allowable voltage for fast-charging,” Dr. Almheiri shared. The MI researchers published their results in a paper earlier this month in the Journal of Materials Chemistry A."</em> <a href="https://news.masdar.ac.ae/explore-news/stories-by-type/innovation/item/9892-new-fast-charging-flow-battery-aims-to-advance-the-state-of-the-art-in-energy-storage.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"When organic chemists identify a useful chemical compound — a new drug, for instance — it’s up to chemical engineers to determine how to mass-produce it. There could be 100 different sequences of reactions that yield the same end product. But some of them use cheaper reagents and lower temperatures than others, and perhaps most importantly, some are much easier to run continuously, with technicians occasionally topping up reagents in different reaction chambers. Historically, determining the most efficient and cost-effective way to produce a given molecule has been as much art as science. But MIT researchers are trying to put this process on a more secure empirical footing, with a computer system that’s trained on thousands of examples of experimental reactions and that learns to predict what a reaction’s major products will be. The researchers’ work appears in the American Chemical Society’s journal Central Science. Like all machine-learning systems, theirs presents its results in terms of probabilities. In tests, the system was able to predict a reaction’s major product 72 percent of the time; 87 percent of the time, it ranked the major product among its three most likely results."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/computer-system-predicts-products-chemical-reactions-0627">[...]</a>

<p><em>"By focusing laser light to a brightness 1 billion times greater than the surface of the sun — the brightest light ever produced on Earth — the physicists have observed changes in a vision-enabling interaction between light and matter. Those changes yielded unique X-ray pulses with the potential to generate extremely high-resolution imagery useful for medical, engineering, scientific and security purposes. The team’s findings, detailed June 26 in the journal Nature Photonics, should also help inform future experiments involving high-intensity lasers. Donald Umstadter and colleagues at the university’s Extreme Light Laboratory fired their Diocles Laser at helium-suspended electrons to measure how the laser’s photons — considered both particles and waves of light — scattered from a single electron after striking it. Under typical conditions, as when light from a bulb or the sun strikes a surface, that scattering phenomenon makes vision possible. But an electron — the negatively charged particle present in matter-forming atoms — normally scatters just one photon of light at a time. And the average electron rarely enjoys even that privilege, Umstadter said, getting struck only once every four months or so. Though previous laser-based experiments had scattered a few photons from the same electron, Umstadter’s team managed to scatter nearly 1,000 photons at a time. At the ultra-high intensities produced by the laser, both the photons and electron behaved much differently than usual."</em> <a href="http://news.unl.edu/newsrooms/today/article/1-billion-suns-world-s-brightest-laser-sparks-new-behavior-in-light/">[...]</a>

If we could program robots with similar versatility, it would open up many possibilities: Imagine machines that could fly into construction areas or disaster zones that aren’t near roads and then squeeze through tight spaces on the ground to transport objects or rescue people. The problem is that robots that are good at one mode of transportation are usually bad at another. Airborne drones are fast and agile, but generally have too limited of a battery life to travel for long distances. Ground vehicles, on the other hand, are more energy efficient, but slower and less mobile. Researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) are aiming to develop robots that can both maneuver around on land and take to the skies.

<p><em>"3D printers have been around since the 1980s, but we are still far from maximizing their potential. One active area of research and development is “self-actuating” objects: flat materials that transform themselves through material forces into the desired 3D object. Previously, however, the range of objects was limited to those with sharp edges and little, if any, curvature, and the transformation methods were based primarily on folding or processes that could not be controlled very precisely (e.g. chemical reactions or inflation). Now, for the first time, a group of current and former IST Austria computer scientists have made it possible to create self-actuating, smooth, free-form objects. In so doing, they developed both an ingenious material design and a new method of self-transformation—they call the fruits of their innovation “CurveUps”. Moreover, the team, which consists of Ruslan Guseinov, Eder Miguel, and Bernd Bickel, developed the computational tools to take a user-provided 3D model and automatically create a 2D flattened template that, upon release, transforms into the original 3D version. The goal of the project was ambitious in a number of ways. First, it is very challenging to obtain a final 3D object that is mechanically stable. Moreover, the team had to develop a controllable mechanism to accomplish this. “I experimented with so many different materials and methods before coming up with our current design,” says first author Ruslan Guseinov. CurveUps are made up of tiny tiles sandwiched between pre-stretched latex layers. During the transformation process, the tension in the latex pulls the tiles together joining them into a continuous shell. An innovative design and transformation method were only part of the team’s contribution, however. With these ideas in hand, the team focused on developing tools to create the 2D templates for printing. In particular, their program takes a user-supplied 3D form, and automatically generates a 2D tile layout, including the orientation, location and shape of each tile and connecting pins. However, as even small models will have hundreds or thousands of individual tiles, this represents an optimization problem of tremendous proportions—infeasible, on any personal computer. To get around this, the group implemented a two-step optimization procedure, which first gives an approximate solution, then performs local refinements before producing a final template. The entire procedure, from 3D model to a CurveUp, can be viewed online here. CurveUps are not just technically and mathematically impressive, they represent an important breakthrough in terms of 3D printing. “Our research is a step toward the development of new fabrication technologies: there have been many advances in flat fabrication, for instance in electronics, that have previously been limited to 2D shapes,” Ruslan Guseinov explains. “With CurveUps, we make it possible to produce 3D objects empowered with these same technologies, pushing the limits of digital manufacturing far beyond the current state.”"</em> <a href="http://ist.ac.at/news-media/news/news-detail/article/ahead-of-the-curve/6/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"MIT researchers have identified the proper temperature and chemical mixture to selectively separate pure copper and other metallic trace elements from sulfur-based minerals using molten electrolysis. This one-step, environmentally friendly process simplifies metal production and eliminates the toxic byproducts such as sulfur dioxide. Postdoc Sulata K. Sahu and PhD student Brian J. Chmielowiec ’12 decomposed sulfur-rich minerals into pure sulfur and extracted three different metals at very high purity: copper, molybdenum, and rhenium. They also quantified the amount of energy needed to run the extraction process. An electrolysis cell is a closed circuit, like a battery, but instead of producing electrical energy, it consumes electrical energy to break apart compounds into their elements, for example, splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen. Such electrolytic processes are the primary method of aluminum production and are used as the final step to remove impurities in copper production. Contrary to aluminum, however, there are no direct electrolytic decomposition processes for copper-containing sulfide minerals to produce liquid copper. The MIT researchers found a promising method of forming liquid copper metal and sulfur gas in their cell from an electrolyte composed of barium sulfide, lanthanum sulfide, and copper sulfide, which yields greater than 99.9 percent pure copper. This purity is equivalent to the best current copper production methods. Their results are published in an Electrochimica Acta paper with senior author Antoine Allanore, assistant professor of metallurgy."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/new-way-of-extracting-copper-0628">[...]</a>

This debris poses a threat to satellites, space vehicles and astronauts aboard those vehicles. What makes tidying up especially challenging is that the debris exists in space. Suction cups don’t work in a vacuum. Traditional sticky substances, like tape, are largely useless because the chemicals they rely on can’t withstand the extreme temperature swings. Magnets only work on objects that are magnetic. Most proposed solutions, including debris harpoons, either require or cause forceful interaction with the debris, which could push those objects in unintended, unpredictable directions.

<p><em>"Dialysis, in the most general sense, is the process by which molecules filter out of one solution, by diffusing through a membrane, into a more dilute solution. Outside of hemodialysis, which removes waste from blood, scientists use dialysis to purify drugs, remove residue from chemical solutions, and isolate molecules for medical diagnosis, typically by allowing the materials to pass through a porous membrane. Today’s commercial dialysis membranes separate molecules slowly, in part due to their makeup: They are relatively thick, and the pores that tunnel through such dense membranes do so in winding paths, making it difficult for target molecules to quickly pass through. Now MIT engineers have fabricated a functional dialysis membrane from a sheet of graphene — a single layer of carbon atoms, linked end to end in hexagonal configuration like that of chicken wire. The graphene membrane, about the size of a fingernail, is less than 1 nanometer thick. (The thinnest existing memranes are about 20 nanometers thick.) The team’s membrane is able to filter out nanometer-sized molecules from aqueous solutions up to 10 times faster than state-of-the-art membranes, with the graphene itself being up to 100 times faster. While graphene has largely been explored for applications in electronics, Piran Kidambi, a postdoc in MIT’s Department of Mechanical Engineering, says the team’s findings demonstrate that graphene may improve membrane technology, particularly for lab-scale separation processes and potentially for hemodialysis."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/scientists-produce-dialysis-membrane-made-from-graphene-0628">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A team including several Carnegie scientists has developed a form of ultrastrong, lightweight carbon that is also elastic and electrically conductive. A material with such a unique combination of properties could serve a wide variety of applications from aerospace engineering to military armor. Carbon is an element of seemingly infinite possibilities. This is because the configuration of its electrons allows for numerous self-bonding combinations that give rise to a range of materials with varying properties. For example, transparent, superhard diamonds, and opaque graphite, which is used for both pencils and industrial lubricant, are comprised solely of carbon. In this international collaboration between Yanshan University and Carnegie—which included Carnegie’s Zhisheng Zhao, Timothy Strobel, Yoshio Kono, Jinfu Shu, Ho-kwang “Dave” Mao, Yingwei Fei, and Guoyin Shen— scientists pressurized and heated a structurally disordered form of carbon called glassy carbon. The glassy carbon starting material was brought to about 250,000 times normal atmospheric pressure and heated to approximately 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit to create the new strong and elastic carbon. Their findings are published by Science Advances. Scientists had previously tried subjecting glassy carbon to high pressures at both room temperature (referred to as cold compression) and extremely high temperatures. But the so-called cold-synthesized material could not maintain its structure when brought back to ambient pressure, and under the extremely hot conditions, nanocrystalline diamonds were formed. The newly created carbon is comprised of both graphite-like and diamond-like bonding motifs, which gives rise to the unique combination of properties. Under the high-pressure synthesis conditions, disordered layers within the glassy carbon buckle, merge, and connect in various ways. This process creates an overall structure that lacks a long-range spatial order, but has a short-range spatial organization on the nanometer scale."</em> <a href="https://carnegiescience.edu/news/new-form-carbon-%E2%80%99s-hard-rock-yet-elastic-rubber">[...]</a>

<p><em>"I'd like to show you my homemade multi-channel-analyzer for gamma spectroscopy using a.) the freeware theremino and b.) an arduino. First of all I have to say some words about gamma spectroscopy at all. To detect radioactive decays you need a detector like a geiger-Counter. For gamma-spectroscopy you have to take a photomultiplier combined with a scintillation crystal made of sodium Iodide. You can get both things on ebay for less than 100 USD. The gamma-rays from the radioactive source is going through the scintillation crystal and produce very faint light-flashes. Those light-flashes are recorded by the photomultiplier, who converts them is small voltage-pulses at the Output. For this the photomultiplier and the Crystal have to be in a absolutely light-tight housing. I use shrinkable tubing for that. The Job of the multi-channel-analyzer (MCA) is to measure the height of those pulses coming from the photomultiplier. This is because every gamma-photon produces a voltage-pulse with a height depending on it's energy. The higher the energy of the gamma-photon, the higher the voltage pulse. When the pulse-height has been measured, the number pulses with this recorded amplitude can be increased by one. At the end you get a spectrum of number of pulses versus pulse-height, which is characteristic for each radioactive element. For example cesium-137 emits gama-rays with an energy of 662 keV. They will produce pulses with a certain pulse-height. With a MCA you'll get a spectrum with a peak at a certain voltage corresponding to the pulse-height. Therefore you can identify radioactive sources with a MCA. You don't get just the so called photo-peak, but also characteristic structures like the compton-edge, which is produced by the scattered electrons."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Multi-Channel-Analyzer-for-Gamma-Spectroscopy-With/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Intelligent Power Module (IPM) board has been designed using FSBS5CH60 IC from Fairchild, which provides a fully-featured, high-performance inverter output stage for AC Induction, BLDC, and PMSM motors. These modules integrate optimized gate drive of the built-in IGBTs to minimize EMI and losses, while also providing multiple on-module protection features including under-voltage lockouts, over-current shutdown, and fault reporting. The built-in, high-speed HVIC requires only a single supply voltage and translates the incoming logic-level gate inputs to the high-voltage, high-current drive signals required to properly drive the module’s internal IGBTs. Separate negative IGBT terminals are connected to shunt resistor to provide the current feedback to the micro-controller. This IPM module helps to develop lots of power applications and also can be used as H-Bridge for brushed DC motor. The module is manly helps to drive Hall sensor based or encoder based motors, it doesn’t support FOC algorithm, FOC based IPM board is under development and will be publish soon. This  board designed to evaluate Fairchild Semiconductor’s FSBS5CH60. The motion SPM is installed as the motor power module on the board to drive a three-phase AC Induction Motor (ACIM), Brushless DC (BLDC) motor, Brushless AC (BLAC) motor, or Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM). The board has bulk capacitors and microcontroller (MCU) interface circuitry. As this board is designed for a wide variety of motor types, not all included circuitry is required for all types of motors. Some motor types may require some additional circuitry be added, depending on the control algorithms being implemented. The board is designed to connect DC power sources feeding current to the motor. The three-phase motor output terminals (U-M1, V-M2, W-M3) from the screw terminal should be connected to the motor windings. Three bootstrap power supply circuits are designed into the board, one per phase. A bootstrap capacitor, charge resistor for charging the capacitor, and the blocking diode for high-voltage isolation make up each bootstrap supply. The microcontroller (MCU) or motion-controller development board connects to this IPM board via the provided 16 Pin header connector. Six low-pass filters are used between the signal input connector and the gate input signal pins of the IC. Short-circuit current protection is provided by a single shunt resistor, op amp, and low-pass filter. Additional resistor divider circuitry is included to monitor bus voltage, inverter phase current, and module temperature. This board is made for low voltage motor up to 90V DC load up to 5Amps, however it can be used for higher voltage motor up to 400V DC by changing bulk capacitor, refer note for more details.  Two 4mm holes provided to mount heat-sink on top of the IC. Board also has 28-40 Pin PIC Micro-Controller and DSpic shield which helps easy interface with many PIC micro-controllers and Motor DSpics. 16 PIN  header connector can be hookup to any port pin of PIC/DSpic development board using female to female wire harness."</em>  <a href="http://www.electronics-lab.com/project/inteligent-power-module-ipm-board-brushless-motors/">[...]</a>

The battery-powered circuit draws virtually no current when the sensor is dry and the current consumption is low when the buzzer is activated so a couple of AA cells will last a long time. Alternately, a molded power supply with a simple voltage regulator to drop the voltage to 3 volts could be used. The circuit is basically a handy flasher circuit that operates well on only 3 volts using ordinary silicon transistors. When the circuit is triggered, the buzzer is pulsed about once per second for a very short time, giving it a "dripping water" sound which seems appropriate. A slower, longer beep may be had by increasing the 1 uF capacitor. The 10 k resistor may be increased for a longer beep time without decreasing the beep rate but at some point the circuit will cease to function properly, depending on the gain of the transistors."</em> <a href="http://www.techlib.com/electronics/raindetectors.htm">[...]</a>

This chip is  way more powerful in terms of CPU architecture, clock frequency, flash size and power consumption if we compare it with existing arduino boards that usually contains Atmel's AVR controllers. Actually i bought this ESP-01 modules few years back which was originally flashed with good old serial AT command firmware. Over the time, I figured out that the same chip can be directly programmed through the Arduino IDE. This feature is so amazing that you can practically use all existing arduino libraries and the same IDE to program the ESP8266 according to your need by flashing your own arduino sketch. (Word of caution: It will remove your existing AT commands firmware from the chip). After experimenting a lot with typical IoT stuff like thingspeak API or Blynk platform, I stopped working with ESP8266 for few months. During this period, I learned about stuff related to penetration testing of Wi-Fi. If you want to know more about cracking WPA handshakes click here to know more because its certainly out of the scope of this post. I thought, it would be great to build a device which is able to deauth all nearby WiFi devices instead of running deauth attack from terminal by entering bunch of commands. Thus, once again, i decided to pull out my ESP8266 module from the drawer after long time!"</em> <a href="http://pranjalnrobotics.blogspot.pt/2017/06/esp8266-super-compact-wifi-snipper-for.html">[...]</a>

On both shoulders you will have an ultrasonic distance sensor that returns the distance which a servo (on the same shoulder) that presses a specific amount (depending on the distance), and when the item (thing that the distance sensor is seeing) comes too close a buzzer, on the same shoulder, beeps quietly just to emphasise that there is an object right next to your shoulder."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Assistive-Technology-for-the-Visually-Impa/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The project proposes a wireless-level sensor network for the enhancement of essential urban services. By means of an ultrasonic sensor it is possible to determine the distance of an object/obstacle from the sensor. In this way the level of liquids or solids can be determined with the same sensor. Immediate applications are listed below: Monitoring of water level in homes and buildings. In Brazil, there are regions where water supply is scarce (eg, northeast) and other regions with sporadic water crises (eg São Paulo 2014-2015). By knowing the level of the water reservoirs in a significant number of buildings it is possible to direct water to the most critical places, that is, to make an intelligent water management. In addition, the system can provide data to regulatory agencies and allow monitoring of the quality of the service, since the information disclosed by the sanitation companies does not always match what is reported by the population; Level monitoring of water in rain and river galleries (urban drainage). Several Brazilian cities suffer from flooding points, which causes great damage to the government and individuals. Through the continuous monitoring of the water level of rivers and storm drainage systems, it is possible to identify flood risk, clogging points and bottleneck points in drainage. This makes possible the intelligent management of the urban drainage and management system; Level monitoring of garbage in dumps or litter bins arranged in city streets. The collection of urban waste is an essential service for the control of diseases, for the well being of the population and for environmental management. Moving a collection team to empty dumps creates unnecessary cost; on the other hand, leaving a dump with waste for a long time causes problems due to the deterioration of the present materials. By knowing the filling state of the dumps, dump buckets and collection points, the person responsible for the collection can trace an efficient route and also ensure that the collection time is fulfilled. Efficient routes mean less spending on fuel, staff and fleet reduction."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Inteligent-Level-Sensors-Network/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Now this is a story all about how my life got flipped, turned- whoops, so sorry; wrong story. This is actually a story about a project I've been dreaming of working on since I first learned about Arduino and open source: a MIDI controller inspired by the MIDI Fighter by DJ Tech Tools, complete with light-up arcade buttons. It took a while for my skills to catch up to my project aspirations though, so finally, a few years later, I've built my version of a DIY MIDI Fighter. Now obviously this isn't an original concept to make. You can find quite a few different ones by different makers all over the internet, but what I think is awesome about this project is that no single MIDI Fighter is the same, whether it be hardware hook-up, final housing or code iteration. Even the microcontrollers vary. So with all of that, here is my humble version. I hope that my work helps you with your own open source MIDI explorations."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/BlitzCityDIY/arduino-midi-fighter-8e8a5a">[...]</a>

<p><em>"After working with the user group on earlier version's of braille keyboards, it was highlighted that there is no comprehensive way of typing into a smartphone. Current software solutions are too slow, do not give good tactile feedback or just are a pain to type with. Even though there are many soft keyboards available, we couldn't find someone in our study group who uses any of the soft keyboards. In our study conducted, out of 10 people, 7 use "Feature Phones", and the rest had smartphones but would take the help of a colleague or family member to type. It was the tactile buttons and not the cost that caused them to use feature phones. Thus it was concluded that it is necessary to have a tactile keyboard in order for more visually impaired to use a smartphone. The other challenge is faced by those who have recently lost their sight, and do not know how to use braille. A fast and efficient way in which this group of people can learn braille, is important"</em> <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/21175-tipo-braille-smartphone-keypad">[...]</a>
