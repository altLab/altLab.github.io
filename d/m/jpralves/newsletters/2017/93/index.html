<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Maybach">Wilhelm Maybach</a>. Este industrial alemão nasceu a 1846 em Württemberg. Juntamente com <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottlieb_Daimler">Gottlieb Daimler</a> criaram em 1885, o primeiro carburador que misturava gasolina evaporada com ar para permitir o seu uso eficiente como combustível.</p>

<p>Esta semana ficámos a saber que uma equipa de cientistas da NASA desenvolveu um chip capaz de funcionar na superfície de Vénus. Este desenvolvimento vem permitir que no futuro se possam fazer missões para exploração da superfície deste planeta nosso vizinho. A Intel vai gastar cerca de 7 mil milhões de dólares na construção de uma fábrica de semicondutores. Esta deverá estar pronta dentro de 3 ou 4 anos e estará preparada para a fabricação de chip de 7 nm. A Intel apresentou uma biblioteca open source para Deep Learning. Designada por BigDL esta biblioteca foi desenhada para funcionar na Framework de computação em cluster Apache Spark.</p>

<p>Esta semana também começaram a surgir relatórios de um numero anormalmente alto de falhas de equipamento com o processador Atom C2000 da Intel. A Intel, na revisão da sua documentação da família de chips, indicou que estes têm um problema com o relógio. Esta é uma falha catastrófica que pode inutilizar completamente o equipamento. Trata-se de um problema em que a solução passa pela substituição do hardware.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como alguns modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis. É apresentado também um livro sobre Fundamentos de Bases de Dados.</p>

<p><em>"Venus is one of the most inhospitable places in the solar system. Descending through the clouds of boiling sulphuric rain is actually the easy bit—the hard bit is not being cremated by the surface temperature of 470°C (878°F) or crushed by the atmospheric pressure, which is about 90 times that of Earth, the same as swimming 900 metres under water. The longest survival time for a human-made object on Venus was 127 minutes, back in 1981 when the Soviet spacecraft Venera 13 landed there. Not dying for two hours, and netting our first ever colour photos of the planet's surface, was considered a huge success; the probe had only been designed to live for 32 minutes before it was cooked, crushed, and dissolved by its environs. Three more spacecraft followed, all Soviet—Venera 14, Vega 1, Vega 2—but we haven't tried to land anything on Venus since 1985."</em> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/02/venus-computer-chip/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Intel Corporation today announced plans to invest more than $7 billion to complete Fab 42, which is expected to be the most advanced semiconductor factory in the world. The high-volume factory is in Chandler, Ariz., and is targeted to use the 7 nanometer (nm) manufacturing process. It will produce microprocessors to power data centers and hundreds of millions of smart and connected devices worldwide. The announcement was made by U.S. President Donald Trump and Intel CEO Brian Krzanich at the White House. The completion of Fab 42 in 3 to 4 years will directly create approximately 3,000 high-tech, high-wage Intel jobs for process engineers, equipment technicians, and facilities-support engineers and technicians who will work at the site. Combined with the indirect impact on businesses that will help support the factory’s operations, Fab 42 is expected to create more than 10,000 total long-term jobs in Arizona."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/intel-supports-american-innovation-7-billion-investment-next-generation-semiconductor-factory-arizona/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"The closest comet approach in decades will give skywatchers something to hunt for as a lunar eclipse obliges by darkening the light of the "snow moon." Even if you aren't a space nerd whose idea of a good time is craning your neck to stare into the vast nothingness of space on a frigid evening, this Friday the heavens will put on a show worth heading outdoors for. A penumbral lunar eclipse, a full "snow moon" and a comet will be spicing up the night sky February 10 in a rare convergence of such celestial happenings. We'll start with our nearest neighbor. February brings the full moon known as the "snow moon" because this month in North America tends to see a lot of the white fluffy stuff. This snow moon will be special though because, well... we'll all get in its way in a sense when the penumbral lunar eclipse takes place Friday. The eclipse will be at least partly visible from most but not all places on Earth (sorry Australia and Japan). The moment of greatest eclipse is at 4:43 p.m. PT and the eclipse will then dissipate until it completes a little over two hours later, according to the U.S. Naval Observatory."</em> <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/comet-45p-snow-moon-lunar-eclipse-february-2017/">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/newsandevents/index?id=38900">First ever blueprint unveiled to construct a large scale quantum computer</a></h2>

<p><em>"An international team, led by a scientist from the University of Sussex, have today unveiled the first practical blueprint for how to build a quantum computer, the most powerful computer on Earth. This huge leap forward towards creating a universal quantum computer is published today (1 February 2017) in the influential journal Science Advances. It has long been known that such a computer would revolutionise industry, science and commerce on a similar scale as the invention of ordinary computers. But this new work features the actual industrial blueprint to construct such a large-scale machine, more powerful in solving certain problems than any computer ever constructed before. Once built, the computer’s capabilities mean it would have the potential to answer many questions in science; create new, lifesaving medicines; solve the most mind-boggling scientific problems; unravel the yet unknown mysteries of the furthest reaches of deepest space; and solve some problems that an ordinary computer would take billions of years to compute."</em> <a href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/newsandevents/index?id=38900">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"With electrical cables reaching their limits, optical connections like fiberglass are increasingly becoming the standard for data traffic. Over longer distances almost all data transmission is optical. Within computer systems and microchips, too, the growth of data traffic is exponential, but that traffic is still electronic, and this is increasingly becoming a bottleneck. Since these connections (‘interconnects’) account for the majority of the energy consumed by chips, many scientists around the world are working on enabling optical (photonic) interconnects. Crucial to this is the light source that converts the data into light signals which must be small enough to fit into the microscopic structures of microchips. At the same time, the output capacity and efficiency have to be good. Especially the efficiency is a challenge, as small light sources, powered by nano- or microwatts, have always performed very inefficiently to date."</em> <a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/university/news-and-press/news/02-02-2017-1000-times-more-efficient-nano-led-opens-door-to-faster-microchips/">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="https://www.fraunhofer.de/en/press/research-news/2017/february/watching-computers-think.html">Watching computers think</a></h2>

<p><em>"Neural networks are commonly used today to analyze complex data – for instance to find clues to illnesses in genetic information. Ultimately, though, no one knows how these networks actually work exactly. That is why Fraunhofer researchers developed software that enables them to look into these black boxes and analyze how they function. The researchers will present their software at CeBIT in Hannover from March 20 to 24, 2017 (Hall 6, Booth B 36). The problem is that it isn’t just researchers who currently don’t know exactly how neural networks function step by step, or why they reach one result or another. Neural networks are, in a sense, black boxes – computer programs that people feed values into and that reliably return results. If you want to teach a neural network, for instance, to recognize cats, then you instruct the system by feeding it thousands of cat pictures. Just like a small child that slowly learns to distinguish cats from dogs, the neural network, too, learns automatically. “In many cases, though, researchers are less interested in the result and far more interested in what the neural network actually does – how it reaches decisions,” says Dr. Wojciech Samek, head of the Machine Learning Group at Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute HHI in Berlin. So Samek and his team, in collaboration with colleagues from TU Berlin, developed a method that makes it possible to watch a neural network think."</em> <a href="https://www.fraunhofer.de/en/press/research-news/2017/february/watching-computers-think.html">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine have developed a way to produce a cheap and reusable diagnostic “lab on a chip” with the help of an ordinary inkjet printer. At a production cost of as little as 1 cent per chip, the new technology could usher in a medical diagnostics revolution like the kind brought on by low-cost genome sequencing, said Ron Davis, PhD, professor of biochemistry and of genetics and director of the Stanford Genome Technology Center. A study describing the technology was published online Feb. 6 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Davis is the senior author. The lead author is Rahim Esfandyarpour, PhD, an engineering research associate at the genome center. The inexpensive lab-on-a-chip technology has the potential to enhance diagnostic capabilities around the world, especially in developing countries. Due to inferior access to early diagnostics, the survival rate of breast cancer patients is only 40 percent in low-income nations — half the rate of such patients in developed nations. Other lethal diseases, such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV, also have high incidence and bad patient outcomes in developing countries. Better access to cheap diagnostics could help turn this around, especially as most such equipment costs thousands of dollars."</em> <a href="http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2017/02/scientists-develop-lab-on-a-chip-that-costs-1-cent-to-make.html">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Nature does amazing things with limited design materials. Grass, for example, can support its own weight, resist strong wind loads, and recover after being compressed. The plant’s hardiness comes from a combination of its hollow, tubular macrostructure and porous, or cellular, microstructure. These architectural features work together to give grass its robust mechanical properties. Inspired by natural cellular structures, researchers at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University, the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), and MIT have developed a new method to 3D print materials with independently tunable macro-and microscale porosity using a ceramic foam ink."</em> <a href="https://wyss.harvard.edu/mimicking-natures-cellular-architectures-via-3d-printing/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"As we saw during the 2016 US election, protecting traditional computer systems, which use zeros and ones, from hackers is not a perfect science. Now consider the complex world of quantum computing, where bits of information can simultaneously hold multiple states beyond zero and one, and the potential threats become even trickier to tackle. Even so, researchers at the University of Ottawa have uncovered clues that could help administrators protect quantum computing networks from external attacks. “Our team has built the first high-dimensional quantum cloning machine capable of performing quantum hacking to intercept a secure quantum message,” said University of Ottawa Department of Physics professor Ebrahim Karimi, who holds the Canada Research Chair in Structured Light. “Once we were able to analyze the results, we discovered some very important clues to help protect quantum computing networks against potential hacking threats.”"</em> <a href="http://research.uottawa.ca/news/protecting-quantum-computing-networks-against-hacking-threats">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Physicists at the University of Bonn have cleared a further hurdle on the path to creating quantum computers: in a recent study, they present a method with which they can very quickly and precisely sort large numbers of atoms. The work has now been published in “Physical Review Letters”. Imagine you are standing in a grocery store buying apple juice. Unfortunately, all of the crates are half empty because other customers have removed individual bottles at random. So you carefully fill your crate bottle by bottle. But wait: The neighboring crate is filled in exactly the opposite way! It has bottles where your crate has gaps. If you could lift these bottles in one hit and place them in your crate, it would be full straight away. You could save yourself a lot of work. Unfortunately, such solutions don’t (yet) exist for half-empty drinks crates. However, physicists at the University of Bonn want to sort thousands of atoms however they like in the future in this way – and in a matter of seconds. Around the world, scientists are currently looking for methods that enable sorting processes in the microcosm. The proposal by Bonn-based researchers could push the development of future quantum computers a crucial step forward. This allows atoms to interact with each other in a targeted manner in order to be able to exploit quantum-mechanical effects for calculations. In addition, the particles have to be brought into spatial proximity with one another."</em> <a href="https://www.uni-bonn.de/news/046-2017">[...]</a></p>

It measures the magnets in units called Gauss and has a relatively linear range from 0-4000 Gauss. It will measure beyond that but the numbers beyond 4000 Gauss should only be used for comparison purposes. In addition to measuring the field strength, it also detects the polarity of the magnet and will show North or South, respectively. My favorite part about this design is the ON/OFF switch. It's hidden in the enclosure so the meter can only be turned on and off with a magnet. Since this unit is meant to measure magnets, you're sure to have one on hand.

Its works in the following way: A stepper motor rotate 360º sideways, and when reaches the end, change the direction and rotate another 360º. The reason why the motor doesn't move is because is pinned to the base. While stepper motor is rotating, the ultrasonic sensor collects information constantly. This information is sent to Processing through the serial port. The program that we have created in Processing have two ways for representing the data collected. The first one is with lines and the second draws circles at the distance that ultrasonic sensor has detected the object. The representation mode it can be changed if we press key 'space bar'. When we change the representation mode, the radar is calibrates automatically with the encoder installed. At the starting, the radar doesn't do anything until the Processing code runs and send the signal to start. That way Arduino and Processing initiate at the same time.

However, the ESP8266 AT commands can be particularly tricky and, if not coded correctly, can result in lockups. The RIOT framework provides several functions that make using the ESP8266 a breeze. Firstly, it contains an interpreter for data going in and out of the ESP8266. Secondly, it provides simple and easy-to-use functions to get a microcontroller Wi-Fi enabled in almost no time. Thirdly, the code utilizes ROM memory as much as possible so that very-small-RAM micros (256 bytes of RAM, for example) can still be internet-enabled.

<p><em>"This video demonstrates using an ESP8266-12E and an OLED display as a digital clock. While clocks may be ubiquitous these days, this project demonstrates some useful concepts that can be used in a variety of applications. The Arduino IDE is used to develop a sketch that access a NPT time server to accurately set the date and time. The date and time are then displayed on an OLED display and also via a web browser accessing the ESP8266 web server. The web page allows the setting of options like Time Zone, 24 hour clock, daylight savings and a variable to control the time server update interval. The web page uses AJAX to update the time without reloading the entire web page. There is also a brief overview of the source code sketch in the video."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/ESP8266-OLED-Clock-IoT-Using-AJAX/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"All of you must have experienced this that you have something being cooked on your gas stove while on the other side you get busy watching TV or get a deep conversation that you realize on detecting a smell that it was completely spoiled just because of your carelessness. This little Arduino controlled device is a simple solution to the problem! This is basically a mini battery operated portable kitchen timer which can be set to any number of hours and minutes and tells you with buzzer beeps that the provided time is over. The buzzer is loud enough to be heard even in another room thus can save your dishes from turning burn black. Wonder how great would it be if you made one yourself? Here's how to! When talking about the inner workings, this project consists of Arduino as the brain, a Liquid crystal display to display time, a buzzer to notify you, two buttons to enter hours and minutes and two LEDs to acting as indicators. Apart from this, it is operated using a 9v battery thus making it small, light weight and portable. As you may have noticed, all of the parts are one of the most basic ones thus you won't have to hunt around. You can enter the number of hours as well as minutes which makes it an accurate device to suite your needs. You will require a maximum of two to three hours to make it."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Controlled-Kitchen-Timer/">[...]</a></p>

This project uses a Logic App to watch for a new tweet based on dynamic search terms. Upon triggering, a message containing the tweet content is sent to a Function app function which then send a messageto the device through an IoT Hub. The device will then send a reply back to the IoT Hub to, usually to inform the resource that the message was received and can be removed from the queue. The great thing about using a Logic App is that is has so many different connectors. So, if desired, the Logic App can be triggered when a new Facebook post occurs, when a new OneDrive document is uploaded, when a Wunderlist task reminder occurs, on a reoccuring timer, or when one of the many other options for triggers happens."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/kottofy/illuminate-me-6049b1">[...]</a></p>

This project is a simple implementation of this approach. A robot is controlled by voice commands. Voice command is taken through a microphone, processed in computer and sent to the robot and finally the robot acts accordingly. When we say voice control, the first term to be considered is Speech Recognition i.e. making the system to understand human voice. Speech recognition is a technology where the system understands the words (not its meaning) given through speech.

<p><em>"A computer's arithmetic-logic unit (ALU) is the heart of the processor, performing arithmetic and logic operations on data. If you've studied digital logic, you've probably learned how to combine simple binary adder circuits to build an ALU. However, the 8008's ALU uses clever logic circuits that can perform multiple operations efficiently. And unlike most 1970's microprocessors, the 8008 uses a complex carry-lookahead circuit to increase its performance. The 8008 was Intel's first 8-bit microprocessor, introduced 45 years ago.1 While primitive by today's standards, the 8008 is historically important because it essentially started the microprocessor revolution and is the ancestor of the x86 processor family that are probably using right now.2 I recently took some die photos of the 8008, which I described earlier. In this article, I reverse-engineer the 8008's ALU circuits from these die photos and explain how the ALU functions."</em> <a href="http://www.righto.com/2017/02/reverse-engineering-surprisingly.html">[...]</a></p>
