<p><em>"With two suns in its sky, Luke Skywalker's home planet Tatooine in "Star Wars" looks like a parched, sandy desert world. In real life, thanks to observatories such as NASA's Kepler space telescope, we know that two-star systems can indeed support planets, although planets discovered so far around double-star systems are large and gaseous. Scientists wondered: If an Earth-size planet were orbiting two suns, could it support life? It turns out, such a planet could be quite hospitable if located at the right distance from its two stars, and wouldn't necessarily even have deserts. In a particular range of distances from two sun-like host stars, a planet covered in water would remain habitable and retain its water for a long time, according to a new study in the journal Nature Communications."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6811">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/asteroid-to-fly-safely-past-earth-on-april-19">Asteroid to Fly Safely Past Earth on April 19</a></h2>

<p><em>"A relatively large near-Earth asteroid discovered nearly three years ago will fly safely past Earth on April 19 at a distance of about 1.1 million miles (1.8 million kilometers), or about 4.6 times the distance from Earth to the moon. Although there is no possibility for the asteroid to collide with our planet, this will be a very close approach for an asteroid of this size. The asteroid, known as 2014 JO25, was discovered in May 2014 by astronomers at the Catalina Sky Survey near Tucson, Arizona -- a project of NASA's NEO Observations Program in collaboration with the University of Arizona. (An NEO is a near-Earth object). Contemporary measurements by NASA's NEOWISE mission indicate that the asteroid is roughly 2,000 feet (650 meters) in size, and that its surface is about twice as reflective as that of the moon. At this time very little else is known about the object’s physical properties, even though its trajectory is well known. The asteroid will approach Earth from the direction of the sun and will become visible in the night sky after April 19. It is predicted to brighten to about magnitude 11, when it could be visible in small optical telescopes for one or two nights before it fades as the distance from Earth rapidly increases. Small asteroids pass within this distance of Earth several times each week, but this upcoming close approach is the closest by any known asteroid of this size, or larger, since asteroid Toutatis, a 3.1-mile (five-kilometer) asteroid, which approached within about four lunar distances in September 2004. The next known encounter of an asteroid of comparable size will occur in 2027 when the half-mile-wide (800-meter-wide) asteroid 1999 AN10 will fly by at one lunar distance, about 236,000 miles (380,000 kilometers)."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/asteroid-to-fly-safely-past-earth-on-april-19">[...]</a>

<p><em>"DeepMind’s AlphaGo program will test its artificial intelligence capabilities in May against top Go player Ke Jie. The match of three games in Wuzhen, China, between AlphaGo and the Chinese player comes about a year after the computer program beat by 4-1 a key player, the South Korean Lee Se-dol, in a game that is regarded as involving more complex strategy than chess. During the game, players take turns placing black or white pieces, called “stones,” on the 19-by-19 line grid. The aim is to capture the opponent's stones by surrounding them and encircling more empty space as territory. AlphaGo has been seen as a major contender because of its ability to learn from its experience, sometimes resulting in far-from-human but nevertheless successful moves."</em> <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/3188555/artificial-intelligence/ai-player-alphago-to-play-chinese-go-champion.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Back in 1996, a computer scientist called Lov Grover at Bell Labs in New Jersey unveiled an unusual algorithm for searching through a database. Searching algorithms are among the most important in computer science. They make possible mundane tasks such as hunting through phones books but also more exotic tasks such as breaking cryptographic codes. This kind of algorithm is ubiquitous in computer science. So any way of speeding up the task is hugely significant. A standard search takes a period of time that is roughly proportional to the number of elements in the search. That’s because, in the worst-case scenario, the algorithm has to search through all the elements to find just one. But Grover’s algorithm is different. The time it takes is proportional to the square root of the number of elements. Computer scientists call this a quadratic speed-up. And in a world where speed increases of a few fractions of a percent are hugely valuable, a quadratic speed-up is a towering achievement."</em> <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/604068/quantum-computing-now-has-a-powerful-search-tool/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Swirling objects known as magnetic vortices and skyrmions can be miniaturized without sacrificing mobility, a KAUST-led international research team has found. These findings are relevant for future “race-track” memory technologies that feature massive densities of moveable magnetic bits. In nanometer-thin magnetic films, such as iron-nickel alloys, the region separating two magnetic domains or defects can adopt tiny whirlpool-like patterns. Some of these patterns, called skyrmions, resist unraveling even when packed tightly together, and they can also be directed with small electric currents. These features have made the skyrmions attractive targets for research into high-capacity memory devices. One concept zips skyrmions around a loop then past a stationary read/write head to eliminate the need for mechanical components used in today’s hard drives. Aurelien Manchon, an Associate Professor of Material Science and Engineering at the University, notes that one of the main reasons for the appeal of skyrmions is their ability to avoid defects or uneven patches in thin films that would normally trap or “pin” a magnetic charge. However, this agility is compromised when researchers try to shrink skyrmions to the smallest size possible—the smaller they get the more likely they are to get pinned because of the relative increase in defect site dimensions."</em> <a href="https://discovery.kaust.edu.sa/en/article/339/information-storage-with-a-nanoscale-twist">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://engineering.columbia.edu/news/engineering-icons-david-shaw">David E. Shaw's Supercomputer Is Uncovering Secrets of Human Biology</a></h2>

<p><em>"David E. Shaw, the legendary quantitative investment manager turned innovator in computational biochemistry, spoke to a packed auditorium of Columbia Engineering students and described his research and development of high-speed simulations that could lead to better understanding of protein behavior and improvements in drug discovery for diseases like cancer and Alzheimer’s. Shaw was featured as part of the School’s “Engineering Icons” series, which brings leading experts who are having a major impact in different fields of engineering and the applied sciences to campus. Dean Mary C. Boyce introduced Shaw, referencing his time as a professor in Columbia’s Computer Science department in the 1980s before he became a forerunner in computational finance through his quantitative investment firm, D.E. Shaw Group. Since 2001, Shaw’s primary focus has been on efforts in molecular biology through D.E. Shaw Research (DESRES), where he is chief scientist. The evening began as a Q&amp;A between Dean Boyce and Shaw, who also holds an appointment as senior research fellow at the Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at Columbia University. Shaw showed several videos of high-speed molecular dynamics simulations performed by Anton, the specialized supercomputer built by his research group. Shaw noted that computer science has been a common thread guiding his multi-faceted career. A former teacher and mentor once counseled him to “stop trying to think of big ideas” and focus on the close study of a concrete application, since this often reveals fundamental problems whose solution leads naturally to new, big ideas."</em> <a href="http://engineering.columbia.edu/news/engineering-icons-david-shaw">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Two researchers at Heidelberg University have developed a model system that enables a better understanding of the processes in a quantum-physical experiment with ultracold atoms. Using computer-assisted methods, Prof. Dr Sandro Wimberger and David Fischer from the Institute for Theoretical Physics discovered physical laws that point to the universal properties of this system. Their results were published in the journal “Annalen der Physik”. Under certain conditions, small particles follow completely different physical laws than those we are accustomed to. “Observing such quantum-physical phenomena, however, is sometimes difficult and requires working with small and isolated systems and to investigate those. But perfect isolation from the environment is never possible, so external influences can easily destroy the fragile state of the quantum system,” explains primary author David Fischer, a student of physics at Heidelberg University. For experiments in this field, keeping such disruptions under control is of great interest. “This control enables us not only to ensure the coherence of the system, but it can also be used selectively to effect special conditions,” emphasises Prof. Wimberger."</em> <a href="https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/presse/news2017/pm20170406_quantum-physical-model-system.html">[...]</a>

For instance, when DNA is hit with ultraviolet light, it can lose excess energy from radiation by ejecting the core of a hydrogen atom — a single proton — to keep other chemical bonds in the system from breaking. To gain insight into this process, researchers used X-ray laser pulses from the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at the Department of Energy’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory to investigate how energy from light transforms a relatively simple molecule, 2-thiopyridone. This molecule undergoes a chemical transformation that also occurs in the building blocks of DNA. The scientists looked at this process by probing the nitrogen atom in the molecule with X-ray pulses that lasted just femtoseconds, or quadrillionths of a second. The results, published in Angewandte Chemie, are a step toward better understanding what’s called “excited state proton transfers” in DNA and other molecules."</em> <a href="https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/news/2017-04-06-scientists-watch-molecule-protect-itself-radiation-damage.aspx">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The pens holding cold-water fish in the fjords of Norway and quiet lochs of Scotland, whose depths are normally inky black after dark, now have an eerie night glow. There’s a perfectly rational explanation: Thousands of laser pulses are doing an important job, lighting up fish stocks in the latest bid to control a pesky parasite that can injure or even kill farmed salmon, and devastate an industry estimated to reel in about US $10 billion annually. The problem is sea lice, marine ectoparasites. Two particular sea lice species, Lepeophtheirus salmonis and Caligus elongatus, attach to salmon and sea trout, feeding off their tissues, blood, and protective external mucus membranes. Though the lice find the flesh and blood of wild and farmed fish equally palatable, the problem is particularly acute in densely populated salmon farm pens, where the parasites’ food source are collected in a stationary place. Most pens typically keep 50,000 to 150,000 fish swimming inside a mesh perimeter. So, while the lice are a relatively harmless problem for fast and free-moving wild fish, the captive host in the pens find themselves unable to escape the louse onslaught."</em> <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/optoelectronics/licehunting-underwater-drone-protects-salmon-with-lasers">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www2.cnrs.fr/en/2903.htm">Electronic synapses that can learn : towards an artificial brain ?</a></h2>

<p><em>"One of the goals of biomimetics is to take inspiration from the functioning of the brain in order to design increasingly intelligent machines. This principle is already at work in information technology, in the form of the algorithms used for completing certain tasks, such as image recognition; this, for instance, is what Facebook uses to identify photos. However, the procedure consumes a lot of energy. Vincent Garcia (Unité mixte de physique CNRS/Thales) and his colleagues have just taken a step forward in this area by creating directly on a chip an artificial synapse that is capable of learning. They have also developed a physical model that explains this learning capacity. This discovery opens the way to creating a network of synapses and hence intelligent systems requiring less time and energy. Our brain's learning process is linked to our synapses, which serve as connections between our neurons. The more the synapse is stimulated, the more the connection is reinforced and learning improved. Researchers took inspiration from this mechanism to design an artificial synapse, called a memristor. This electronic nanocomponent consists of a thin ferroelectric layer sandwiched between two electrodes, and whose resistance can be tuned using voltage pulses similar to those in neurons. If the resistance is low the synaptic connection will be strong, and if the resistance is high the connection will be weak. This capacity to adapt its resistance enables the synapse to learn."</em> <a href="http://www2.cnrs.fr/en/2903.htm">[...]</a>

Developed and fabricated by Aurora Flight Sciences, the revolutionary aircraft includes 24 electric ducted fans—18 distributed within the main wings and six in the canard surfaces, with the wings and canards tilting upwards for vertical flight and rotating to a horizontal position for wing-borne flight. The successful tests suggest there is a time in the not-so-distant future when VTOL aircraft could fly much faster and farther than any existing hover-capable craft, and take off and land almost anywhere. Subscale testing began on the VTOL program in March of 2016 and the first phase of testing ended after six flights with demonstration of auto take off, sustained hover, directional and translational control (including lateral and rearward flight), waypoint navigation, and auto landing. Later, the aircraft wing and canard tilt mechanisms, tilt schedules, and wing-borne flight controls were enabled for testing.

<p><em>"A new study from the international Daya Bay neutrino experiment in China may have found an answer for why there appear to be fewer neutrinos from nuclear reactors than predicted in theoretical models. The next step will be for Yale’s Wright Lab — which has been involved in the Daya Bay research for a number of years — to confirm whether that answer is correct. Neutrinos are thought to be fundamental particles in the universe. They do not carry an electrical charge and move through the universe almost entirely unaffected by natural forces. For years, scientists have devised elaborate experiments to detect the subatomic particles and better understand their behavior. Yale scientists were involved in the experiments that led to the discovery of neutrino oscillation. Yet since 2011, physicists have been faced with an anomaly: Experiments at nuclear reactors showed fewer antineutrinos (the antiparticles of neutrinos) being produced than models had predicted. One theory to explain the discrepancy was that neutrinos were morphing into an undetectable form known as “sterile” neutrinos. The new Daya Bay study proposes a simpler explanation: a miscalculation in the predicted rate of antineutrino production for one particular component of reactor fuel. During nuclear fission, antineutrinos carry away about 5% of the energy released as the uranium and plutonium atoms — which fuel the reactor — split. The composition of the fuel changes as the reactor operates, with the decays of different forms of uranium and plutonium (called isotopes) producing different numbers of antineutrinos with different energy ranges over time, even as the reactor steadily produces electrical power. The Daya Bay scientists found that antineutrinos produced by nuclear reactions from the fission of uranium-235 were inconsistent with predictions. Uranium-235 is an isotope that is common in nuclear fuel."</em> <a href="http://news.yale.edu/2017/04/05/yale-s-wright-lab-will-test-new-theory-solve-subatomic-mystery">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Two-dimensional materials, or 2D materials for short, are extremely versatile, although – or often more precisely because – they are made up of just one or a few layers of atoms. Graphene is the best-known 2D material.  Molybdenum disulphide (a layer consisting of molybdenum and sulphur atoms that is three-atoms thick) also falls in this category, although, unlike graphene, it has semiconductor properties. With his team, Dr Thomas Mueller from the Photonics Institute at TU Wien is conducting research into 2D materials, viewing them as a promising alternative for the future production of microprocessors and other integrated circuits. Microprocessors are an indispensable and ubiquitous component in the modern world. Without their continued development, many of the things we take for granted these days, such as computers, mobile phones and the internet, would not be possible at all. However, while silicon has always been used in the production of microprocessors, it is now slowly but surely approaching its physical limits. 2D materials, including molybdenum disulphide, are showing promise as potential replacements. Although research into individual transistors – the most basic components of every digital circuit – made of 2D materials has been under way since graphene was first discovered back in 2004, success in creating more complex structures has been very limited. To date, it has only been possible to produce individual digital components using a few transistors. In order to achieve a microprocessor that operates independently, however, much more complex circuits are required which, in addition also need to interact flawlessly."</em> <a href="https://www.tuwien.ac.at/en/news/news_detail/article/124895/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Last year, a strange self-driving car was released onto the quiet roads of Monmouth County, New Jersey. The experimental vehicle, developed by researchers at the chip maker Nvidia, didn’t look different from other autonomous cars, but it was unlike anything demonstrated by Google, Tesla, or General Motors, and it showed the rising power of artificial intelligence. The car didn’t follow a single instruction provided by an engineer or programmer. Instead, it relied entirely on an algorithm that had taught itself to drive by watching a human do it. Getting a car to drive this way was an impressive feat. But it’s also a bit unsettling, since it isn’t completely clear how the car makes its decisions. Information from the vehicle’s sensors goes straight into a huge network of artificial neurons that process the data and then deliver the commands required to operate the steering wheel, the brakes, and other systems. The result seems to match the responses you’d expect from a human driver. But what if one day it did something unexpected—crashed into a tree, or sat at a green light? As things stand now, it might be difficult to find out why. The system is so complicated that even the engineers who designed it may struggle to isolate the reason for any single action. And you can’t ask it: there is no obvious way to design such a system so that it could always explain why it did what it did."</em> <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/604087/the-dark-secret-at-the-heart-of-ai/?set=604130">[...]</a>

<p><em>"I'm developing the Falling-Up Robot (F.U.R.), a very tall balancing inverted pendulum bot, using the Teensy 3.6 microcontroller with the Arduino IDE 1.6.12. I want to learn feedback control systems through practice on an inherently unstable system. It's 6 feet tall to stand with you and so I can tinker with the main board at desk level. So far, the brain and chassis is in place, and the basic balancing control system is active to keep it from falling over. I used stepper motors to take advantage of high torque at low RPM and zero backlash. This allows very steady stand-still performance. But dealing with the stepper-induced mechanical vibration was an issue. This was mostly solved with analog filters on the IMU and with an Extended Kalman Filter in software."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/escape-velocity-labs/falling-up-robot-with-stepper-motors-0004c0">[...]</a>

I purchased a SIM800L module locally, and ended up playing with the different commands of the module. Using the Arduino Uno and the Arduino IDE, I was able to turn my ideas into reality. This did not come easy, with the SINGLE BIGGEST ISSUE being the limitation of only 2KB SRAM. After a lot of research on the internet and different forums, I was able to overcome this limitation. Different programming techniques, a much better understanding of the Arduino compiler, and using the SIM card and EEPROM for additional memory, saved this project. After some changes to the code, a stable prototype was build and tested over a period of a week. A drawback of the limited SRAM was that the unit could not be fitted with a display and user keys. This resulted in a complete rewrite of the code. With no user interface, the only option left to continue with the project, was to make use of SMS messages to configure the unit, as well as the users. This turned out to be an exciting project, and more futures were added as the development continued. My main goal was to stick with the Arduino Uno, or in this case, the ATMEGA328p, and not use any surface mount components.

<p><em>"Discharging capacitors is often necessary when working on troubleshooting and repair of electronic equipment. In the old days, tube radios and amplifiers found in every households contained capacitors that continued to hold dangerous levels of charge long after the appliance had been taken off the mains. Then it was CRT televisions, but now that televisions are LED flat screen it looks like everything has turned to low-voltage digital circuitry, so what is the problem? Well, the actual devices may be low-voltage, but the associated power supplies just got from dangerous (tube era B+ supplies) to (relatively) safe (transistorized equipment with linear power supplies) to dangerous again. The culprit today is the switched mode power supply, the efficient and lightweight modern king of power conversion for electronic equipment. A switched mode power supply is based on an input stage that rectifies the mains voltage, yielding a direct voltage of around 330 V (for 230 V mains voltage, 170 V for 120 V mains voltage) for further use by the circuit.

<p><em>"Given the growth of IoT applications using the MQTT protocol as a base and the Node-RED platform, we have created a possibility for industrial devices or devices using Modbus RTU protocol (RS232 or RS485) to interact with applications or IoT platforms that use MQTT in This Node-RED case. In the industry there is a large number of Monitoring and Control Devices that have Modbus RTU such as Counters, Meters (Flow, Electrical, Temperature, Humidity, etc.), Industrial Controllers PLC, PAC, HMI Screens, Speed ​​Inverters, For which the only possibility of extracting and concentrating data through OPC servers."</em> <a href="http://en.trialcommand.com/blog/gateway-esp8266-modbus-rtu-mqtt-hmi-industrial-panasonic/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Four technical innovations made this project possible: The 1977 Rowe AMI Jukebox, PlotClock robot arm kit, WeMos/ESP 8266 microcontroller and Blynk App/Cloud service. NOTE: If you don’t have the Jukebox at hand – don’t stop reading! This project can easily be adopted to control various things controlled by human fingers. One example could be a robot finger playing traditional Xylophone – maybe that instructable comes from you! My 40 years old Rowe AMI R-81 Jukebox is still working fine playing vintage vinyl singles from 60’s, 70’ and 80’s. Weighting over 160 kg (360 lbs) this player is not quite as portable as modern mp-players, but living at internet era, it is now possible to carry the jukebox and 200 vinyl records in your pocket – virtually of course! And you can even use your own playlists stored in the microcontroller! Amazing PlotClock robot is originally designed to show current time by drawing time digits on the erasable board. My adaptation for PlotClock is to use it as a robot finger for pressing Jukebox song selection buttons. The Plotclock ”finger” is driven by 3 servos controlled by WeMos microcontroller. This piece of wonder is (almost) Arduino Uno compatible and has WiFi capabilities, so it is possible to control the jukebox wirelessly from anywhere in the world. The cream on the cake comes from the incredible easy to use Blynk App and their Blynk Cloud Server giving a nice mobile phone/tablet user interface with full mobility."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/PlotClock-WeMos-and-Blynk-Playing-Vintage-AMI-Juke/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"I have been mirroring two 1TB hard drives in my PC as a media share for the past several years but my BIOS recently started giving me a S.M.A.R.T. error every time I booted warning me that one of my drives was about to fail. I could have just replaced the faulty drive but decided instead to upgrade to two new 3TB drives and use the old drives as galvanometers for a music-responsive laser projector. Back in the 90's I came across a device in a music store that was enclosed in a plastic case about half the height of a shoebox that had a mirror connected to a voice coil with a lamp behind a red filter and lens that focused the beam on the mirror so that it produced a red dot that would move to the beat of the music. It wasn't a laser but it worked really well. I don't know what happened to it and can't find it referenced anywhere on the Internet but I decided to recreate it. I searched the Internet and found several DIY laser projection systems. This one uses old hard drives and a red laser and this one uses hard drives and an Arduino controller to change the color of an RGB laser. I decided to use just a red laser and leave the components exposed."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Music-laser-light-show/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"8 player quiz buzzer can be used in various competition organise in school and colleges to identify the team who has pressed the buzzer first. Advantage of this quiz buzzer circuit is once a team has press the switch others team may press the switch but only number. displayed on display who press switch first. So with the help of this circuit we can easily identify the contestant who has press the switch first. Let build the circuit using a ARDUINO NANO which read the input from push buttons and displays the corresponding number on a display device. It is a simple circuit with minimum number of components and easily can build. The ARDUINO takes into account the time delay between two buttons and the accurate number is displayed. When one of the buttons is pressed, the buzzer starts ringing and the corresponding number is displayed on the 7 segment display."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/8-Player-Quizz-Buzzer-System-Using-Arduino/">[...]</a>
