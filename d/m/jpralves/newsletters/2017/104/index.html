<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia em 1896 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_Carothers">Wallace Carothers</a>. Este químico Norte-Americano ficou conhecido pela sua invenção do neopreno e do nylon. Faz também anos <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Morse">Samuel Morse</a>. Este Norte-americano, nascido em 1791 no estado do Massachusetts ficou conhecido pela invenção do sistema de codificação Morse. O código Morse foi desenvolvido de modo a que os operadores pudessem traduzir as indentações marcadas na fita de papel em mensagens de texto. No seu código mais antigo, Morse tinha planeado transmitir apenas números e usar um livro de códigos para procurar cada palavra de acordo com o número que tinha sido enviado. Entretanto, o código foi expandido posteriormente por Alfred Vail em 1840 para incluir letras e caracteres especiais, assim que poderia ser usado mais geralmente.</p>

<p><em>"Google co-founder Larry Page's secretive Kitty Hawk project demonstrated a prototype of the company's vision for a flying car on April 24. The initial version of the all-electric Kitty Hawk Flyer is specifically designed to fly over water. It does not require the operator to have a pilot's license, at least in the United States, and the company's website describes it as an aircraft that anyone can learn to fly in minutes. A commercial version of the Flyer will become available later this year, according to Kitty Hawk. The startup, however, has not disclosed pricing for the new technology, which it says will be announced at product launch. People interested in the project can sign up for a three-year Kitty Hawk membership that costs $100. Members will receive priority placement on the waiting list for the product and be eligible for a discount of $2,000 off the retail price when it starts shipping. The $100 fee will also give members special access to Kitty Hawk's flight simulator, demonstrations and events where people will get a chance to test-fly the vehicle."</em> <a href="http://www.eweek.com/mobile/google-co-founder-larry-page-s-kitty-hawk-venture-demos-flying-car">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Representatives of China and the European Space Agency are discussing potential collaboration on a human outpost on the moon and other possible joint endeavors, according to a spokesman for the European agency and Chinese media reports. The secretary general for China's space agency, Tian Yulong, first disclosed the talks about the envisioned lunar base in Chinese state media. They were confirmed Wednesday by Pal Hvistendahl, a spokesman for the European Space Agency, or ESA. "The Chinese have a very ambitious moon program already in place," Hvistendahl said. "Space has changed since the space race of the '60s. We recognize that to explore space for peaceful purposes, we do international cooperation." The director general of the 22-member ESA, Johann-Dietrich Woerner, has described its proposed "Moon Village" as a potential international launching pad for future missions to Mars and a chance to develop space tourism or even lunar mining. China arrived relatively late to space travel but has ramped up its program since its first manned spaceflight in 2003, more than 42 years after a Soviet cosmonaut became the first to reach orbit. Last week the China National Space Administration launched an unmanned spacecraft on a mission to dock with its currently unoccupied space station. It plans to launch a mission to collect samples from the moon by the end of this year and next year conduct the first mission to the moon's far side and bring back mineral samples."</em> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-26/china-talking-with-european-space-agency-about-moon-outpost">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Pump it up? You won’t really need to, soon. Bridgestone has revealed a new “airless” bicycle tire that it plans to put on sale by 2019. The non-pneumatic features a ring of flexible composite spokes -- connected to a smaller, solid inner hub -- that both hold its shape and provide cushioning on par with an air-filled tube. A conventionally-shaped tread is mounted to the outside. Bridgestone has been developing “tweels” intended for automobiles for several years, but has yet to commercialize any of the designs. Polaris currently sells an ATV with flat-proof tires of a similar design that’s available to military and consumer users, while Michelin offers one for small commercial vehicles. Projected pricing and size availability for the Bridgestone bicycle tires have not yet been determined."</em> <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/auto/2017/04/21/bridgestone-launching-airless-bicycle-tires-in-2019.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/3032/nasa-spacecraft-dives-between-saturn-and-its-rings/">NASA Spacecraft Dives Between Saturn and Its Rings</a></h2>

<p><em>"NASA's Cassini spacecraft is back in contact with Earth after its successful first-ever dive through the narrow gap between the planet Saturn and its rings on April 26, 2017. The spacecraft is in the process of beaming back science and engineering data collected during its passage, via NASA's Deep Space Network Goldstone Complex in California's Mojave Desert. The DSN acquired Cassini's signal at 11:56 p.m. PDT on April 26, 2017 (2:56 a.m. EDT on April 27) and data began flowing at 12:01 a.m. PDT (3:01 a.m. EDT) on April 27. "In the grandest tradition of exploration, NASA's Cassini spacecraft has once again blazed a trail, showing us new wonders and demonstrating where our curiosity can take us if we dare," said Jim Green, director of the Planetary Science Division at NASA Headquarters in Washington. As it dove through the gap, Cassini came within about 1,900 miles (3,000 kilometers) of Saturn's cloud tops (where the air pressure is 1 bar -- comparable to the atmospheric pressure of Earth at sea level) and within about 200 miles (300 kilometers) of the innermost visible edge of the rings. While mission managers were confident Cassini would pass through the gap successfully, they took extra precautions with this first dive, as the region had never been explored. "No spacecraft has ever been this close to Saturn before. We could only rely on predictions, based on our experience with Saturn's other rings, of what we thought this gap between the rings and Saturn would be like," said Cassini Project Manager Earl Maize of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. "I am delighted to report that Cassini shot through the gap just as we planned and has come out the other side in excellent shape.""</em> <a href="https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/3032/nasa-spacecraft-dives-between-saturn-and-its-rings/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"When Shuaiwen Leon Song boots up Doom 3 and Half-life 2, he does so in the name of science. Song studies high performance computing at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, with the goal of making computers smaller, faster and more energy efficient. A more powerful computer, simply put, can solve greater scientific challenges. Like modeling complex chemical reactions or monitoring the electric power grid. The jump from supercomputers to video games began when Song asked if hardware called 3D stacked memory could do something it was never designed to do: help render 3D graphics. 3D rendering has advanced science with visualizations, models and even virtual reality. It's also the stuff of video games."</em> <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/news/release.aspx?id=4385">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Physicists at the Institute for Quantum Information and Matter at Caltech have discovered the first three-dimensional quantum liquid crystal—a new state of matter that may have applications in ultrafast quantum computers of the future. "We have detected the existence of a fundamentally new state of matter that can be regarded as a quantum analog of a liquid crystal," says Caltech assistant professor of physics David Hsieh, principal investigator on a new study describing the findings in the April 21 issue of Science. "There are numerous classes of such quantum liquid crystals that can, in principle, exist; therefore, our finding is likely the tip of an iceberg." Liquid crystals fall somewhere in between a liquid and a solid: they are made up of molecules that flow around freely as if they were a liquid but are all oriented in the same direction, as in a solid. Liquid crystals can be found in nature, such as in biological cell membranes. Alternatively, they can be made artificially—such as those found in the liquid crystal displays commonly used in watches, smartphones, televisions, and other items that have display screens."</em> <a href="http://www.caltech.edu/news/new-quantum-liquid-crystals-may-play-role-future-computers-54788">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2017/Q2/rechargeable-spin-battery-promising-for-spintronics-and-quantum-computing.html">Rechargeable ‘spin battery’ promising for spintronics and quantum computing</a></h2>

<p><em>"Researchers have shown how to create a rechargeable “spin battery” made out of materials called topological insulators, a step toward building new spintronic devices and quantum computers. Unlike ordinary materials that are either insulators or conductors, topological insulators are both at the same time - they are insulators inside but conduct electricity on the surface. The materials might be used for spintronic devices and quantum computers more powerful than today's technologies. Electrons can be thought of as having two spin states: up or down, and a phenomenon known as superposition allows electrons to be in both states at the same time. Such a property could be harnessed to perform calculations using the laws of quantum mechanics, making for computers much faster than conventional computers at certain tasks. The conducting electrons on the surface of topological insulators have a key property known as “spin momentum locking,” in which the direction of the motion of electrons determines the direction of its spin. This spin could be used to encode or carry information by using the down or up directions to represent 0 or 1 for spin-based information processing and computing, or spintronics."</em> <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2017/Q2/rechargeable-spin-battery-promising-for-spintronics-and-quantum-computing.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/graphene-copy-machine-cheaper-semiconductor-wafers-0419">Not stuck on silicon</a></h2>

<p><em>"In 2016, annual global semiconductor sales reached their highest-ever point, at $339 billion worldwide. In that same year, the semiconductor industry spent about $7.2 billion worldwide on wafers that serve as the substrates for microelectronics components, which can be turned into transistors, light-emitting diodes, and other electronic and photonic devices. A new technique developed by MIT engineers may vastly reduce the overall cost of wafer technology and enable devices made from more exotic, higher-performing semiconductor materials than conventional silicon. The new method, reported today in Nature, uses graphene — single-atom-thin sheets of graphite — as a sort of “copy machine” to transfer intricate crystalline patterns from an underlying semiconductor wafer to a top layer of identical material. The engineers worked out carefully controlled procedures to place single sheets of graphene onto an expensive wafer. They then grew semiconducting material over the graphene layer. They found that graphene is thin enough to appear electrically invisible, allowing the top layer to see through the graphene to the underlying crystalline wafer, imprinting its patterns without being influenced by the graphene. Graphene is also rather “slippery” and does not tend to stick to other materials easily, enabling the engineers to simply peel the top semiconducting layer from the wafer after its structures have been imprinted."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/graphene-copy-machine-cheaper-semiconductor-wafers-0419">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14948">A microprocessor based on a two-dimensional semiconductor</a></h2>

<p><em>"The advent of microcomputers in the 1970s has dramatically changed our society. Since then, microprocessors have been made almost exclusively from silicon, but the ever-increasing demand for higher integration density and speed, lower power consumption and better integrability with everyday goods has prompted the search for alternatives. Germanium and III–V compound semiconductors are being considered promising candidates for future high-performance processor generations and chips based on thin-film plastic technology or carbon nanotubes could allow for embedding electronic intelligence into arbitrary objects for the Internet-of-Things. Here, we present a 1-bit implementation of a microprocessor using a two-dimensional semiconductor—molybdenum disulfide. The device can execute user-defined programs stored in an external memory, perform logical operations and communicate with its periphery. Our 1-bit design is readily scalable to multi-bit data. The device consists of 115 transistors and constitutes the most complex circuitry so far made from a two-dimensional material."</em> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14948">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A single sheet of graphene, comprising an atom-thin lattice of carbon, may seem  rather fragile. But engineers at MIT have found that the ultrathin material is exceptionally sturdy, remaining intact under applied pressures of at least 100 bars. That’s equivalent to about 20 times the pressure produced by a typical kitchen faucet. The key to withstanding such high pressures, the researchers found, is pairing graphene with a thin underlying support substrate that is pocked with tiny holes, or pores. The smaller the substrate’s pores, the more resilient the graphene is under high pressure. Rohit Karnik, an associate professor in MIT’s Department of Mechanical Engineering, says the team’s results, reported today in the journal Nano Letters  serve as a guideline for designing tough, graphene-based membranes, particularly for applications such as desalination, in which filtration membranes must withstand high-pressure flows to efficiently remove salt from seawater."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/graphene-high-pressure-desalination-more-productive-0424">[...]</a>

<p><em>" In the not-too-distant future, it may be possible to 3-D print virtually anything. Consider standard printers, which "synthesize" thousands of colors by using only three color cartridges. By analogy, future 3-D printers may be capable of synthesizing thousands of different material properties with a mere handful of material cartridges. This concept inspired a group of researchers from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany and the French National Center for Scientific Research to explore such development of one mechanical property called effective static compressibility. As they now report in Applied Physics Letters, from AIP Publishing, by using a single cartridge it's possible to print a metamaterial which expands in size under hydrostatic pressure, even though it's made up of material which normally shrinks under hydrostatic pressure. In principle, there is no limit to the negative value this material's effective compressibility can take."</em> <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-04/aiop-gup042017.php">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Plastic, rubber, and many other useful materials are made of polymers — long chains arranged in a cross-linked network. At the molecular level, these polymer networks contain structural flaws that weaken them. Several years ago, MIT researchers were the first to measure certain types of these defects, called “loops,” which are caused when a chain in the polymer network binds to itself instead of another chain. Now, the same researchers have found a simple way to reduce the number of loops in a polymer network and thus strengthen materials made from polymers. To achieve this, the researchers simply add one of the components of the polymer network very slowly to a large quantity of the second component. Using this approach, they were able to cut the number of loops in half, in a variety of different polymer network structures. This could offer an easy way for manufacturers of industrially useful materials such as plastics or gels to strengthen their materials."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/stronger-polymers-reduce-loops-0424">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A common insect larva that eats beeswax has been found to break down chemical bonds in the plastic used for packaging and shopping bags at uniquely high speeds. Scientists say the discovery could lead to a biotechnological approach to the polyethylene waste that chokes oceans and landfills. Scientists have found that a caterpillar commercially bred for fishing bait has the ability to biodegrade polyethylene: one of the toughest and most used plastics, frequently found clogging up landfill sites in the form of plastic shopping bags. The wax worm, the larvae of the common insect Galleria mellonella, or greater wax moth, is a scourge of beehives across Europe. In the wild, the worms live as parasites in bee colonies. Wax moths lay their eggs inside hives where the worms hatch and grow on beeswax – hence the name. A chance discovery occurred when one of the scientific team, Federica Bertocchini, an amateur beekeeper, was removing the parasitic pests from the honeycombs in her hives. The worms were temporarily kept in a typical plastic shopping bag that became riddled with holes. Bertocchini, from the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), collaborated with colleagues Paolo Bombelli and Christopher Howe at the University of Cambridge’s Department of Biochemistry to conduct a timed experiment. Around a hundred wax worms were exposed to a plastic bag from a UK supermarket. Holes started to appear after just 40 minutes, and after 12 hours there was a reduction in plastic mass of 92mg from the bag. Scientists say that the degradation rate is extremely fast compared to other recent discoveries, such as bacteria reported last year to biodegrade some plastics at a rate of just 0.13mg a day. Polyethylene takes between 100 and 400 years to degrade in landfill sites."</em> <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/caterpillar-found-to-eat-shopping-bags-suggesting-biodegradable-solution-to-plastic-pollution">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Some day, your smartphone might completely conform to your wrist, and when it does, it might be covered in pure gold, thanks to researchers at Missouri S&amp;T. Writing in the March 17 issue of the journal Science, the S&amp;T researchers say they have developed a way to “grow” thin layers of gold on single crystal wafers of silicon, remove the gold foils, and use them as substrates on which to grow other electronic materials. The research team’s discovery could revolutionize wearable or “flexible” technology research, greatly improving the versatility of such electronics in the future. According to lead researcher Jay A. Switzer, the majority of research into wearable technology has been done using polymer substrates, or substrates made up of multiple crystals. “And then they put some typically organic semiconductor on there that ends up being flexible, but you lose the order that (silicon) has,” says Switzer, Donald L. Castleman/FCR Endowed Professor of Discovery in Chemistry at S&amp;T. Because the polymer substrates are made up of multiple crystals, they have what are called grain boundaries, says Switzer. These grain boundaries can greatly limit the performance of an electronic device."</em> <a href="http://news.mst.edu/2017/03/research-leads-to-a-golden-discovery-for-wearable-technology/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/3-d-printing-buildings-0426">3-D printing offers new approach to making buildings</a></h2>

<p><em>"The list of materials that can be produced by 3-D printing has grown to include not just plastics but also metal, glass, and even food. Now, MIT researchers are expanding the list further, with the design of a system that can 3-D print the basic structure of an entire building. Structures built with this system could be produced faster and less expensively than traditional construction methods allow, the researchers say. A building could also be completely customized to the needs of a particular site and the desires of its maker. Even the internal structure could be modified in new ways; different materials could be incorporated as the process goes along, and material density could be varied to provide optimum combinations of strength, insulation, or other properties. Ultimately, the researchers say, this approach could enable the design and construction of new kinds of buildings that would not be feasible with traditional building methods. The robotic system is described this week in the journal Science Robotics, in a paper by Steven Keating PhD ’16, a mechanical engineering graduate and former research affiliate in the Mediated Matter group at the MIT Media Lab; Julian Leland and Levi Cai, both research assistants in the Mediated Matter group; and Neri Oxman, group director and associate professor of media arts and sciences. The system consists of a tracked vehicle that carries a large, industrial robotic arm, which has a smaller, precision-motion robotic arm at its end. This highly controllable arm can then be used to direct any conventional (or unconventional) construction nozzle, such as those used for pouring concrete or spraying insulation material, as well as additional digital fabrication end effectors, such as a milling head."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/3-d-printing-buildings-0426">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A recent study, affiliated with UNIST has engineered a self-sustaining sensor platform to continuously monitor the surrounding environment without having an external power source. This research has been led by the team of Professor Jaehyouk Choi of Electrical and Computer Engineering at UNIST in collaboration with Professor Wonjoon Choi of Mechanical Engineering at Korea University. The findings, published in the March issue of the prestigious journal, Nano Energy note that the proposed platform is expected to contribute to advanced sensing functions of a self-sustaining system for various targeted-ambient elements. In the study the research team presented a self-sustaining water-motion-sensing (SS-WMS) platform to monitor and display the time-varying dynamics of water-motion, such as frequency and amplitude, using only the energy harvested from the water-motion itself. A self-sustaining sensor platform is a core component for Internet-of-Things (IoTs) and smart-grid systems. The existing sensor platforms require energy to operate and display the detected information. Therefore, monitoring, processing, and displaying the minute changes of a targeted-environmental element in a real-time fashion without the use of external power sources or energy storages, like batteries has been challenging. The research team solved this problem with the use of energy harvesting, an essential technology for permanent sensor platforms. Energy harvesting, also known as energy scavenging, is a technology for the harvesting of energy from various sources in the ambient environment, such as wind, water, light, heat, and mechanical energy for conversion into convebient use electric energy."</em> <a href="http://news.unist.ac.kr/new-self-sustained-multi-sensor-platform-for-environmental-monitoring/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/news/2017/04/gold-based-catalyst.page">Scientists unlock ‘golden’ secret to help boost PVC industry</a></h2>

<p><em>"A University of Southampton scientist has helped unlock the secret of a gold-based catalyst used to produce a key component of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) – the world’s third most widely used plastic. Dr Peter Wells, lecturer in Inorganic Chemistry, was part of an international group of scientists who examined the production process behind the vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) used to make PVC. PVC has become an indispensable part of modern life. Its applications include construction pipes, credit cards, window and door frames, plumbing equipment, and electrical cable insulation. China is the world’s biggest producer of VCM, making 30 million tons a year, and recently replaced the conventional production process, which used a potentially toxic mercury-containing catalyst, with a more environmentally friendly gold-based catalyst. China is the first country to produce VCM on an industrial scale using this catalyst – but until now it was not fully understood how it worked. The researchers found that the active catalyst was made up of individual atoms of gold spread out on a carbon surface. The gold also needed to be present in an ionized form – meaning that some of its electrons are missing – in order to convert acetylene, a gas derived from coal, to the VCM molecules that can then be linked to form PVC."</em> <a href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/news/2017/04/gold-based-catalyst.page">[...]</a>

But that makes the inner workings of neural networks like a black box, opaque even to the engineers who initiate the machine learning process. “If you look at the neural network, there won’t be any logical flow that a human can understand, which is very different from traditional software,” explains Guy Katz, a postdoctoral research fellow in computer science at Stanford. That opacity can be worrisome when it comes to using neural networks in safety-critical applications, like preventing aircraft collisions. Running hundreds of thousands of successful simulations isn’t enough to inspire full confidence, because even one system failure in a million can spell disaster."</em> <a href="https://engineering.stanford.edu/news/finally-peek-inside-black-box-machine-learning-systems">[...]</a>

<p><em>"For a robot to be of any real help around the home, it will need to be able to tell the difference between a coffee table and a child’s crib—a simple task that most robots can’t do today.

The data set, known as ScanNet, includes thousands of scenes with millions of annotated objects like coffee tables, couches, lamps, and TVs. Computer vision has improved dramatically in the past five years, thanks in part to the release of a much simpler 2-D data set of labeled images called ImageNet, generated by another research group at Stanford. ScanNet would contribute even more data for the mission. “ImageNet had a critical amount of annotated data, and that sparked the AI revolution,” says Matthias Neissner, a professor at the Technical University of Munich and one of the researchers behind the data set. The hope is that ScanNet will give machines a deeper understanding of the physical world, and that this could have practical applications. “The obvious scenario is a robot in your home,” Neissner says. “If you have a robot, it needs to figure out what’s going on around it.”"</em> <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/604240/a-massive-new-library-of-3-d-images-could-help-your-robot-butler-get-around-your-house/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/LoRa-IOT-Home-Environment-Monitoring-System/">LoRa IOT Home Environment Monitoring System</a></h2>

<p><em>"The LoRa IOT Home Environmental Monitoring System consists of an Arduino Mega based IOT-to-Internet gateway and Arduino Feather based remote stations with environmental sensors. The remote stations communicate wirelessly with the gateway using LoRa radios. The system enables a homeowner to monitor the home environment via an internet accessible dashboard, receive periodic SMS environmental notifications, receive realtime SMS alerts when monitored environmental parameters exceed preset thresholds, and log environmental data to the cloud. As a homeowner, other than fire, the greatest fear is water, whether it's a sudden and catastrophic pipe or fixture failure, or a slow leak that goes undetected over time. If you are away from home when a sudden and catastrophic event occurs there may not be much that can be done, however, returning home sooner rather later or calling a neighbor due to humidity readings suddenly spiking could mitigate the damage. A slow leak can be more insidious, potentially resulting in structural damage and black mold. The LoRa IOT Home Environment Monitoring System monitors household humidity levels over time and provides insight to how normal humidity levels fluctuate throughout the year with changes in outdoor humidity, and daily with normal household activities such as clothes drying, showers &amp; etc. Armed with this knowledge, high humidity thresholds can be intelligently set for the various remote stations enabling the LoRa IOT Home Environment Monitoring System to send an alert when abnormal humidity readings are detected. SMS alerts and hourly updates appear on a smart phone Lock Screen so are immediately available without requiring an application to be launched or browsing to a dashboard. The LoRa IOT Home Environment Monitoring System is built using readily available hardware modules and a few individual components such as switches and connectors. The parts for the system can be obtained from Adafruit, Digikey and Sparkfun; in many cases, Adafruit and Sparkfun parts are also available from Digikey. Competent soldering skills are needed to assemble the hardware, in particular to solder SMT uFL connectors to the LoRa radio breakout and Feather boards. The Arduino code is written in a procedural style and liberally commented to allow easy extension of functionality."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/LoRa-IOT-Home-Environment-Monitoring-System/">[...]</a>

What to do... MAKE A BUBBLE MACHINE!!!! There are many home made bubble machines out there, so I wanted to create something different using the ball screw slide. Therefore what I envisioned is an Arduino version of the old I Love Lucy candy packaging skit but as a bubble machine. So the concept was multiple bubble wand raising and lowering in a random fashion. Connected to the ball screw slide is a fan. When the wand is raised and ready for blowing, the ball screw positions the fan in front of the wand and blows the bubbles. After set time of blowing bubbles, the wand lowers to recharge with bubble solution and the ball screw slide moves to the next available ready to blow wand. I wanted this machine to be erratic in behaviour with the wands moving randomly and the ball screw slide furiously trying to keep up.

<p><em>"For the Rundbuntplasma I wanted that the main power supply (a big 20A/5V supply) could be hard disconnected (aka operating the main power switch in our hacker space) from mains and the Raspberry will still shutdown nicely automatically. The idea is to buffer the 5V for the Raspberry using two big Supercapacitors (EDLCs) with 50F each from Nesscap. The circuit was designed to be as simple as possible, the drawback is that the capacity is not used efficiently and has only enough time for a proper short shutdown (about 30 seconds). Another drawback is that the power supply comes up slowly at startup (takes about 10 seconds before Raspberry starts booting) and also powers the Raspberry for quite a long time after the shutdown so the system must be unplugged for about 10min before it will boot up again. But there main advantage over batteries is the lifetime of supercaapacitors: They can be charged and discharged completely a few 100.000 times and are quick to charge - after ~2min they carry enough charge for proper shutdown."</em> <a href="http://www.hackerspace-ffm.de/wiki/index.php?title=Raspi_EDLC_UPS">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Mountain Biking in the local trails in my Southern California home has kept me both reasonably fit while maintaining a close connection with nature. As you roll through many of the trails here, the terrain varies significantly…from the darker shadows of the canyon floors to the wide-open sun exposed ridge-top fire roads. And with these changes there are noticeable variations in the temperature and moisture in the air. So I got to thinking. Wouldn’t it be interesting to track these variations as the trail climbs up the mountain face and descends down the other side? Sure, there are gadgets available that do this kind of thing. Like tracking your position, speed, altitude and heart-rate. If you really look around, you might even find one that reports the temperature. Not cheap, but they are available. Hmmm… Let’s see, can we make a do-it-yourself alternate? A solution that is much cheaper than the cost of a commercially bought product? This looked like a perfect task for the super low-cost ESP8266 and a few inexpensive sensors. Coupled with a data link to a smartphone, you got a mobile platform tailored to track just about anything. A system that can be tailored to your exact needs. All at a fraction of the cost of a commercially available product, if you can find one meeting the specifications you want. Here is what I came up with. My initial design simply collects data samples and saves them to a file on my Android SD Card. This file is then transferred to a PC for visual representation with excel. Later, I intend to add screens to the Android App to display the data on phone. But first, a data collection and storage system was needed. After thinking about how I wanted to implement these features, the project was broken down into several phases. This post addresses phase 1. Yep, this project is “work-in-progress” and phase 1 is as far as I have gotten…so far. Check back to this blog soon for updates that cover the subsequent elements of this Application as they are developed.

Of course the biggest downside of it is that we need a server to handle this PHP script, but don't worry I will show you some free hostings. Because I like Instructable so much I decided to make live counter of instructable followers. Additionally because I always wanted to make some woodwork I decided to make like my own frame for it. In this project we will use ENC28J60 ethernet module which is very simple and great to deal with. The biggest advantage of this module is that you don't need to change any password, or username to your WI-FI, you can just plug it in and enjoy your counter. So when you change your router or password to it you don't need to worry about reprogramming your arduino. That's the perfect project for begginers not only with arduino but also with woodworking and soldering!"</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Live-Instructables-Followers-Counter/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The project Smart Mirror with home and garden automation describes the design and development of a futuristic smart mirror that represents an unobtrusive interface for the ambient home environment with automation using Raspberry Pi. The mirror provides a natural means of interaction through which the residents can control the household smart appliances and access personalized services. Emphasis is also given to ensure convenience in accessing these services with a minimum amount of user intervention. The smart mirror functionalities have been demonstrated by developing an easily extendable home automation system that facilitates the integration of household appliances and various customized information services like live custom wallpaper display. Even more, all the appliances connected to this device can easily automate with the online remote chats through telegram. This creates the mirror with more utilities using Raspberry Pi."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/team-krishna/smart-mirror-with-home-automation-using-chats-ae1dd5">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This intructable will teach you how to make very cheap Sky Control module (temperature and humidity controller). All the parts cost below 10$. The module is based on Arduino Uno. It uses a DHT22 sensor to measure temperature and humidity. The results are displayed on LCD Screen and pre-sets can be changed by using buttons. By using 2 relays you are able to connect any humidifier and heating element up to 2.5 kW. In this project devices connected to relays should have separate power source (even for 5V heating plate and humidifier that I’m using in my terrarium). In next project I will add Dust Sensor for controlling Air Pollution"</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Sky-Control-V1-Temperature-and-Humidity-Controller/">[...]</a>
