<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1823, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_Kronecker">Leopold Kronecker</a>. Este matemático alemão trabalhou para unificar a aritmética, a álgebra e a análise, com especial interesse em funções elípticas, equações algébricas, teoria dos números, teoria dos determinantes e teoria das integrais simples e múltiplas. No entanto, os tópicos que ele estudou foram restringidos pelo facto de ele acreditar na redução de todas as matemáticas em argumentos envolvendo apenas os números inteiros e um número finito de etapas. Ele acreditava que a matemática deveria lidar apenas com números finitos e com um número finito de operações. Ele foi o primeiro a duvidar do significado de provas de existência não construtivas e acreditava que os números transcendentais não existiam. A função delta Kronecker é nomeada em sua homenagem.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1905, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerard_Kuiper">Gerard Kuiper</a>. Este Astrónomo americano nascido na Holanda, descobriu Miranda, uma lua de Urano e Nereid, uma lua de Neptuno. O Kuiper Belt é chamado após a sua sugestão original de sua existência fora da órbita de Neptuno antes de ser confirmado como um cinto de pequenos corpos. Ele mediu o diâmetro de Plutão. Na atmosfera marciana, Kuiper detectou o dióxido de carbono, mas a ausência de oxigénio (1947). Na década de 1960, Kuiper foi pioneiro na observação infravermelha no ar usando uma aeronave Convair 990 e serviu como cientista-chefe para as sondas da nave Ranger da Lua. Ao analisar as fotografias da Ranger, ele identificou locais de aterragem na superfície lunar mais adequados para aterragens seguras com tripulação.</p>

<p>Completam-se hoje 45 anos que foi lançada a ultima missão Apollo - a Appolo 17. Com uma equipa de três astronautas composta pelo comandante Eugene Ceman, o piloto do modulo de comando Ronald Evans e pelo piloto do modulo lunar Harrison Schmitt foi a ultima a usar o hardware Apollo para o seu propósito original. Foi a primeira missão lançada durante a noite e a ultima a ser lançada pelo foguetão Saturno V. Com uma missão de três dias na superfície da Lua, no vale Taurus–Littrow foram recolhidos cerca de 110 Kg de amostras lunares e usados diversos instrumentos científicos para fazer medições. Foi a ultima vez que foi usado o Rover Lunar. A missão demorou um total 12 dias e cerca de 14 horas. O modulo de comando entrou na atmosfera terrestre no dia 15 de Dezembro.</p>

<p>Faz também 22 anos que a sonda espacial Galileo chegou a Jupiter.  Foi lançada em 18 de Outubro de 1989, transportado pelo Space Shuttle Atlantis, na missão STS-34. Depois de voltas de assistência gravitacional de Vénus e Terra, tornou-se a primeira nave espacial a orbitar em Júpiter. Ela lançou a primeira sonda em Jupiter, medindo directamente sua atmosfera. Apesar de sofrer grandes problemas de antenas, Galileu alcançou o primeiro vôo de asteróides, de 951 Gaspra, e descobriu a primeira lua de asteróides, Dactyl, por volta de 243 Ida. Em 1994, Galileo observou a colisão do Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 com Jupiter.</p>

<p>Esta semana ficámos a saber que, a Voyager 1, que se encontra em voo à 40 anos, a NASA voltou a ligar com sucesso os propulsores após 37 anos destes terem estado parados. A comunicação com a sonda demora cerca de 19 horas e 35 minutos a chegar à antena em Goldstone na Califórnia. Com o sucesso deste teste estima-se que a sonda possa ter mais dois ou três anos de vida. Estima-se que a sonda se encontre neste momento no espaço interestelar indo a caminho de uma estrela chamada AC + 79 que se encontra a 17,6 anos luz da Terra.</p>

<p>Tambem esta semana, um grupo de cientistas descobriram uma relíquia rara do universo: o buraco negro super-massivo mais distante. Este gigante que come matéria tem 800 milhões de vezes a massa do nosso Sol, que é surpreendentemente grande para a sua idade jovem. O buraco negro recentemente encontrado é material vorazmente devorador no centro de uma galáxia - um fenómeno chamado quasar. Este quasar é especialmente interessante porque vem de um momento em que o universo estava apenas começando a emergir de sua idade  das trevas. A descoberta fornecerá informações fundamentais sobre o universo quando era apenas 5% da idade actual.</p>

<p>Por fim, a Google afirma que o programa de inteligência artificial AlphaGo Zero triunfou no xadrez contra o software especializado mundial em poucas horas do ensino do jogo a partir do zero. A divisão DeepMind da empresa diz que jogou 100 jogos contra o Stockfish 8 e ganhou ou empatou todos eles. Os especialistas já sugerem que a conquista fortalecerá a posição da empresa num sector competitivo. "Do ponto de vista científico, é o último de uma série de deslumbrantes resultados que o DeepMind produziu", disse o professor Michael Wooldridge, da Universidade de Oxford, à BBC. "A trajetória geral em DeepMind parece ser para resolver um problema e, em seguida, demonstrar que ele realmente pode acelerar o desempenho, e isso é muito impressionante.".</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como alguns modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis. É apresentada a revista "The Official Raspberry Pi Beginner’s Book".</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2017-310">Voyager 1 Fires Up Thrusters After 37 Years</a></h2>

<p><em>"If you tried to start a car that's been sitting in a garage for decades, you might not expect the engine to respond. But a set of thrusters aboard the Voyager 1 spacecraft successfully fired up Wednesday after 37 years without use. Voyager 1, NASA's farthest and fastest spacecraft, is the only human-made object in interstellar space, the environment between the stars. The spacecraft, which has been flying for 40 years, relies on small devices called thrusters to orient itself so it can communicate with Earth. These thrusters fire in tiny pulses, or "puffs," lasting mere milliseconds, to subtly rotate the spacecraft so that its antenna points at our planet. Now, the Voyager team is able to use a set of four backup thrusters, dormant since 1980."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2017-310">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7017">Found: Most Distant Black Hole</a></h2>

<p><em>" Scientists have uncovered a rare relic from the early universe: the farthest known supermassive black hole. This matter-eating beast is 800 million times the mass of our Sun, which is astonishingly large for its young age. Researchers report the find in the journal Nature. "This black hole grew far larger than we expected in only 690 million years after the Big Bang, which challenges our theories about how black holes form," said study co-author Daniel Stern of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Astronomers combined data from NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) with ground-based surveys to identify potential distant objects to study, then followed up with Carnegie Observatories' Magellan telescopes in Chile. Carnegie astronomer Eduardo Bañados led the effort to identify candidates out of the hundreds of millions of objects WISE found that would be worthy of follow-up with Magellan."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7017">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Google says its AlphaGo Zero artificial intelligence program has triumphed at chess against world-leading specialist software within hours of teaching itself the game from scratch. The firm's DeepMind division says that it played 100 games against Stockfish 8, and won or drew all of them. The research has yet to be peer reviewed. But experts already suggest the achievement will strengthen the firm's position in a competitive sector. "From a scientific point of view, it's the latest in a series of dazzling results that DeepMind has produced," the University of Oxford's Prof Michael Wooldridge told the BBC. "The general trajectory in DeepMind seems to be to solve a problem and then demonstrate it can really ramp up performance, and that's very impressive.""</em> <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42251535">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A long-standing challenge in physics has been finding evidence for dark matter, the stuff presumed to make up a substantial chunk of the mass of the universe. Its existence seems to be responsible for the structure of the universe and the formation and evolution of galaxies. But physicists have yet to observe this mysterious material. Results reported today by a China-led space science mission provide a tantalizing hint—but not firm evidence—for dark matter. Perhaps more significantly, the first observational data produced by China’s first mission dedicated to astrophysics shows that the country is set to become a force in space science, says David Spergel, an astrophysicist at Princeton University. China is now "making significant contributions to astrophysics and space science," he says."</em> <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/11/china-s-dark-matter-space-probe-detects-tantalizing-signal">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://news.panasonic.com/global/press/data/2017/12/en171205-2/en171205-2.html">Panasonic Develops Unique Vacuum Insulated Glass Based on Its Plasma Display Panel Technology</a></h2>

<p><em>"Panasonic Corporation today announced it has developed and succeeded in mass production of thin, high-performance vacuum insulated glass by applying technologies the company accumulated in the development and manufacturing of plasma display panels (PDPs). The glass achieves a heat transfer coefficient (Ug value) of 0.7 (W/m²K)(*2), the industry's top-class(*1) insulation performance for glass with a total thickness of 6 mm, which is equal to or greater than triple glass containing argon gas(*3) with a total thickness of about 3 cm. A PDP displays an image by causing phosphors to emit light within an extremely thin vacuum layer between two sheets of glass that are vacuum-sealed. Generally, to maintain the vacuum state within the glass, vacuum sealing material technology is required to suppress emission of gas from the substances inside the vacuum layer while maintaining a high vacuum state. Panasonic has retained the vacuum glass panel manufacturing technology and lead-free vacuum maintaining material technology that it cultivated during the development and manufacture of PDPs. Now, Panasonic has realized a practical vacuum insulated glass with excellent insulation performance by developing a new slim-model gas adsorbent that adsorbs the gas that occurs within the vacuum layer, and a new low thermal conductive component that forms a 0.1 mm gap between the two sheets of glass."</em> <a href="http://news.panasonic.com/global/press/data/2017/12/en171205-2/en171205-2.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-starts-producing-first-512-gigabyte-universal-flash-storage-for-next-generation-mobile-devices">Samsung Starts Producing First 512-Gigabyte Universal Flash Storage for Next-Generation Mobile Devices</a></h2>

<p><em>"Setting a new threshold for mobile storage to handle ever-increasing amounts of multimedia content Samsung Electronics, the world leader in advanced memory technology, today announced that it has begun mass production of the industry’s first 512-gigabyte (GB) embedded Universal Flash Storage (eUFS) solution for use in next-generation mobile devices. Utilizing Samsung’s latest 64-layer 512-gigabit (Gb) V-NAND chips, the new 512GB eUFS package provides unparalleled storage capacity and outstanding performance for upcoming flagship smartphones and tablets. “The new Samsung 512GB eUFS provides the best embedded storage solution for next-generation premium smartphones by overcoming potential limitations in system performance that can occur with the use of micro SD cards, said Jaesoo Han, executive vice president of Memory Sales &amp; Marketing at Samsung Electronics. “By assuring an early, stable supply of this advanced embedded storage, Samsung is taking a big step forward in contributing to timely launches of next-generation mobile devices by mobile manufacturers around the world.”  Consisting of eight 64-layer 512Gb V-NAND chips and a controller chip, all stacked together, Samsung’s new 512GB UFS doubles the density of Samsung’s previous 48-layer V-NAND-based 256GB eUFS, in the same amount of space as the 256GB package. The eUFS’ increased storage capacity will provide a much more extensive mobile experience. For example, the new high-capacity eUFS enables a flagship smartphone to store approximately 130 4K Ultra HD (3840×2160) video clips of a 10-minute duration*, which is about a tenfold increase over a 64GB eUFS which allows storing only about 13 of the same-sized video clips."</em> <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-starts-producing-first-512-gigabyte-universal-flash-storage-for-next-generation-mobile-devices">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Imagine working in an office where, once you’ve finished one task, you had to wait until everyone in all the other cubicles completed the tasks they were working on before you could move on to your next assignment. That’s how most digital devices that rely on synchronous circuits work. Built-in clocks allow the same amount of time for the completion of each computational function. Based on a binary system of ones and zeros, it’s reliable, but it also means that the system can run only as fast as the slowest function in the chain. “In a clocked implementation, everything has to fit into a time budget, so unless you make everything faster, your chip doesn’t run faster — and ‘everything’ includes things you don’t always need,” said Rajit Manohar, the John C. Malone Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.

The electrolyte, which carries charge back and forth between the battery’s cathode and anode, is a liquid in all commercial batteries, which makes them potentially flammable, especially in lithium-ion batteries. A solid-state conductor, which has the potential to become an electrolyte, would be far more fire-resistant. Researchers at DOE’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) and Argonne National Laboratory were working on a magnesium battery, which offers higher energy density than lithium, but were stymied by the dearth of good options for a liquid electrolyte, most of which tend to be corrosive against other parts of the battery. “Magnesium is such a new technology, it doesn’t have any good liquid electrolytes,” said Gerbrand Ceder, a Berkeley Lab Senior Faculty Scientist. “We thought, why not leapfrog and make a solid-state electrolyte?” The material they came up with, magnesium scandium selenide spinel, has magnesium mobility comparable to solid-state electrolytes for lithium batteries."</em> <a href="http://newscenter.lbl.gov/2017/11/28/holy-grail-batteries-solid-state-magnesium-battery-big-step-closer/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Computer scientists are to explore how children can stay safe and retain their privacy as they engage with the ‘Internet of Things’ (IoT). Concerns about levels of computing literacy among young people, and the demands of future economies, has led to innovative programmes aimed at encouraging more children to explore and programme connected devices. Schemes to help ensure future generations of digital innovators include the creation of the BBC micro:bit, a micro controller with in-built sensors, such as compass and accelerometer, Bluetooth connectivity and pins that enable it to be connected to external sensors and other devices. The developers of the micro:bit took a very considered ethical approach to developing their device – purposefully restricting some functions, such as disabling Internet connectivity, restricting radio communication, and strengthening security around others, such as Bluetooth pairing, due to concerns around safety and privacy of children users. However, as many other current, and potentially future, devices can connect to the Internet researchers are keen to learn more about how so called IoT devices could affect the privacy and security of young people. Working alongside partners from the NSPCC, the Family Online Safety Institute, and the Micro:Bit Educational Foundation, researchers from Lancaster University, including computer scientists involved in the development of the operating software for the BBC micro:bit, will explore these issues as part of a one-year project ‘Child Proofing the Internet of Things’."</em> <a href="http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/news/articles/2017/child-proofing-the-internet-of-things/">[...]</a>

The best-known 2-D material is graphene, which is a form of carbon, but recently researchers have been investigating other 2-D materials, such as molybdenum disulfide, which have their own, distinct advantages. Producing useful electronics, however, requires integrating multiple 2-D materials in the same plane, which is a tough challenge. In 2015, researchers at King Abdullah University in Saudi Arabia developed a technique for depositing molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) next to tungsten diselenide (WSe2), with a very clean junction between the two materials. With a variation of the technique, researchers at Cornell University then found that they could induce long, straight wires of MoS2 — only a few atoms in diameter— to extend into the WSe2, while preserving the clean junction. The researchers contacted Markus Buehler, the McAfee Professor of Engineering in MIT’s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, who specializes in atomic-level models of crack propagation, to see if his group could help explain this strange phenomenon."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/nanowires-few-atoms-thick-future-electronics-solar-cells-1204">[...]</a>

Denmark’s contribution to the project is not, however, traditional brain science, but is about testing new knowledge about brain functions using a technological model and in this way contribute to verify the knowledge and theses of brain researchers . “We have developed a biologically inspired control architecture which is based on artificial intelligence, and a model of the modules in the cerebellum which is the part of the brain that controls our movements,” explains postdoc Silvia Tolu who together with Professor Henrik Hautop Lund, both from DTU Electrical Engineering, are responsible for the Danish part of the Human Brain Project. “We have used that model to control a modular robot."</em> <a href="http://www.dtu.dk/english/news/Nyhed?id=af2932ff-b15a-468f-8104-30fb380d4def">[...]</a>

<p><em>"ETH researchers have developed a biocompatible ink for 3D printing using living bacteria. This makes it possible to produce biological materials capable of breaking down toxic substances or producing high-purity cellulose for biomedical applications. There will soon be nothing that cannot be produced with 3D printing. However, the materials used for this process are still “dead matter” such as plastics or metals. A group of ETH researchers led by Professor André Studart, Head of the Laboratory for Complex Materials, has now introduced a new 3D printing platform that works using living matter. The researchers developed a bacteria-containing ink that makes it possible to print mini biochemical factories with certain properties, depending on which species of bacteria the scientists put in the ink."</em> <a href="https://www.ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2017/12/3d-printed-minifactories.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://news.berkeley.edu/2017/12/04/robots-see-into-their-future/">New robots can see into their future</a></h2>

<p><em>"UC Berkeley researchers have developed a robotic learning technology that enables robots to imagine the future of their actions so they can figure out how to manipulate objects they have never encountered before. In the future, this technology could help self-driving cars anticipate future events on the road and produce more intelligent robotic assistants in homes, but the initial prototype focuses on learning simple manual skills entirely from autonomous play. Using this technology, called visual foresight, the robots can predict what their cameras will see if they perform a particular sequence of movements. These robotic imaginations are still relatively simple for now – predictions made only several seconds into the future – but they are enough for the robot to figure out how to move objects around on a table without disturbing obstacles. Crucially, the robot can learn to perform these tasks without any help from humans or prior knowledge about physics, its environment or what the objects are. That’s because the visual imagination is learned entirely from scratch from unattended and unsupervised exploration, where the robot plays with objects on a table."</em> <a href="http://news.berkeley.edu/2017/12/04/robots-see-into-their-future/">[...]</a>

I’ve tried to be better now, checking packs every month, I’ve got some old packs for the RC car that hardly get used so I wrote down the idea to do battery storage voltage monitoring a few months ago so let’s make it happen. I’m thinking of using the nRF24L01 module (as it’s pretty low cost), using an ATtiny24/44/84 which should give us 6S support and have it powered from the first cell of the LiPo, it shouldn’t take too much current from the first cell as we stay in sleep/power down most of the time. Add in a few resistors, led, mosfets to turn on when we want to measure the voltage. I will coat the PCB in lacquer and cover it with heat shrink to protect against the environment and since the board needs to be as small as possible, I’m going to try the SMD version of the nRF24. Check-in times for these sensors might be in the range of hours as battery voltage won’t change too much, it would be nice to have a graph over say 30 days but I might look into that later if I feel it’s worth doing, for the moment it will just show the sensor number, cells, status if it’s ok or not, battery cell voltages and last check in time."</em> <a href="https://www.insidegadgets.com/2017/12/03/building-a-lipo-battery-storage-monitor-part-1-design/">[...]</a>

The laundry room in my townhouse is on the lower floor, and my hearing isn't what it used to be. So, I can't always hear the dryer alarm go off to announce the clothes are dry. Since I also don't like wrinkled clothes, I need to know the moment the dryer stops so I can hang things up. So, I paired a Arduino Yun with an accelerometer and coded the Arduino to send notification via Alexa (and Cayenne SMS) to alert when the dryer stops vibrating. A button is added for the user to start the monitor and LED to visually indicate the monitor is actively sensing vibration."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/tnunnster/alexa-your-clothes-are-dry-1bc7e7">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.deferredprocrastination.co.uk/blog/2017/uno-low-power/">How to reduce Arduino Uno power usage by 95%</a></h2>

<p><em>"Sometimes you have to use an Arduino UNO, instead of something more efficient like an Arduino Pro Mini — maybe you’re using an Arduino shield… Sometimes you have to run that same project from battery power, and every milliAmp counts… Sometimes that means that you’ll have to adjust the UNO to be much more power efficient, so you pick up a sharp scalpel, bring over the big loupe, and warm up the fine tipped soldering iron… The post formed part of development work performed for the Environment Agency. It has been re-published here with their kind permission, as part of the project commitment to open source development. The Arduino UNO is designed as a development board, instead of a specific low power device, it is built with several design choices that mean it uses more power that the minimum necessary. TL;DR To reduce the overall power usage of the Arduino UNO board significantly: replace the linear regulator with a DC-DC converter, adjust the USB-to-Serial circuit so it’s only powered from the USB port, cut out (or desolder) the always-on LED’s on the board, use the processor sleep mode. Using on-board circuit changes, selective replacement of components and the use of microcontroller sleep mode can reduce the continuous idle power usage of an Arduino UNO to only 5% of the default draw. Experimental Set Up Current measurements were made using the blink sketch that forms part of the standard Arduino Optiboot bootloader."</em> <a href="https://www.deferredprocrastination.co.uk/blog/2017/uno-low-power/">[...]</a>
