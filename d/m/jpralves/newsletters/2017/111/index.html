<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1916, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_A._Simon">Herbert A. Simon</a>. Este norte-americano ficou conhecido por ser um dos pioneiros de vários dos importantes domínios científicos actuais, incluindo a inteligência artificial, o processamento de informação, a tomada de decisão, a resolução de problemas, a teoria organizacional, os sistemas complexos e simulação computacional de descobertas científicas. Ele criou os termos racionalidade delimitada e satisfatória, e foi o primeiro a analisar a arquitectura da complexidade e de propor um mecanismo de associação preferencial para explicar as distribuições da lei do poder.
Também faz anos hoje que nascia em 1755, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Fran%C3%A7ois,_comte_de_Fourcroy">Antoine François, comte de Fourcroy</a>. Este químico francês ficou conhecido pela co-descoberta do Irídio. Juntamente com Lavoisier, Guyton de Morveau, e Claude Berthollet foi também um dos responsáveis pela estandardização da nomenclatura química actual.</p>

<p>Nas noticias da semana, a Boeing estuda a possibilidade de construir aviões comerciais de passageiros que voem sem piloto, usando a inteligência artificial que guia os controlos para tomar as decisões de voo.
investigadores da Microsoft criaram um sistema baseado em inteligência artificial que aprendeu a obter a pontuação máxima no jogo de video da década de 1980 Ms. Pac-Man, usando um método de divisão e conquista que poderá ter amplas implicações para o ensino de agentes de AI fazer tarefas complexas que aumentam as capacidades humanas. A equipa de Maluuba, uma empresa canadiana de "deep learning" adquirida pela Microsoft no início deste ano, usou um ramo da AI chamado "reinforcement learning" para jogar de forma perfeita a versão Atari 2600 do Ms. Pac-Man.
A GloabalFoundries anunciou a disponibilidade da sua tecnologia de semicondutores de 7nm - Leading-Performance (7LP) FinFET. Esta fornece um aumento de desempenho de 40 por cento para responder às necessidades de aplicações, como processadores móveis de topo, servidores em cloud e infraestruturas de rede.
Foi anunciado esta semana que o planeta Júpiter tem agora 69 luas conhecidas. O planeta Júpiter é gigante: trezentas e dezassete vezes a massa da Terra, principalmente feita de hidrogénio metálico, e no centro de um colectivo surpreendente de corpos naturais em órbita.
Foram os astrónomos Scott Sheppard, David Tholen e Chadwick Trujillo que fizeram a descoberta das duas novas luas. Estas novas luas têm cerca de 1-2 km de tamanho, e foram vistas em imagens que faziam parte de uma pesquisa para objectos muito mais distantes na Cintura de Edgeworth-Kuiper.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como alguns modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis. É apresentada também a revista newelectronics de 13 de Junho.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeing-studies-planes-without-pilots-plans-experiments-next-year/">Boeing studies planes without pilots, plans experiments next year</a></h2>

<p><em>"Boeing has begun researching the possibility of commercial-passenger jets that will fly without pilots, using artificial intelligence guiding automated controls to make decisions in flight. “The basic building blocks of the technology are clearly available,” said Mike Sinnett, former chief systems engineer on the 787 Dreamliner and now vice president at Boeing responsible for innovative future technologies, at a briefing before the Paris Air Show. “There’s going to be a transition from the requirement to have a skilled aviator operate the airplane to having a system that operates the vehicle autonomously, if we can do that with the same level of safety,” Sinnett said. “That’s a really big if,” he added. It sure is. Think about a machine that could do what US Airways Capt. Chesley Sullenberger did in New York City in 2009. When a flock of geese took out both engines on an Airbus A320 with 155 people on board as it took off out of La Guardia, Sullenberger communicated with ground controllers, rapidly sized up his limited options within two minutes and guided the plane to a safe ditching in the Hudson River. Sinnett, who plans a June 21 presentation on the subject at the Paris Air Show, agreed that the Sullenberger scenario is the standard that has to be achieved. It also underscores the challenge Boeing faces in attempting to take the human out of the flight deck."</em> <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeing-studies-planes-without-pilots-plans-experiments-next-year/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Microsoft researchers have created an artificial intelligence-based system that learned how to get the maximum score on the addictive 1980s video game Ms. Pac-Man, using a divide-and-conquer method that could have broad implications for teaching AI agents to do complex tasks that augment human capabilities. The team from Maluuba, a Canadian deep learning startup acquired by Microsoft earlier this year, used a branch of AI called reinforcement learning to play the Atari 2600 version of Ms. Pac-Man perfectly. Using that method, the team achieved the maximum score possible of 999,990. Doina Precup, an associate professor of computer science at McGill University in Montreal said that’s a significant achievement among AI researchers, who have been using various videogames to test their systems but have found Ms. Pac-Man among the most difficult to crack. But Precup said she was impressed not just with what the researchers achieved but with how they achieved it. To get the high score, the team divided the large problem of mastering Ms. Pac-Man into small pieces, which they then distributed among AI agents."</em> <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/next/2017/06/14/divide-conquer-microsoft-researchers-used-ai-master-ms-pac-man/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"GLOBALFOUNDRIES today announced the availability of its 7nm Leading-Performance (7LP) FinFET semiconductor technology, delivering a 40 percent generational performance boost to meet the needs of applications such as premium mobile processors, cloud servers and networking infrastructure. Design kits are available now, and the first customer products based on 7LP are expected to launch in the first half of 2018, with volume production ramping in the second half of 2018. In September 2016, GF announced plans to develop its own 7nm FinFET technology leveraging the company’s unmatched heritage of manufacturing high-performance chips. Thanks to additional improvements at both the transistor and process levels, the 7LP technology is exceeding initial performance targets and expected to deliver greater than 40 percent more processing power and twice the area scaling than the previous 14nm FinFET technology. The technology is now ready for customer designs at the company’s leading-edge Fab 8 facility in Saratoga County, N.Y. “Our 7nm FinFET technology development is on track and we are seeing strong customer traction, with multiple product tapeouts planned in 2018,” said Gregg Bartlett, senior vice president of the CMOS Business Unit at GF. “And, while driving to commercialize 7nm, we are actively developing next-generation technologies at 5nm and beyond to ensure our customers have access to a world-class roadmap at the leading edge.”"</em> <a href="https://www.globalfoundries.com/news-events/press-releases/globalfoundries-track-deliver-leading-performance-7nm-finfet-technology">[...]</a>

<p><em>"To which we could add: pleasanter, more accessible, more practical, more connected and so on. For over a century, this business purpose of ours has led us to bring to market innovations that improve mobility. It also compels us to constantly project ourselves into the future so that we can imagine what mobility of the future might look like! Imagine a future in which your tire is also a wheel: puncture-proof because there is no pressure. Its ruggedness comes from its biomimetic structure, as if it had been created by Nature... A wheel made of recycled materials and which is completely recycled at the end of its life, after having covered thousands and thousands of kilometers - as long as the vehicle itself. Now imagine that you don't have to worry any more about keeping your loved ones safe when you travel, because road conditions and bad weather don't matter any more: your tread instantly adjusts to your driving conditions, whenever necessary, using just the right amount of materials. A tread that can be modified and replenished at will, without wasting any resources, time or money, and which protects the environment for the generations to come... This mobility solution... Michelin has imagined it. And even a bit more than that: the prototype of the MICHELIN Visionary Concept unveiled on the Michelin stand at Movin'On in Montreal (June 13 to 15) sparked intense curiosity among experts and the international press."</em> <a href="http://www.michelin.com/eng/media-room/press-and-news/michelin-news/Innovation/MICHELIN-Visionary-Concept">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Our local gas giant has two more natural satellites added to its roster. The planet Jupiter is a beast: Three-hundred-and-seventeen times the mass of the Earth, mostly made of metallic hydrogen, and at the center of an astonishing collective of orbiting natural bodies. In fact, Jupiter's satellites form a shrunken version of a full planetary system: from the tightly bound larger Galilean moons (orbiting in their Laplacian mean-motion resonances, akin to places like TRAPPIST-1) to the remarkable array of smaller moonlets that encircle this world out to more than 30 million kilometers. These bodies circle Jupiter in anywhere from about 7 hours to an astonishing 1,000 days. Until recently the cataloged satellites totaled 67 in number. But only the innermost 15 of these orbit Jupiter in a prograde sense (in the direction of the planet's spin). The rest are retrograde, and are likely captured objects - other pieces of the solar system's solid inventory that strayed into Jupiter's gravitational grasp."</em> <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/life-unbounded/jupiter-now-has-69-moons/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The MIT AgeLab will build and analyze new deep-learning-based perception and motion planning technologies for automated vehicles in partnership with the Toyota Collaborative Safety Research Center (CSRC). The new research initiative, called CSRC Next, is part of a five-year-old ongoing relationship with Toyota. The first phase of projects with Toyota CSRC has been led by Bryan Reimer, a research scientist at MIT AgeLab, which is part of the MIT Center for Transportation and Logistics. Reimer manages a multidisciplinary team of researchers, and students focused on understanding how drivers respond to the increasing complexity of the modern operating environment. He and his team studied the demands of modern in-vehicle voice interfaces and found that they draw drivers’ eyes away from the road to a greater degree than expected, and that the demands of these interfaces need to be considered in the time course optimization of systems. Reimer’s study eventually contributed to the redesign of the instrumentation of the current Toyota Corolla and the forthcoming 2018 Toyota Camry. (Read more in the 2017 Toyota CSRC report.) Reimer and his team are also building and developing prototypes of hardware and software systems that can be integrated into cars in order to detect everything about the state of the driver and the external environment. These prototypes are designed to work both with cars with minimal levels of autonomy and with cars that are fully autonomous. Computer scientist and team member Lex Fridman is leading a group of seven computer engineers who are working on computer vision, deep learning, and planning algorithms for semi-autonomous vehicles. The application of deep learning is being used for understanding both the world around the car and human behavior inside it."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/mit-agelab-researching-autonomous-vehicle-system-in-ongoing-collaboration-with-toyota-0608">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A new MIT-designed open-source website might well be the Pinterest of microfluidics. The site, Metafluidics.org, is a free repository of designs for lab-on-a-chip devices, submitted by all sorts of inventors, including trained scientists and engineers, hobbyists, students, and amateur makers. Users can browse the site for devices ranging from simple cell sorters and fluid mixers, to more complex chips that analyze ocular fluid and synthesize gene sequences. The site also serves as a social platform for the microfluidics community: Any user can log in to submit a design; they can also like, comment on, and download design files to reproduce a featured device or improve on it. David S. Kong, director of the MIT Media Lab’s new Community Biotechnology Initiative, says the new site is designed to accelerate innovation in microfluidic design, which until now has followed a conventional, academically peer-reviewed route."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/open-source-microfluidics-0613">[...]</a>

<p><em>"At Los Alamos National Laboratory, home to more than 100 supercomputers since the dawn of the computing era, elegance and simplicity of programming are highly valued but not always achieved. In the case of a new product, dubbed “Charliecloud,” a crisp 800-line code helps supercomputer users operate in the high-performance world of Big Data without burdening computer center staff with the peculiarities of their particular software needs. “Charliecloud lets users easily run crazy new things on our supercomputers,” said lead developer Reid Priedhorsky of the High Performance Computing Division at Los Alamos. “Los Alamos has lots of supercomputing power, and we do lots of simulations that are well supported here. But we’ve found that Big Data analysis projects need to use different frameworks, which often have dependencies that differ from what we have already on the supercomputer. So, we’ve developed a lightweight ‘container’ approach that lets users package their own user defined software stack in isolation from the host operating system.”"</em> <a href="http://www.lanl.gov/discover/news-release-archive/2017/June/0607-charliecloud-simplifies-big-data.php">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.news.iastate.edu/news/2017/06/07/exciton-polaritons">Researchers image quasiparticles that could lead to faster circuits, higher bandwidths</a></h2>

<p><em>"Zhe Fei pointed to the bright and dark vertical lines running across his computer screen. This nano-image, he explained, shows the waves associated with a half-light, half-matter quasiparticle moving inside a semiconductor. “These are waves just like water waves,” said Fei, an Iowa State University assistant professor of physics and astronomy and an associate of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Ames Laboratory. “It’s like dropping a rock on the surface of water and seeing waves. But these waves are exciton-polaritons.” Exciton-polaritons are a combination of light and matter. Like all quasiparticles, they’re created within a solid and have physical properties such as energy and momentum. In this study, they were launched by shining a laser on the sharp tip of a nano-imaging system aimed at a thin flake of molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2), a layered semiconductor that supports excitons. Excitons can form when light is absorbed by a semiconductor. When excitons couple strongly with photons, they create exciton-polaritons. It’s the first time researchers have made real-space images of exciton-polaritons. Fei said past research projects have used spectroscopic studies to record exciton-polaritons as resonance peaks or dips in optical spectra. Until recent years, most studies have only observed the quasiparticles at extremely cold temperatures – down to about -450 degrees Fahrenheit. But Fei and his research group worked at room temperature with the scanning near-field optical microscope in his campus lab to take nano-optical images of the quasiparticles."</em> <a href="http://www.news.iastate.edu/news/2017/06/07/exciton-polaritons">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Some problems are so challenging to solve that even the most advanced computers need weeks, not seconds, to process them. Now a team of researchers at Georgia Institute of Technology and University of Notre Dame has created a new computing system that aims to tackle one of computing’s hardest problems in a fraction of the time. “We wanted to find a way to solve a problem without using the normal binary representations that have been the backbone of computing for decades,” said Arijit Raychowdhury, an associate professor in Georgia Tech’s School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Their new system employs a network of electronic oscillators to solve graph coloring tasks – a type of problem that tends to choke modern computers. Details of the study were published April 19 in the journal Scientific Reports.  The research was conducted with support from the National Science Foundation, the Office of Naval Research, the Semiconductor Research Corporation and the Center for Low Energy Systems Technology."</em> <a href="http://www.news.gatech.edu/2017/06/08/new-computing-system-takes-its-cues-human-brain">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers at Bielefeld University have developed a grasp system with robot hands that autonomously familiarizes itself with novel objects. The new system works without previously knowing the characteristics of objects, such as pieces of fruit or tools. It was developed as part of the large-scale research project Famula at Bielefeld University’s Cluster of Excellence Cognitive Interaction Technology (CITEC). The knowledge gained from this project could contribute to future service robots, for instance, that are able to independently adapt to working in new households. CITEC has invested approximately one million Euro in Famula. In a new “research_tv” report from Bielefeld University, the coordinators of the Famula project explain the new innovation. “Our system learns by trying out and exploring on its own – just as babies approach new objects,” says neuroinformatics Professor Dr. Helge Ritter, who heads the Famula project together with sports scientist and cognitive psychologist Professor Dr. Thomas Schack and robotics Privatdozent Dr. Sven Wachsmuth. The CITEC researchers are working on a robot with two hands that are based on human hands in terms of both shape and mobility. The robot brain for these hands has to learn how everyday objects like pieces of fruit, dishes, or stuffed animals can be distinguished on the basis of their color or shape, as well as what matters when attempting to grasp the object."</em> <a href="https://ekvv.uni-bielefeld.de/blog/uninews/entry/self_learning_robot_hands">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/new-system-allows-optical-deep-learning-0612">New system allows optical “deep learning”</a></h2>

<p><em>"“Deep learning” computer systems, based on artificial neural networks that mimic the way the brain learns from an accumulation of examples, have become a hot topic in computer science. In addition to enabling technologies such as face- and voice-recognition software, these systems could scour vast amounts of medical data to find patterns that could be useful diagnostically, or scan chemical formulas for possible new pharmaceuticals. But the computations these systems must carry out are highly complex and demanding, even for the most powerful computers. Now, a team of researchers at MIT and elsewhere has developed a new approach to such computations, using light instead of electricity, which they say could vastly improve the speed and efficiency of certain deep learning computations. Their results appear today in the journal Nature Photonics in a paper by MIT postdoc Yichen Shen, graduate student Nicholas Harris, professors Marin Soljačić and Dirk Englund, and eight others. Soljačić says that many researchers over the years have made claims about optics-based computers, but that “people dramatically over-promised, and it backfired.” While many proposed uses of such photonic computers turned out not to be practical, a light-based neural-network system developed by this team “may be applicable for deep-learning for some applications,” he says. Traditional computer architectures are not very efficient when it comes to the kinds of calculations needed for certain important neural-network tasks. Such tasks typically involve repeated multiplications of matrices, which can be very computationally intensive in conventional CPU or GPU chips."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/new-system-allows-optical-deep-learning-0612">[...]</a>

<p><em>"At the beginning of the decade, George Whitesides helped rewrite the rules of what a machine could be with the development of biologically inspired “soft robots.” Now he’s poised to rewrite them again, with help from some plastic drinking straws. Inspired by arthropod insects and spiders, Whitesides and Alex Nemiroski, a former postdoctoral fellow in Whitesides’ Harvard lab, have created a type of semi-soft robot capable of standing and walking. The team also created a robotic water strider capable of pushing itself along the liquid surface. The robots are described in a recently published paper in the journal Soft Robotics. Unlike earlier generations of soft robots, which could stand and awkwardly walk by inflating air chambers in their bodies, the new robots are designed to be far nimbler. Though real-world applications are still far off, the researchers hope the robots eventually could be used in search operations following natural disasters or in conflict zones."</em> <a href="http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/06/harvard-scientists-use-simple-materials-to-create-semi-soft-robots/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"If electric cars could recharge while driving down a highway, it would virtually eliminate concerns about their range and lower their cost, perhaps making electricity the standard fuel for vehicles. Now Stanford University scientists have overcome a major hurdle to such a future by wirelessly transmitting electricity to a nearby moving object. Their results are published in the June 15 edition of Nature. “In addition to advancing the wireless charging of vehicles and personal devices like cellphones, our new technology may untether robotics in manufacturing, which also are on the move,” said Shanhui Fan, a professor of electrical engineering and senior author of the study. “We still need to significantly increase the amount of electricity being transferred to charge electric cars, but we may not need to push the distance too much more.” The group built on existing technology developed in 2007 at MIT for transmitting electricity wirelessly over a distance of a few feet to a stationary object. In the new work, the team transmitted electricity wirelessly to a moving LED lightbulb. That demonstration only involved a 1-milliwatt charge, whereas electric cars often require tens of kilowatts to operate. The team is now working on greatly increasing the amount of electricity that can be transferred, and tweaking the system to extend the transfer distance and improve efficiency."</em> <a href="http://news.stanford.edu/2017/06/14/big-advance-wireless-charging-moving-electric-cars/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In a new study, researchers demonstrate ground-based measurements of quantum states sent by a laser aboard a satellite 38,000 kilometers above Earth. This is the first time that quantum states have been measured so carefully from so far away. “We were quite surprised by how well the quantum states survived traveling through the atmospheric turbulence to a ground station,” said Christoph Marquardt from the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light, Germany. “The paper demonstrates that technology on satellites, already space-proof against severe environmental tests, can be used to achieve quantum-limited measurements, thus making a satellite quantum communication network possible. This greatly cuts down on development time, meaning it could be possible to have such a system as soon as five years from now.” A satellite-based quantum-based encryption network would provide an extremely secure way to encrypt data sent over long distances. Developing such a system in just five years is an extremely fast timeline since most satellites require around 10 years of development. Normally, every component — from computers to screws — must be tested and approved to work in the harsh environmental conditions of space and must survive the gravitational changes experienced during the launch. Marquardt and his colleagues from the division of Gerd Leuchs at the Max Planck Institute in Erlangen report their new research in Optica, The Optical Society's journal for high impact research."</em> <a href="http://www.osa.org/en-us/about_osa/newsroom/news_releases/2017/researchers_discover_short-cut_to_satellite-based/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"It is motivated by comments from members AhmedS419 and BeenThereD where we discussed the possibility of creating a stand-alone mode without the need for commands from a USB connected PC and GUI. In this Instructable I have modified the hardware and embedded software to provide both an independent stand-alone mode of operation, requiring only external power, and a PC connected GUI mode providing additional features. The project is now enclosed an a DIY Box. Why DDS? A basic Direct-Digital-Synthesis waveform generator outputs the amplitude corresponding to phase-values based on a phase_accumulator which is incremented by a phase_step at a frequency f_clock. Compared to other Waveform Generators using the Arduino uno which directly output amplitude values based on a time-step using a timer interrupt at 100 kHz the current design permits a f_clock of ~400 kHz. Based on requiring at-least 8 sample points per waveform-cycle the effective usable output frequency would then be f_clock/8 or 50 kHz, compared to 100 kHz/8 or 12.5 kHz. Additionally the DDS methodology provides a frequency-increment/setting-resolution for a 24 bit phase_accumulator of f_clock/2^24 or 0.024 Hz."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Uno-DDS-Audio-Signal-Generator/">[...]</a>

The speaking measurement system will provides an auditory alternative to a visual meter. Our system consists of a TFT LCD to display the reading, a keypad to read user input about the mode of the system, and speakers to hear the readings of both the keypad and the measurements. Key presses on the keyboard determine if the multimeter is used a voltmeter, an ohmeter, or a capacitance meter. Additional circuitry and the functionality on the PIC32MX250F128B is used to map the voltages to ranges acceptable for the MCU and to calculate the parameter values.

<h2><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Acrylic-Gravity-Powered-Clock/">Acrylic Gravity Powered Clock</a></h2>

<p><em>"We made a gravity-powered, acrylic clock with a minute and hour hand. This is achieved by utilizing two heavy weights and a pendulum that allows the clock to “tick” once a second. The pendulum must not slow down or else the clock would stop moving, so in order to keep the clock in perpetual motion, a mechanism called an escapement is used to “nudge” the pendulum as it swings to keep it in motion. The force behind this “nudge” comes from the hanging mass, which converts its gravitational force into rotational torque that powers the escapement. The pendulum’s oscillation is then converted into rotational speed that moves a gear train at the new, precise speed created by the escapement. Once the gear achieves one rotation per sixty minutes, a rod attached to the gear’s center carries the rotation to the minute hand of the clock. Then, gears interlocking with the minute hand convert the rotational speed from one rotation every hour, to one rotation every twelve hours, giving us the correct timing for the hour hand. A cylindrical, brass sleeve is placed around the rod attached to the minute hand, which allows the hour hand to rotate independently of the minute hand, while still on the same axis. The frame of the clock is made of wood that was cut using a CNC machine, the more complex parts were 3D printed, and all of the gears were laser cut from acrylic sheets. Once all of the parts were modeled on solidworks and an assembly was made, all the parts were produced and assembled in the shop."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Acrylic-Gravity-Powered-Clock/">[...]</a>

The user has only to do is –Start the motor or if he desires it can switch off the motor by just a click only. Once the Motor pump has started- following automated condition will work: User can switch OFF the motor if he desires by a click on the web page; The motor pump will automatically get switched OFF once the soil moisture sensor has reached the required threshold value; If weather condition is such that it started raining, then the micro-controller will shut down the motor pump till raining. And after that it checks whether the soil moisture sensor has reached the threshold value or not. If it crosses the threshold value then motor pump will remain shut down otherwise it will start again automatically. This helps in saving water resource and electricity; Also in case, when power supply gets cut-off and motor gets switched off. It will restart again automatically when there will be availability power supply, user will have not to worry about restarting the motor pump manually; Also data of various sensor like- moisture sensor , temperature sensor, humidity sensor will be displayed on BOLT cloud in graphical form but due to limitation of BOLT i have only displayed one sensor data(moisture sensor data)."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/SMART-IRRIGATION-SYSTEM-Using-IoT/">[...]</a>

Either the screen was fully open but the laptop was jammed into my stomach, or I could type comfortably but the screen was half shut. I decided the best solution to this inconvenience was to build my own portable computer from scratch. I call the final product the Commute Deck. The Commute Deck is designed to provide a productive computing experience for UNIX terminal work in tight places, like the train or an economy seat on an airplane. It can be carried by hand or hooked onto a bag. It is robust enough to be jostled, and sealed so it can be carried outside in uncontrolled conditions. The mechanical keyboard is comfortable to type on (in width and layout), and the battery life is sufficient for a cross country flight or a full day at a conference. The theme of this build is to identify the problem you want to solve, then solve that problem. Seems like a tautology, but I find it’s easy to waste time solving problems that don’t really matter.

<p><em>"Fast, Portable and Affordable Oscilloscope and Inductance Meter. Don't be deceived by its small size. This little beast has an inductance meter and a oscilloscope with sampling rate of 1.7 MS/s, based on a STM32 running at 72MHz. Frequency, voltage and duty cycle information are included. As a bonus, you get temperature and pressure sensing. The main goal when I built this was to have a simple to use yet capable scope to view oscillations and an inductance meter to learn about oscillator circuits. Commercial versions of these tools have a high price that is prohibitive to many of us, so the more affordable and open source approach of this project may allow more and more makers and hackers to explore this wonderful part of electronics. Building our multiScope isn't hard from the hardware perspective, it is in the software that most magic happens. The base of this project was the STM32-O-Scope (which is also based on another scope), from which I got the DMA code. Without it, our scope wouldn't be so fast. The STM32F103C8T6 is a 32bit ARM microcontroller (with a quite long name) that has higher clock and ADC resolution than any AVR based Arduino, but is still cheaper than them. Another great thing is that you may program it using the good old Arduino IDE. I've chosen a touch screen dispay for multiScope to keep user interaction simple and flexible. With these same principles in mind, the input signal is connected to a voltage divider that can be replaced in order to reduce voltage to 3.3V, the maximum value STM32 will safely handle. Our inductance meter is based on LM339 and a simple LC circuit whose resonant frequency we measure to get the unknown L value. You may adapt multiScope to your needs. As I had a bmp180 lying around, it was included as an extra feature, but it's your choice. If you don't want it or want to include another kind of sensor, just change a few lines of code."</em> <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/20821-multiscope">[...]</a>
