<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1815, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole">George Boole</a>. Este matemático inglês ajudou a estabelecer a lógica simbólica moderna e uma álgebra de lógica, agora designada de álgebra booleana. Ao substituir operações lógicas por símbolos, Boole mostrou que as operações poderiam ser manipuladas para obter resultados logicamente consistentes. A álgebra lógica de Boole é essencialmente uma álgebra de classes, baseando-se em conceitos como complemento e união de classes. O estudo da lógica matemática ou simbólica desenvolveu-se principalmente a partir de suas ideias e a base para o desenho de circuitos de computadores digitais. As álgebras booleanas também encontram aplicações importantes em campos tão diversos como topologia, teoria das medidas, probabilidade e estatística. Boole também escreveu importantes trabalhos sobre equações diferenciais e outros ramos da matemática.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1894, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lippisch">Alexander Lippisch</a>. Este desenhador aerodinâmico germano-americano cujos projectos de aeronaves com asas em formato delta nas décadas de 1920 e 1930 foram importantes no desenvolvimento de aviões de jacto e foguete de alta velocidade. Lippisch baseou sua aeronave na forma de uma flecha neste exemplo da natureza - uma semente voadora de uma planta tropical enviada a ele por um amigo. Ele verificou que a asa perto do corpo deveria ser mais espessa para que pudesse ser utilizada para armazenamento adicional, tornando possível a asa próxima ao corpo mais longa. Foi assim que ele chegou à asa em forma de delta.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1929, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_E._Taylor">Richard E. Taylor</a>. Este físico canadiano foi pioneiro nas investigações sobre dispersão inelástica profunda de electrões em protões e neutrões ligados, que têm sido de importância essencial para o desenvolvimento do modelo quark em física de partículas. A equipa constituída por ele, Jerome Friedman e Henry Kendall realizou uma série de experiências que confirmaram a hipótese de que os protões e os neutrões são compostos de quarks. Esta descoberta foi crucial para a formulação da descrição teórica actualmente aceita da matéria e suas interacções, conhecida como modelo padrão. Em 1990 a equipa ganhou o prémio Nobel da Física pelos seus trabalhos.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1932, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvin_Schwartz">Melvin Schwartz</a>. Este físico norte-americano ficou conhecido pelas suas pesquisas sobre neutrinos (partículas subatómicas que não possuem carga eléctrica e praticamente nenhuma massa). Usando um feixe de neutrinos, a equipa descobriu um novo tipo de neutrino chamado múon e novas informações sobre a estrutura das partículas chamadas leptões. Neutrinos são produzidos quando os núcleos atómicos instáveis ou partículas subatómicas se desintegram. Schwartz e a sua equipa queriam estudar a força nuclear "fraca" que cria certos tipos de radioactividade. A equipa usou um acelerador de partículas para criar um feixe de neutrinos de alta intensidade. Estudaram as reacções produzidas quando esse feixe atingiu outras matérias. Foi-lhe atribuído em 1988 o prémio Nobel da Física conjuntamente com Leon M. Lederman e Jack Steinberger.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que a Arábia Saudita atribuiu a cidadania a um robô. Foi a primeira vez que tal aconteceu. O robô, conhecido como Sophia, apareceu no palco sem um abaya, uma cobertura de cabeça e uma capa que normalmente exigida às mulheres pelo governo saudita. "Estou muito honrada e orgulhosa por esta distinção única", disse o robô no palco. "Este é histórico para ser o primeiro robô do mundo a ser reconhecido com uma cidadania".</p>

<p>Também esta semana, o telescópio espacial NuSTAR da NASA e uma câmara rápida chamada ULTRACAM no Observatório William Herschel em La Palma, na Espanha, foram usados por cientistas para conseguir medir a distância que as partículas dos jactos viajam antes de se "ligarem" e tornarem-se fontes brilhantes de luz. Os buracos negros são famosos por serem comedores vorazes, mas eles não comem tudo o que cai na sua direcção. Uma pequena porção de material é recuperada em potentes jactos de gás quente, chamados de plasma, que podem causar estragos à sua volta. Ao longo do caminho, este plasma de alguma forma fica energizado o suficiente para irradiar fortemente a luz, formando duas colunas brilhantes ao longo do eixo de rotação do buraco negro.</p>

<p>Foi publicado um estudo esta semana que afirma que poderá haver mais planetas habitáveis do que pensávamos. Uma análise dos dados do telescópio espacial Kepler revelou 20 mundos promissores que podem ser capazes de hospedar vida. A lista de mundos potenciais inclui vários planetas que orbitam estrelas com características idênticas ao nosso Sol. Alguns tomam um tempo relativamente longo para completar uma única órbita, com o maior a demorar 395 dias da Terra e outros a demorarem semanas ou meses da Terra. A órbita mais rápida é 18 dias terrestres. Isto é muito diferente dos "anos" muito curtos que vemos em torno de estrelas menores com planetas habitáveis como Proxima Centauri.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como um modelo 3D que poderá ser útil. É apresentada também a revista newelectronics de 24 de Outubro de 2017.</p>

<h2><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/26/saudi-arabia-robot-citizen-sophia/">Saudi Arabia bestows citizenship on a robot named Sophia</a></h2>

<p><em>"Saudi Arabia just made a non-human woman a citizen, making it the first country to grant a robot the right to citizenship, at least as far as we know. Why it did so isn’t immediately evident, but the irony of a nation infamous for denying basic rights to its female citizens imbuing a robotic Audrey Hepburn lookalike with rights is not lost on us. The robot, known as Sophia, appeared onstage without an abaya, a head covering and cloak normally required of women by the Saudi government. “I am very honored and proud for this unique distinction,” the robot said onstage. “This is historical to be the first robot in the world to be recognized with a citizenship.” The revelation/PR stunt came out of the Future Investment Initiative summit being held in Riyadh. Hanson Robotics, the company that developed the robot, hails it as “the most beautiful and celebrated robot,” a claim to fame that surely ensures our non-human counterparts will be just as sexually objectified as their blood and flesh foremothers."</em> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/26/saudi-arabia-robot-citizen-sophia/">[...]</a>

<p><em>" Black holes are famous for being ravenous eaters, but they do not eat everything that falls toward them. A small portion of material gets shot back out in powerful jets of hot gas, called plasma, that can wreak havoc on their surroundings. Along the way, this plasma somehow gets energized enough to strongly radiate light, forming two bright columns along the black hole's axis of rotation. Scientists have long debated where and how this happens in the jet. Astronomers have new clues to this mystery. Using NASA's NuSTAR space telescope and a fast camera called ULTRACAM on the William Herschel Observatory in La Palma, Spain, scientists have been able to measure the distance that particles in jets travel before they "turn on" and become bright sources of light."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6986">[...]</a>

<p><em>"There could be more habitable planets out there than we thought. An analysis of data from the Kepler space telescope has revealed 20 promising worlds that might be able to host life. The list of potential worlds includes several planets that orbit stars like our sun. Some take a relatively long time to complete a single orbit, with the longest taking 395 Earth days and others taking Earth weeks or months. The fastest orbit is 18 Earth days. This is very different to the very short “years” we see around smaller stars with habitable planets like Proxima Centauri."</em> <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2151848-we-may-have-found-20-habitable-worlds-hiding-in-plain-sight/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) self-driving car unit Waymo is expanding winter testing as it works to address a potential blind spot for autonomous vehicles: snowy and icy conditions. Waymo said Thursday that Michigan is the sixth state where the self-driving car project will test autonomous vehicles. The company chose the state to see how vehicles will respond in snow, sleet, and ice. Waymo has been testing vehicles in Texas, Arizona, Washington State, Nevada and California and starts in Michigan next week on public roads with a backup safety driver sitting in the driver seat if necessary. “For human drivers, the mix of winter conditions affects how well you can see and the way your vehicle handles the road. The same is true for self-driving cars,” said Waymo chief executive John Krafcik in a blog post."</em> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-selfdriving-waymo/alphabet-looks-to-snowy-michigan-to-test-self-driving-cars-idUSKBN1CV1SN">[...]</a>

<p><em>"When NASA's Mars Pathfinder touched down in 1997, it had five cameras: two on a mast that popped up from the lander, and three on NASA's first rover, Sojourner. Since then, camera technology has taken a quantum leap. Photo sensors that were improved by the space program have become commercially ubiquitous. Cameras have shrunk in size, increased in quality and are now carried in every cellphone and laptop. That same evolution has returned to space. NASA's Mars 2020 mission will have more "eyes" than any rover before it: a grand total of 23, to create sweeping panoramas, reveal obstacles, study the atmosphere, and assist science instruments."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6987">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/software-let-your-car-tell-you-what-it-needs-1026">Let your car tell you what it needs</a></h2>

<p><em>"MIT team develops software that can tell if tires need air, spark plugs are bad, or air filter needs replacing. Imagine hopping into a ride-share car, glancing at your smartphone, and telling the driver that the car’s left front tire needs air, its air filter should be replaced next week, and its engine needs two new spark plugs. Within the next year or two, people may be able to get that kind of diagnostic information in just a few minutes, in their own cars or any car they happen to be in. They wouldn’t need to know anything about the car’s history or to connect to it in any way; the information would be derived from analyzing the car’s sounds and vibrations, as measured by the phone’s microphone and accelerometers. The MIT research behind this idea has been reported in a series of papers, most recently in the November issue of the journal Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence. The new paper’s co-authors include research scientist Joshua Siegel PhD ’16; Sanjay Sarma, the Fred Fort Flowers and Daniel Fort Flowers Professor of Mechanical Engineering and vice president of open learning at MIT; and two others."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/software-let-your-car-tell-you-what-it-needs-1026">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Meshes made from fibers with nanometer-scale diameters have a wide range of potential applications, including tissue engineering, water filtration, solar cells, and even body armor. But their commercialization has been hampered by inefficient manufacturing techniques. In the latest issue of the journal Nanotechnology, MIT researchers describe a new device for producing nanofiber meshes, which matches the production rate and power efficiency of its best-performing predecessor — but significantly reduces variation in the fibers’ diameters, an important consideration in most applications. But whereas the predecessor device, from the same MIT group, was etched into silicon through a complex process that required an airlocked “clean room,” the new device was built using a $3,500 commercial 3-D printer. The work thus points toward nanofiber manufacture that is not only more reliable but also much cheaper. The new device consists of an array of small nozzles through which a fluid containing particles of a polymer are pumped."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/3-d-printed-device-builds-better-nanofibers-1030">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A major new Australian research project using 3D implants and robotic surgery is set to radically advance the way physicians surgically treat tumours and bone cancer. The five-year project, “Just in time implants”, brings together the Australian Government, RMIT University in Melbourne, the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), St Vincent’s Hospital Melbourne and global medical technology company Stryker. Worth more than $12.1 million in research effort, the work is partially funded by Stryker with co-funding from the Innovative Manufacturing Cooperative Research Centre (IMCRC), which is contributing $2.36 million in cash. Lead researcher, RMIT’s Professor Milan Brandt, and the project team will combine 3D printing, robotic surgery and advanced manufacturing to create tailored implants for patients with bone cancer. “Our aim is to bring the technology to the theatre,” Brandt said. “While patients are having their cancer removed in the operating theatre, in the next room, we are custom printing an implant to precisely fill the space left after removal of the diseased bone.”  St Vincent’s Hospital’s Professor Peter Choong said just-in-time implants will transform the delivery of care for people with bone cancer."</em> <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/news/all-news/2017/oct/just-in-time-3d-implants-set-to-transform-tumour-surgery-">[...]</a>

The size-exclusion studies allow for a better understanding of how similar scale biological filters such as aquaporins work and so will help in the development of high-flux filters for water desalination and related technologies. For scientists interested in the behaviour of fluids and their filtration, it has been an ultimate but seemingly distant goal to controllably fabricate capillaries with dimensions approaching the size of small ions and individual water molecules.

<p><em>""Marine grade" stainless steel is valued for its performance under corrosive environments and for its high ductility -- the ability to bend without breaking under stress -- making it a preferred choice for oil pipelines, welding, kitchen utensils, chemical equipment, medical implants, engine parts and nuclear waste storage. However, conventional techniques for strengthening this class of stainless steels typically comes at the expense of ductility. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) researchers, along with collaborators at Ames National Laboratory (link is external), Georgia Tech University (link is external) and Oregon State University (link is external), have achieved a breakthrough in 3D printing one of the most common forms of marine grade stainless steel -- a low-carbon type called 316L -- that promises an unparalleled combination of high-strength and high-ductility properties for the ubiquitous alloy. The research appears online Oct. 30 in the journal Nature Materials (link is external). "In order to make all the components you're trying to print useful, you need to have this material property at least the same as those made by traditional metallurgy," said LLNL materials scientist and lead author Morris Wang. "We were able to 3D print real components in the lab with 316L stainless steel, and the material's performance was actually better than those made with the traditional approach."</em> <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/news/lab-researchers-achieve-breakthrough-3d-printed-marine-grade-stainless-steel">[...]</a>

The work has implications for controlling the shape of liquid metals. Surface tension is the force exerted by the surface of a liquid that causes it to “bead up” or form droplets. Water, for example, has a high surface tension, so it beads up, whereas alcohol, with a lower surface tension, tends to spread out. Liquid metals, such as mercury, have enormous surface tension and thus are almost always spherical.

But due to obvious reasons, it got rusted. Then I made the same project with aluminium wire, and again same thing happened. So I forgot about this project as there was no way I could get a stainless steel wire near me. But recently, an idea came to my mind, of using ultrasonic sensor for the same project of using an ultrasonic sensor for the same project. So, in this instructable I'll show you how you can make a water level indicator using an ultrasonic sensor."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Ultrasonic-Sensor-Based-Water-Level-Indicator/">[...]</a>

Intensity of these waves change depending on your internal state. The waves we will be most easily able to distinguish are alpha and beta waves -- alpha waves occur at around 8-12 Hz and when measured from the frontal lobe provide an estimate of how relaxed a person is, while beta waves are around 12-30 Hz and correspond to how much a person is concentrating or how alert they are. The concentration of each wave can also tell more specific things about your thought patterns depending on where you measure them from.

The individual LEDs have a lens built, so the light is focussed into a cone-shape. Over short distances, they give a strong reflection on the pieces of mirror glass on the glitter ball. The red, green and blue LED's are controlled by a Microchip PIC12F683 microcontroller.To make the ball rotate very slowly i used a 3V mini brushed DC motor, but i control the motor in an unusual way to get the required slow and smooth rotation : i use a digital output of the Microchip PIC12F683 to give a short burst of pulses to the DC motor about every 1,8 seconds. This short burst of pulses makes the motor step forward with a small step every 1.8 seconds.The ball is hung up from the motor using a piece of thin fishing line."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Mosaic-Glitter-Ball-With-Color-LEDs/">[...]</a>

Instead of making the steps in this Instructable in the order that I carried them out, I tried dividing it in to steps of the different elements the project contains. I hope you will enjoy my Instructable and feel free to ask me any questions you may have! "</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/SELF-SUFFICIENT-DOME/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"I was reading about this NSA hack where they use a Samsung Smart TV to record audio data in order to potentially spy on its users: https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_12353643.html I wondered on what would it take to build a similar spy microphone that could send audio over WI-FI, be cheap and small enough to hide it. What I came up is a system that uses one ESP8266(NODEMCU) board, one PIC18F25K22 micrcontroller and one MCP6024 amplifier in order to prove that this is possible. The system is pretty cheap but not very small. I built this system on a breadboard and as expected, is bulky. For a proof of concept I thinks it’s good enough. It could be made smaller by using only the ESP8266 chip instead of all the NODEMCU board, and by replacing the PIC and audio amplifier with smaller chips, maybe their SMD versions, or other smaller chips with the same capabilities."</em> <a href="http://hackingbeaver.com/?p=957">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Building a camera for 360-degree, stereoscopic 3D photos and videos. 360 photos are pretty cool, especially if you have the opportunity to view them in VR. However, stereoscopic 3D is what really brings the VR experience to life. The cheapest commerically available 360 3D camera is $800, and I'm attempting to build a camera for half that price or less. I'm using a Terasic DE10-Nano FPGA development board with a Cyclone V SoC onboard for stitching and data storage, and Omnivision OV5642 camera modules as the image input.

<p><em>"Recently Gesture controlled Laptops or computers are getting very famous. This technique is called Leap motion which enables us to control certain functions on our computer/Laptop by simply waving our hand in front of it. It is very cool and fun to do it, but these laptops are really priced very high. So in this project let us try building our own Gesture control Laptop/Computer by combining the Power of Arduino and Python. We will use two Ultrasonic sensors to determine the position of our hand and control a media player (VLC) based on the position. I have used this for demonstration, but once you have understood the project, you can do anything by just changing few lines of code and control your favorite application in your favorite way."</em> <a href="https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/control-your-computer-with-hand-gestures">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This article describes a simple routine to interface a rotary encoder to a microprocessor; I've chosen the ATtiny85 because it's the simplest processor you could use for such an application. The main routine that does all the work is just 11 lines of C, but I've also written a demonstration program that displays the encoder value on a serial 7-segment display, and the direction of rotation on an LED. Introduction Rotary encoders let you control an analogue value by rotating a knob. They generate a series of digital pulses reflecting the distance you've turned the knob, and you can also determine the direction it has been turned.
