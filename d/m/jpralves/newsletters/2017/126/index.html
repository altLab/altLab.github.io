<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1698, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Louis_Maupertuis">Pierre Louis Maupertuis</a>. Este matemático e filósofo francês ficou conhecido na história por ter inventado o princípio da menor acção também conhecido por princípio de Maupertuis - uma equação integral que determina o caminho seguido por um sistema físico.
.
Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1852, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Moissan">Henri Moissan</a>. Este químico francês ficou conhecido pelo seu trabalho no isolamento do flúor dos seus compostos. Este isolamento foi possível através da electrólise de uma solução de fluoreto de potássio em ácido fluorídrico. Foi também ele que desenvolveu o forno para produção industrial de acetileno.</p>

<p>Faz também anos que nascia, em 1860, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ulrich_Villard">Paul Ulrich Villard</a>. Este químico e físico francês foi responsável pela descoberta dos raios gama. Ele estava a estudar as radiações de sais de urânio descobertos por Henri Becquerel quatro anos antes. As partículas carregadas cujos caminhos estavam dobrados num campo magnético eram conhecidas, mas Villard encontrou uma forma de radiação penetrante que não se desviou, mas chamou pouca atenção de cientistas contemporâneos.</p>

<p>Por fim faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1925, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Cray">Seymour Cray</a>. Este engenheiro electrotécnico norte-americano foi pioneiro no uso de transístores em computadores e depois desenvolveu supercomputadores maciços para gerir redes de informações empresariais e governamentais. Ele era o proeminente criador dos grandes computadores de alta velocidade conhecidos como supercomputadores. Considerado o pai dos supercomputadores, Cray e a sua companhia lançam em 1976 o Cray-1, um supercomputador onde tudo no computador era rápido, não apenas o processador. Este foi o primeiro supercomputador a implementar o desenho de processadores vector (também designados por array processor).</p>

<p>Na semana que passou a nave espacial Osiris-Rex usou a força gravítica da Terra para se lançar no caminho do asteriode Bennu. A nave espacial esteve a cerca de 17 mil quilómetros da Antartida antes de seguir uma rota para norte por cima do oceano Pacifico. A manobra permitiu que a nave pudesse ganhar a velocidade necessária para mudar a sua orbita.</p>

<p>Após cerca de um ano de trabalhos ficou finalmente concluída uma nova ligação entre a Virginia nos Estados Unidos e Bilbau em Espanha por cabo submarino. Esta infra-estrutura designada por Marea foi subsidiada pela Microsoft e pelo Facebook e será operada pela Telxius. Com mais de 6600 quilómetros e pesando cerca de 4.65 milhões de quilos pode transmitir mais de 160 terabits de informação por segundo.</p>

<p>Também esta semana, o computador Spaceborne da HPE foi ligado a bordo da estação espacial internacional. O Spaceborne é o primeiro sistema de computador comercial de alta performance (COTS) com um teraFLOP na Estação Espacial Internacional.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como um modelo 3D que poderá ser útil. É apresentada a revista MagPI Nº62.</p>

<p>_"NASA’s asteroid sample return spacecraft successfully used Earth’s gravity on Friday to slingshot itself on a path toward the asteroid Bennu, for a rendezvous next August. At 12:52 p.m. EDT on Sept. 22, the OSIRIS-REx (Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security – Regolith Explorer) spacecraft came within 10,711 miles (17,237 km) of Antarctica, just south of Cape Horn, Chile, before following a route north over the Pacific Ocean. OSIRIS-REx launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on Sept. 8, 2016, on an Atlas V 411 rocket. Although the rocket provided the spacecraft with the all the momentum required to propel it forward to Bennu, OSIRIS-REx needed an extra boost from the Earth’s gravity to change its orbital plane. Bennu’s orbit around the Sun is tilted six degrees from Earth’s orbit, and this maneuver changed the spacecraft’s direction to put it on the path toward Bennu. As a result of the flyby, the velocity change to the spacecraft was 8,451 miles per hour (3.778 kilometers per second). <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/osiris-rex-spacecraft-slingshots-past-earth">[...]</a>

<p>_"Ford is expanding testing of Microsoft HoloLens mixed reality technology globally to gain speed in designing more stylish vehicles for its customers  New technology allows designers wearing wireless headsets to see several digital designs and parts as if these were already incorporated into a physical vehicle; this is helping Ford explore more design proposals while shaving time off design and engineering processes that can take years For example, evaluating a vehicle’s side mirror aesthetics and how that affects a driver’s view normally takes days or weeks, but can now be done in minutes, even seconds Ford designers have been swapping some clay-sculpting steels and rakes for mixed reality headsets and visualization software that can change vehicle design elements – side mirrors, grilles, vehicle interiors and more – in mere seconds. Designers have been piloting Microsoft HoloLens technology for a year now in Ford’s Dearborn studios, allowing them to see proposed virtual design elements as if these pieces were part of physical vehicles. They’ve been able to explore different shapes, sizes and textures of future vehicle attributes in minutes and hours instead of the weeks and months it can take to create clay models. And now, Ford is expanding this pioneering testing across the globe. “It’s amazing we can combine the old and the new – clay models and holograms – in a way that both saves time and allows designers to experiment and iterate quickly to dream up even more stylish, clever vehicles,” says Jim Holland, Ford vice president, vehicle component and systems engineering. “Microsoft HoloLens is a powerful tool for designers as we continue to reimagine vehicles and mobility experiences in fast-changing times.”  HoloLens technology uses mixed reality, which enables designers to see holograms in photo-quality backdrops through wire-free headsets. <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2017/09/21/ford-tests-microsoft-hololens-globally.html">[...]</a>

<p>_"Today at World Maker Faire New York, Massimo Banzi took stage to unveil two new Arduino boards, the long-range radio (LoRa)-equipped MKR WAN 1300 and the cellular-capable MKR GSM 1400. The boards come in with the smaller MKR form factor that Arduino has been utilizing of late, measuring 67.64 x 25mm. The company says they also offer low power consumption, making them useful for applications such as environmental monitoring, tracking, agriculture, energy monitoring and home automation. Both boards use the Atmel SAM D21 microcontroller, featuring a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M0+ processor, 256KB Flash memory and 32KB SRAM.The MKR GSM 1400 provides global 2G and 3G connectivity via an integrated u-blox module. The MKR WAN 1300 features a Murata LoRa module and can be powered by AA or AAA batteries or an external 5V USB, and can switch between power sources.

<p>_"Engineers at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, tested NASA's first 3-D printed rocket engine prototype part made of two different metal alloys through an innovative advanced manufacturing process. NASA has been making and evaluating durable 3-D printed rocket parts made of one metal, but the technique of 3-D printing, or additive manufacturing, with more than one metal is more difficult. “It is a technological achievement to 3-D print and test rocket components made with two different alloys,” said Preston Jones, director of the Engineering Directorate at Marshall. “This process could reduce future rocket engine costs by up to a third and manufacturing time by 50 percent.” Engineers at Marshall, led by senior engineer Robin Osborne, of ERC, Inc. of Huntsville, Alabama, supporting Marshall's Engine Components Development and Technology branch, low-pressure hot-fire tested the prototype more than 30 times during July to demonstrate the functionality of the igniter. The prototype, built by a commercial vendor, was then cut up by University of Alabama in Huntsville researchers who examined images of the bi-metallic interface through a microscope. The results showed the two metals had inter-diffused, a phenomenon that helps create a strong bond. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/news/releases/2017/nasa-tests-first-3-d-printed-rocket-engine-part-made-with-two-different-alloys.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.nec.com/en/press/201709/global_20170925_05.html">NEC device enables objects to "talk" to users</a></h2>

<p>_" NEC Corporation (NEC; TSE: 6701) today announced the development of acoustic augmented reality (AR) technology that gives a "voice" to objects that can only be heard by users of specialized wireless earphones (hearable devices). These advanced devices also enable users to easily identify the direction and location that the voices originate from, making this technology ideal for marketing purposes and guide services. The technology wirelessly provides "stereophonic sound," a realistic sound field that virtually produces a three dimensional sense of direction and distance for a sound. Moreover, "sound localization" fixes the position of a sound, regardless of the facial orientation or direction a user is moving. This is accomplished by using nine axis motion sensors mounted on a hearable device. Possible applications for this technology include the creation of promotions, as well as navigation and guidance services that are customized for individual needs, such as posters in a facility that "talk" to users directly. <a href="http://www.nec.com/en/press/201709/global_20170925_05.html">[...]</a>

<p>_"Toshiba has made a significant advance toward the realization of light, flexible solar modules that can be used in diverse locations by fabricating a perovskite solar cell mini module(Note 2) with the highest energy conversion rate yet achieved. Perovskite solar cells have a light harvesting layer formed with crystals of a compoun with a perovskite structure. Such compounds are easily and cheaply manufactured, and offer good development potential in terms of energy efficiency. The main concerns are to increase cell size and to boost the energy conservation rate. Toshiba has achieved both by developing a 5-square centimeter cell that delivers an energy conversion efficiency of 10.5%(Note 1), the highest yet realized in a multi-cell mini module. Toshiba achieved this advance by developing a fabrication process technology for film-based perovskite solar cells. <a href="http://www.toshiba.co.jp/rdc/rd/detail_e/e1709_02.html">[...]</a>

<p>_"For more than a decade, a team of researchers, engineers and developers at Microsoft has been working on quantum computing, a new model of computing that promises exponential increases in processing power and could help scientists tackle questions previously considered unanswerable—on topics ranging from climate science and medical research, to the human genome and economics. For the first time, Microsoft is releasing a new programming language and computing simulator designed specifically for quantum computing. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella made the announcement yesterday during his keynote at Microsoft Ignite, sharing how Microsoft’s team is bringing quantum computing one step closer to reality. Unlike a classical computer, in which binary digits, or “bits,” can hold only one value (a ‘1’ or a ‘0’) at a time, quantum computers are made up of quantum bits, or “qubits,” that have the potential to hold multiple values simultaneously. The challenge is in building enough qubits to reach critical mass of computational power, and in keeping them in a state of equilibrium where they’re working together and their power can be harnessed. (To learn more about the challenges and Microsoft’s unique approach to quantum computing, check out this Microsoft article and coverage of yesterday’s announcement in WIRED and Ars Technica.) <a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/quantum/2017/09/26/microsoft-announces-quantum-computing-programming-language/">[...]</a>

Possible applications could include supporting rescue teams with search missions at dusk or dawn. To fly safely, drones need to know their precise position and orientation in space at all times. While commercial drones solve this problem using GPS, this only works outdoors, and is not very reliable, especially in urban environments. Furthermore, the conventional cameras mounted on drones work only when there is a high amount of light available, and the drone’s speed has to be limited otherwise the resulting image is motion-blurred and cannot be used by computer vision algorithms.

<p>_"The latest versions of most smartphones contain at least two and sometimes three built-in cameras. Researchers at the University of Illinois would like to sell mobile device manufactures on the idea of adding yet another image sensor as a built-in capability for health diagnostic, environmental monitoring, and general-purpose color sensing applications. Three years ago, the National Science Foundation provided a pair of University of Illinois professors with a grant to develop technology called “Lab-in-a-Smartphone.” Over that time, the research teams of Brian Cunningham, Donald Biggar Willett Professor of Engineering, and John Dallesasse, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering, have published papers detailing potential ways the mobile devices could provide health diagnostic tests and other measurements normally performed in a laboratory setting. Their latest efforts demonstrate that mobile devices incorporating their sensor can provide accurate measurements of optical absorption spectra of colored liquids or the optically scattered spectra of solid objects. In other words, a mobile device incorporating the lab-in-a-smartphone “science camera” could accurately read liquid-based or paper-based medical tests in which the end result is a material that changes from one color to another in the presence of a specific analyte. The team successfully demonstrated a very compact inexpensive system that performs optical spectroscopy in a form factor that can fit inside the body of a phone. <a href="http://engineering.illinois.edu/news/article/23587">[...]</a>

Electronic circuitry is traditionally constructed from three primary elements; a resistor, a capacitor and an inductor. A sinusoidal electrical signal passing through these devices will change in signal strength, or amplitude, and the relative timing of the crest of the wave, known as its phase. A resistor will change amplitude only while a capacitor and an inductor can also change phase, but only by exactly one quarter of the length of the wave, or 90°.

<p><em>"We have developed a Vacuum-powered Soft Pneumatic Actuator (V-SPA) which leverages a single, shared vacuum power supply and enables complex soft robotic systems with multiple-DoF and diverse functions. In addition to actuation, other utilities enabled by vacuum pressure include gripping and stiffening through granular media jamming, as well as direct suction adhesion to smooth surfaces, for manipulation or vertical fixation. We investigated the performance of the new actuator through direct characterization of a 3-DoF, plug-and-play V-SPA Module built from multiple V-SPAs, and demonstrate the integration of different vacuum-enabled capabilities with a continuum-style robot platform outfitted with modular peripheral mechanisms. We show these different vacuum-powered modules can be combined to achieve a variety of tasks, including multi-modal locomotion, object manipulation, and stiffness tuning to illustrate the utility and viability of vacuum as a singular alternative power source for soft pneumatic robots, and not just a peripheral feature in itself. Our results highlight the effectiveness of V-SPAs in providing core soft robot capabilities and facilitating the consolidation of previously disparate subsystems for actuation and various specialized tasks, conducive to improving the compact design efficiency of larger, more complex multi-functional soft robotic systems.

<p>_"Researchers at the Universities of Vienna and Göttingen have succeeded in developing a method for predicting molecular infrared spectra based on artificial intelligence. These chemical "fingerprints" could only be simulated by common prediction techniques for small molecules in high quality. With the help of the new technology, which is based on neuronal networks similar to the human brain and is therefore capable of learning, the team led by Philipp Marquetand from the Faculty of Chemistry at the University of Vienna was able to carry out simulations that were previously not possible. The potential of this new strategy has now been published in the current issue of the journal "Chemical Science". Drastic advances in research of artificial intelligence have led to a wide range of fascinating developments in this area over the last decade. Autonomously driven cars, but also everyday applications such as search engines and spam filters illustrate the versatility of methods from the field of artificial intelligence. <a href="http://medienportal.univie.ac.at/presse/aktuelle-pressemeldungen/detailansicht/artikel/mit-kuenstlicher-intelligenz-zum-chemischen-fingerabdruck/">[...]</a>

<p>_" The potential for photon entanglement in quantum computing and communications has been known for decades. One of the issues impeding its immediate application is the fact that many photon entanglement platforms do not operate within the range used by most forms of telecommunication. An international team of researchers has started to unravel the mysteries of entangled photons, demonstrating a new nanoscale technique that uses semiconductor quantum dots to bend photons to the wavelengths used by today’s popular C-band standards. They report their work this week in Applied Physics Letters, from AIP Publishing. “We have demonstrated the emission of polarization-entangled photons from a quantum dot at 1550 nanometers for the first time ever,” said Simone Luca Portalupi, one of the work's authors and a senior scientist at the Institute of Semiconductor Optics and Functional Interfaces at the University of Stuttgart. “We are now on the wavelength that can actually carry quantum communication over long distances with existing telecommunication technology.”  The researchers used quantum dots created from an indium arsenide and gallium arsenide platform, producing pure single photons and entangled photons. <a href="https://publishing.aip.org/publishing/journal-highlights/quantum-communications-bend-our-needs">[...]</a>

<p>_"In the race to replace silicon in low-cost solar cells, semiconductors known as metal halide perovskites are favored because they can be solution-processed into thin films with excellent photovoltaic efficiency. A collaboration between KAUST and Oxford University researchers has now uncovered a strategy that grows perovskites into centimeter-scale, highly pure crystals thanks to the effect of surface tension. In their natural state, perovskites have difficultly moving solar-generated electricity because they crystallize with randomly oriented grains. Osman Bakr from KAUST’s Solar Center and coworkers are working on ways to dramatically speed up the flow of these charge carriers using inverse temperature crystallization (ITC). This technique uses special organic liquids and thermal energy to force perovskites to solidify into structures resembling single crystals—the optimal arrangements for device purposes. While ITC produces high-quality perovskites far faster than conventional chemical methods, the curious mechanisms that initiate crystallization in hot organic liquids are poorly understood. <a href="https://discovery.kaust.edu.sa/en/article/423/a-little-tension-yields-enormous-solar-crystals">[...]</a>

<p>_"From butterflies that sprout wings to hermit crabs that switch their shells, many animals must adapt their exterior features in order to survive. While humans don’t undergo that kind of metamorphosis, we often try to create functional objects that are similarly adaptive — including our robots. Despite what you might have seen in “Transformers” movies, though, today’s robots are still pretty inflexible. Each of their parts usually has a fixed structure and a single defined purpose, making it difficult for them to perform a wide variety of actions. Researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) are aiming to change that with a new shape-shifting robot that’s something of a superhero: It can transform itself with different “outfits” that allow it to perform different tasks. Dubbed “Primer,” the cube-shaped robot can be controlled via magnets to make it walk, roll, sail, and glide. <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/superhero-robot-wears-different-outfits-different-tasks-0927">[...]</a>

<p>_"A Case Western Reserve University researcher has turned the origami she enjoyed as a child into a patent-pending soft robot that may one day be used on an assembly line, in surgery or even outer space. Kiju Lee, the Nord Distinguished Assistant Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, and her lab have moved from paper robots to 3-D-printed models that bend, contract, extend and twist. This novel mechanism is called TWISTER (TWISted TowEr Robot). TWISTER was inspired by an origami twisted tower originally designed by Japanese artist Mihoko Tachibana, which uses multiple origami segments to form a tower structure. This origami design was then reinvented for various potential applications in robotics and manufacturing. In her earlier work using paper-folded structures, Lee’s team added three small versions of the towers to one end of the larger tower and manipulated them to grasp like three opposing fingers. <a href="http://thedaily.case.edu/case-western-reserve-university-researchers-design-soft-flexible-origami-inspired-robot/">[...]</a>

<p>_"Particle collision experiments at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider (LHC)—the world’s largest particle accelerator—will generate around 50 petabytes (50 million gigabytes) of data this year that must be processed and analyzed to aid in the facility’s search for new physics discoveries. That already-massive amount of data is expected to grow significantly when CERN transitions to the High-Luminosity LHC, a facility upgrade being carried out now for operations planned in 2026. “With the High-Luminosity LHC, we’re expecting 20 times the data that are produced by today’s LHC runs,” said Taylor Childers, a physicist at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory and a member of the ATLAS experiment, one of the four particle detectors at the LHC. “Based on our best estimates, we’ll need about a factor of 10 increase in computing resources to handle the increased amount of data.” Childers is part of a team exploring the use of supercomputers at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF), a DOE Office of Science User Facility, to help meet the LHC’s growing computing demands. His collaborators include Argonne physicist Thomas LeCompte, ALCF computer scientist Tom Uram, and Duke University researcher Doug Benjamin.

<p>_"Researchers from Finland and Taiwan have discovered how graphene, a single-atom-thin layer of carbon, can be forged into three-dimensional objects by using laser light. A striking illustration was provided when the researchers fabricated a pyramid with a height of 60 nm, which is about 200 times larger than the thickness of a graphene sheet. The pyramid was so small that it would easily fit on a single strand of hair. The research was supported by the Academy of Finland and the Ministry of Science and Technology of the Republic of China. Graphene is a close relative to graphite, which consists of millions of layers of graphene and can be found in common pencil tips. After graphene was first isolated in 2004, researchers have learned to routinely produce and handle it. <a href="http://www.aka.fi/en/about-us/media/press-releases/2017/graphene-forged-into-three-dimensional-shapes/">[...]</a>

That could be tedious cleaning employee that do the room checking just needed 3 parameter to be checked: Does the Air Conditioner Turned On or Off Does the Light Turned On or Off Is the room temperature and humidity fit enough for people to get comfortable The building has 24/7 Wifi that has the same SSID and connected to internet, which got me thinking to make a device to make the cleaning employee's job lighter, so they can monitor every room anytime with any device and they only come to the room to turned on/off the AC and light.The building already has its own cable system with 4 available wall plug and to make a new device embedded on the wall could cost much more money, so the approach for making this device is this device needs to be portable could be plug directly to a wall socket or can run on its own power for a long period of time.

Well, there area number of different solutions for this problem, such as radar, sonar(sometimes SODAR in air), bump switches, and one of the most widely usedsolutions, Infrared obstacle detection. This type of sensor is called aproximity sensor, because it can only detect if an obstacle is withinor without a set range.

It is a nice design around an Arduino Uno, with a RF remote built around a WII nunchuch controller. They built it into a wooden case, but the 3D printing addict in me cried out for a printed case so I hit Sketchup and did a case with a head, and a remote case for the controller.

Fans can be controlled manually with a simple on/off switch and we can also automate their use. In this project, we build an automated fan that is controlled by a user temperature setting, a user humidity setting, or both.

Also, you get to have much more advanced projects since you won't run out of memory (as you would with micropython) and you can write just about any code you want (with MakeCode you are more constrained to what has already been provided for you, a trade-off for ease-of-use). <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/use-micro-bit-with-arduino?view=all">[...]</a>

They have some other open source guitar pedals as well, based on Arduino boards but this is their first step into the magical world of Raspberry Pi. They have their own packaged ISO of Raspbian Jessie Lite that includes their self-written effects scripts so that you can change effects via the terminal, since the Lite distro does not have a GUI (of course you can use a version of Raspbian w/ a GUI if that's more your style, but personally for this application I think sans-GUI is the way to go).
