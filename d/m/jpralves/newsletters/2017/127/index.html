<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1781, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Bolzano">Bernard Bolzano</a>. Este Matemático e teólogo checo que fez contribuições significativas tanto para a matemática como para a teoria do conhecimento. Ele forneceu uma prova mais detalhada para o teorema binomial em 1816 e sugeriu os meios de distinguir entre classes finitas e infinitas. Bolzano ajudou a estabelecer as bases da análise (por exemplo, o teorema de Bolzano-Weierstrass), tentou elaborar o método matemático e antecipou algumas idéias básicas da teoria dos conjuntos de Cantor.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1864, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_and_Louis_Lumi%C3%A8re">Louis Lumière</a>. Este inventor francês, trabalhou com seu irmão Auguste, para criar equipamentos pioneiros de filmagem. Louis inventou o projector e a câmara de duas funções "Cinématographe" de 25 lb, que melhoraram o Kinetoscope de Thomas Edison, adicionando um mecanismo de movimento de filme intermitente (baseado na máquina de costura). A 13 de Fevereiro de 1895, eles patentearam em conjunto o dispositivo (como era costume). Foi demonstrado pela primeira vez a uma audiência convocada em 22 de Março de 1895, mostrando seu primeiro filme para um público convidado que viu "La Sortie des ouvriers de l'usine Lumière" mostrando trabalhadores que saem da fábrica de Lumière. A primeira exibição pública de sucesso em 28 de Dezembro de 1895 de seus filmes em Paris foi o "nascimento" do cinema.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1882, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_H._Goddard">Robert H. Goddard</a>. Este físico e engenheiro de foguetes, e inventor  norte-americano ficou conhecido como o "pai do foguetão moderno". Desde os 17 anos, Goddard estava interessado em foguetes (1899) e, em 1908, realizou testes estáticos com pequenos foguetes de combustível sólido. Ele desenvolveu a teoria matemática da propulsão do foguete (1912) e provou que os foguetes funcionariam no vácuo para o vôo espacial (1915). Durante a Primeira Guerra Mundial, Goddard desenvolveu armas de foguete. Ele escreveu um Método de Alcance de Altitudes Extremas, em 1919. Durante as duas décadas seguintes, ele produziu uma série de grandes foguetes de combustível líquido na sua fábrica de foguetes em Roswell. Durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial, ele desenvolveu a descolagem assistida por foguetes de aviões de transporte da Marinha e motores de foguete de combustível de propulsão variável. Quando morreu, Goddard tinha 214 patentes em foguetões.</p>

<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1889, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Coster">Dirk Coster</a>. Este físico holandês que (trabalhando com Georg von Hevesy) descobriu o elemento háfnio aplicando habilmente o método de análise de raios X de Henry Moseley para distinguir as linhas espectrais do háfnio, apesar da distracção de algumas linhas estranhas. Niels Bohr sugeriu que eles observassem de perto um minério de zircónio, um homólogo, para o novo elemento. Bohr ouviu por telefone seu sucesso no dia da sua conferência do Prémio Nobel (11 de dezembro de 1922), em que ele anunciou sua descoberta. O elemento, no.72, foi nomeado para Hafnia, o antigo nome romano para Copenhaga. Anteriormente, trabalhando no laboratório de Bohr em Copenhaga, Coster usou raios-X para fornecer dados experimentais para apoiar a teoria da estrutura atómica de Bohr e a tabela periódica.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1930, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinhard_Selten">Reinhard Selten</a>. Este Matemático alemão que partilhou o Prémio Nobel de Economia de 1994 com John F. Nash e John C. Harsanyi pelo desenvolvimento da teoria dos jogos, um ramo de matemática que examina rivalidades entre concorrentes com interesses mistos. Selten conseguiu um avanço decisivo na teoria dos jogos: a introdução dos conceitos de equação subjuntiva perfeita e perfeita reduziu o conjunto da Equillibria de Nash drasticamente excluindo ameaças que não são credíveis. Assim, podem ser feitas previsões mais precisas e sensíveis para muitos jogos, e. mercados. Além disso, a teoria do jogo encontrou aplicações em todas as ciências sociais e até mesmo em biologia.</p>

<p>Na semana que passou a SpaceX anunciou a intenção de substituir o Falcon 9 e Falcon Heavy e o Dragon por uma nova nave espacial. O plano é, em parte, ter um veículo menor do que o originalmente planeado para uso em missões de Marte, que é "ainda muito grande", mas também é prático para uso para "tudo o que é necessário para uma maior actividade em órbita terrestre".</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou Elon Musk que há muito sonha em criar uma colónia humana em Marte, está a planear construir uma nova nave designada por  "BFR" capaz de viajar até qualquer lugar da Terra em menos de uma hora. Se o conceito se tornar realidade, Musk disse que uma viagem de Nova York a Xangai pode ser feita em cerca de 30 minutos. O anúncio de surpresa significa que a sua Space Exploration Technologies Corp., que já abanou a indústria aeroespacial com lançamentos reutilizáveis, planeia transportar seres humanos não apenas para planetas distantes, mas também sobre este, criando um desafio potencialmente competitivo para a indústria aérea comercial.</p>

<p>E fez ontem 60 anos que foi lançado o famoso satélite Sputnik-1. Com um diâmetro de 58 centímetros e um peso de cerca de 84 Kg este foi o primeiro satélite artificial da Terra. Equipado com 4 antenas de rádio era capaz de emitir sinais de rádio. O satélite viajava a cerca de 2 mil quilómetros por hora e completava uma orbita à terra em cerca de 96.2 minutos. Transmitiu sinais durante 21 dias. Foi destruído na reentrada na atmosfera da Terra a 4 de Janeiro de 1958, depois de viajar cerca de 70 milhões de quilómetros em 1440 orbitas a volta da Terra.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como vários modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis. É apresentada a revista newelectronics de 26 de Setembro.

<p><em>"When Elon Musk took the stage at the International Astronautical Congress today to expand on the Mars plan he revealed at the event last year, he started where people had the most questions last time around: How will you pay for trips to Mars? The answer, Musk said, had a lot to do with simplifying the companies lineup, and rendering redundant some of its current products. To do that, it’ll try to replace all of its current launch vehicles, including Falcon 9, and the larger Falcon Heavy it hopes to launch this year, along with its Dragon transportation capsule with one ship, and one booster. “I think we have figured out how to pay for it – this is very important,” Musk said, to chuckles from the crowd. The plan is in part to have a smaller vehicle than was originally planned for use in Mars missions, which is “still pretty big,” but it’s also practical for use for “everything that’s needed in greater Earth orbit activity,” Musk said. “Essentially we want to make our current vhielces redundant,” he added."</em> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/28/spacex-aims-to-replace-falcon-9-falcon-heavy-and-dragon-with-one-spaceship/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Entrepreneur Elon Musk, who has long dreamed of creating a human colony on Mars, is planning to build a new rocket ship code named “BFR” capable of traveling anywhere on Earth in under an hour. If the concept becomes reality, Musk said a journey from New York to Shanghai can be done in about 30 minutes. The surprise announcement means that his Space Exploration Technologies Corp., which has already disrupted the aerospace industry with reusable launches, plans to ferry humans not just to distant planets but across this one as well, setting up a potentially competitive challenge to the commercial airline industry. “If we are going to places like Mars, why not Earth?” Musk said Friday at the 68th International Astronautical Congress in Adelaide, Australia. Toward the end of Musk’s highly technical presentation, animation played on a big screen behind him, showing scores of people getting on a high-speed ferry in New York, then boarding the BFR on a platform in the water. The spaceship then travels to Shanghai in roughly half an hour."</em> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-29/elon-musk-s-new-vision-anywhere-on-earth-in-under-one-hour">[...]</a>

<p><em>"It was 8:07 p.m. on a Friday night in Riverhead, Long Island, when the operators at an RCA Communications outpost picked up a signal that had never been heard before on Earth. A sharp, insistent beep sang out over short-wave radios, filling up our ears with the knowledge that humans had succeeded in sending something outside our protective blanket of nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide. Within hours of the announcement, diligent searchers of the skies—all volunteer amateur astronomers who had trained for this moment—assembled, and confirmed with their eyes what our ears already knew. In Terre Haute, Indiana; Whittaker, California; and Columbus, Ohio, these stargazers tracked a faintly shining object as it sped around Earth at 18,000 miles per hour, heading from west to east across the darkened sky. The appearance of a second, 184 pound moon in the skies above America shocked the nation, not in the least because our new moonlet had been sent there by the rival Soviets. Newspaper reports at the time asked the man who oversaw America’s yet-to-launch satellite program, Rear Admiral Rawson Bennett, for a reaction to Sputnik’s launch."</em> <a href="https://www.popsci.com/sputnik-shocked-world-and-started-space-race">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Keeping its vessels in top condition is a critical aspect of a naval force’s readiness, but to do so each part, little or big, needs full attention. Claire Apthorp looks at a project to scan the entire Dutch Navy in 3D. The Royal Netherlands Navy contracts work for the maintenance of its vessels and submarines to Dutch organisation Marinebedrijf Koninklijke Marine. In addition to maintaining the vessels, Marinebedrijf Koninklijke Marine is responsible for creating new parts for the ships to replace damaged parts, and carrying out modifications to on-board components when required, from everything to the hull to weapons systems and engines. In order to speed up its servicing, Marinebedrijf Koninklijke Marine turned to Artec 3D, a company that produces 3D scanners that allow maintenance personnel to reverse engineer parts for vessels that need to be replaced, for which the drawings or 3D CAD files are not accessible. The Artec Eva and Spider 3D handheld scanners used for this project are structured light scanners."</em> <a href="http://www.naval-technology.com/features/featurescanning-the-dutch-navy-5920931/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In case you haven’t noticed, our team has just released Arduino IDE 1.8.5! This time the changelog is fairly small, as it mainly solves a (rather important) problem being encountered by macOS users who just updated to High Sierra (10.13). If you are not using English as system language, any version of Arduino you launch will lack the menu in the system bar. Every Java application is experiencing the same problem, so it will probably be solved by Apple in the near future. In the meantime, IDE 1.8.5 recognizes when the menu bar is not being displayed and replaces it with a Windows-style one. It may not be the prettiest thing, but at least it works!"</em> <a href="https://blog.arduino.cc/2017/10/02/arduino-ide-1-8-5-hotfix-for-macos-high-sierra-users/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3018476/tsmc-is-building-worlds-first-3nm-fab-in-taiwan">TSMC is building 'world's first' 3nm fab in Taiwan</a></h2>

<p><em>"TAIWAN SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING CO (TSMC) Taiwan is building the 'world's first' semiconductor plant that will be able to support the creation of 3nm node silicon chips. While the company has been talking about building the 3nm fab for a while, recent rumours seemed to give the impression that fab would be built in the US, after President Donald Trump's claims that more digital manufacturing was welcome in the country. However, TSMC has made it clear, according to DigiTimes, that it'll be staying in Taiwan at the Tainan Science Park to "fully leverage the company's existing cluster advantage" and see the benefit of a "comprehensive supply chain". The firm already operates a 5nm fab in the same location, so it's not an illogical leap, though TSMC hasn't started producing 5nm chips yet. Its website saying that these are "scheduled to start risk production in the second quarter of 2019". IBM, meanwhile, has successfully created 5nm silicon chips already, having revealed back in June that it had used silicon nanosheets in a "Gate All Around" field-effect transistor (GAAFET) setup."</em> <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3018476/tsmc-is-building-worlds-first-3nm-fab-in-taiwan">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Dear Arduino Community, Back in July, we announced that the original Arduino founders regained full control of Arduino as a company. It was the culmination of a project that lasted several months, which required a tremendous amount of effort in finding the right partner that could help us make it happen while keeping the spirit of Arduino true to itself. Throughout the litigation we dreamed of reclaiming control of the company, bringing it back to its original principles while designing a strategy that would allow us to tackle the challenges of the contemporary IoT world. In order to make this a reality, we needed a partner that would provide us with the resources to regain full ownership of Arduino as a company while keeping it independent and true to its values of openness. It wasn’t easy, but more than a year ago, in the middle of the litigation, we started a conversation with an important technology company that is an essential building block of today’s digital world: Arm. During a very hot day in spring I visited California to meet with Arm."</em> <a href="https://blog.arduino.cc/2017/10/05/arduino-announces-arm-partnership/">[...]</a>

This far the search has been to no avail A team of scientists from Center for Quantum Devices at Niels Bohr Institute (NBI) and from Purdue University, USA, have – however – recently contributed to the advancement of Majorana research.

<p><em>"DARPA’s Video Synthetic Aperture Radar (ViSAR) program recently completed flight tests, successfully demonstrating a new sensor that can capture real-time video through clouds. The ViSAR program, which began in 2013, has been developing an Extremely High Frequency (EHF) targeting sensor to operate through clouds as effectively as current electro-optical and infrared (EO/IR) sensors operate in clear weather. The program’s goal is to develop a cloud-penetrating EHF sensor in a moveable gimbal that could be mounted on a variety of aerial platforms to provide high-resolution, full-motion video for engaging moving ground targets in all weather conditions—cloudy or clear. “The recent flight tests of the ViSAR sensor marked a major program milestone toward our goal, proving that we can take uninterrupted live video of targets on the ground even when flying through or above clouds,” said Bruce Wallace, program manager in DARPA’s Strategic Technology Office. “The EO/IR sensors on board the test aircraft went blank whenever clouds obscured the view, but the synthetic aperture radar tracked ground objects continuously throughout the flight.” Wallace noted that cloud-penetrating radar—such as from space or other operational systems—has existed in other formats, but there has not been a synthetic aperture sensor, which can fit in a standard EO/IR sensor gimbal on aircraft and maintain frame rates fast enough to track maneuvering targets on the ground. The recent ViSAR tests took place on a modified DC-3 aircraft that flew at low and medium altitudes, allowing researchers to collect and compare data from the ViSAR, EO, and IR sensors mounted on standard sensor gimbals."</em> <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2017-09-28">[...]</a>

With current end-to-end encryption, if an attacker compromises a recipient’s device, they can then put themselves in a position to intercept, read and alter all future communications without sender or recipient ever knowing. The new protocol, published in IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, forces attackers to leave evidence of any such activity and alerts users to take action. Dr. Jiangshan Yu at the University of Luxembourg, Professor Mark Ryan at the University of Birmingham and Professor Cas Cremers at the University of Oxford, were motivated by the discovery of mass software vulnerabilities, such as the Heartbleed bug, that make the majority of devices vulnerable to compromise. Dr Yu explained, “There are excellent end-to-end encryption services out there, but by definition they rely on your device itself remaining secure; once a device has been compromised there’s little we can do.

Nevertheless, they identified several "significant" effects (at least statistically) that they in turn characterized as "small" or "modest," implying other factors may be more important. "By triangulating findings from different methods, and controlling for confounding effects such as team size, project size, and project history, we report that language design does have a significant, but modest effect on software quality," the paper states."</em> <a href="https://adtmag.com/articles/2017/10/03/acm-code-quality.aspx">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers from the University of Bristol have discovered that super-powerful quantum computers, which scientists and engineers across the world are racing to build, need to be even more powerful than previously thought before they can beat today’s ordinary PCs. Quantum computers are a new type of machine that operate on quantum mechanical hardware and are predicted to give enormous speed advantages in solving certain problems. Research groups at leading universities and companies, including Google, Microsoft and IBM, are part of a worldwide race to realise the first quantum computer that crosses into the ‘quantum computational singularity’. This represents a problem so complex that today’s top supercomputer would take centuries to find a solution, while a quantum computer could crack it in minutes. Now a team of scientists from Bristol have discovered that the boundary to this singularity is further away than previously thought. The research is reported this week in Nature Physics."</em> <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2017/october/singularity-for-quantum-computers.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"New research has shown that an exotic kind of magnetic behavior discovered just a few years ago holds great promise as a way of storing data — one that could overcome fundamental limits that might otherwise be signaling the end of “Moore’s Law,” which describes the ongoing improvements in computation and data storage over recent decades. Rather than reading and writing data one bit at a time by changing the orientation of magnetized particles on a surface, as today’s magnetic disks do, the new system would make use of tiny disturbances in magnetic orientation, which have been dubbed “skyrmions.” These virtual particles, which occur on a thin metallic film sandwiched against a film of different metal, can be manipulated and controlled using electric fields, and can store data for long periods without the need for further energy input. In 2016, a team led by MIT associate professor of materials science and engineering Geoffrey Beach documented the existence of skyrmions, but the particles’ locations on a surface were entirely random. Now, Beach has collaborated with others to demonstrate experimentally for the first time that they can create these particles at will in specific locations, which is the next key requirement for using them in a data storage system. An efficient system for reading that data will also be needed to create a commercializable system. The new findings are reported this week in the journal Nature Nanotechnology, in a paper by Beach, MIT postdoc Felix Buettner, and graduate student Ivan Lemesh, and 10 others at MIT and in Germany."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/fast-moving-magnetic-particles-new-form-data-storage-1002">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Picture two schools of fish swimming in clockwise and counterclockwise circles. It’s enough to make your head spin, and now scientists at Rutgers University-New Brunswick and the University of Florida have discovered the “chiral spin mode” – a sea of electrons spinning in opposing circles. “We discovered a new collective spin mode that can be used to transport energy or information with very little energy dissipation, and it can be a platform for building novel electronic devices such as computers and processors,” said Girsh Blumberg, senior author of the study and a professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy in Rutgers’ School of Arts and Sciences. Collective chiral spin modes are propagating waves of electron spins that do not carry a charge current but modify the “spinning” directions of electrons. “Chiral” refers to entities, like your right and left hands, that are matching but asymmetrical and can’t be superimposed on their mirror image. The study, led by Hsiang-Hsi (Sean) Kung, a graduate student in Blumberg’s Rutgers Laser Spectroscopy Lab, was published in Physical Review Letters."</em> <a href="https://news.rutgers.edu/sea-spinning-electrons/20171001">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A new form of compact cooling technology developed for space astronomy could pave the way for use of advanced superconducting detectors for better cancer treatments, driverless cars and practical quantum communications. In a Letter published in the journal Superconductor Science and Technology, researchers from the University of Glasgow and the STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory describe how they have developed a supercooled detector platform capable of detecting single photons. This compact and robust platform has low enough power consumption to be used outside of a laboratory environment for the first time.Cooler Their research builds on existing developments in extremely sensitive light sensors known as superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs). SNSPDs are capable of detecting individual light quanta – photons – even at infrared wavelengths. While SNSPDs have facilitated numerous significant advances in quantum science over the last decade, they need to be cooled to a just few degrees above absolute zero (−273.15 °C) in order to work effectively - a process which requires expensive and hazardous liquid helium, or a great deal of electrical power to achieve. The research team from Glasgow and Rutherford Appleton labs have developed a more portable, less power-hungry platform for SNSPDs which opens up a wide range of new applications for the technology."</em> <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/news/headline_551407_en.html">[...]</a>

The technique offers scientists and engineers a simple, cost-effective method to make thin, uniform layers of these materials, which could expand capabilities for devices from solar cells to cell phones. Stacking thin layers of materials offers a range of possibilities for making electronic devices with unique properties.

Data is recorded at the interfaces of the superlattice layers. When the atoms at the interface are disordered, the material has a high electrical resistance while the ordered interface has a low electrical resistance. Since only the interface switches, a subset of layers within the material can remain unchanged and crystalline. This means that the interface can be engineered by the non-switching layers - the entire structure need not switch into a disordered state. This makes the superlattice very different to unstructured phase change memory alloys, such as the Ge2Sb2Te5 alloy."</em> <a href="http://sglinks.news/article/44f519/straining-the-prototype-strain-engineered-materials-are-the-future-of-data-storage">[...]</a>

Finding a solution to this impending technical bottleneck is a major problem for the semiconductor industry. One promising possibility involves reducing the resistivity size effect by altering the crystalline orientation of interconnect materials. A pair of researchers from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute conducted electron transport measurements in epitaxial single-crystal layers of tungsten (W) as one such potential interconnect solution. They performed first-principles simulations, finding a definite orientation-dependent effect. The anisotropic resistivity effect they found was most marked between layers with two particular orientations of the lattice structure, namely W(001) and W(110)."</em> <a href="https://publishing.aip.org/publishing/journal-highlights/tungsten-offers-nano-interconnects-path-least-resistance">[...]</a>

Sometimes just cutting power would be a convenient timesaver, or a system may be left to non-technical users. For installations that don’t require creating or modifying files — such as a dedicated slideshow kiosk — we can configure the operating system to make it more resistant to unplanned power cuts. The Concern Linux — or any substantial computer operating system, Windows and Mac are the same way — behind the scenes they’re reading and writing all manner of temporary data to drives (or the SD card with Raspberry Pi). This is why we normally use the shutdown command: all those files are put away in a known valid state. But if power is unexpectedly cut, these lingering half-written files can render a card unbootable…one can try patching it up, but sometimes there’s no recourse but to wipe the card and reinstall everything."</em> <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/read-only-raspberry-pi?view=all">[...]</a>

As soon as the set weight is reached, the vibrating motor is switched off and the scale is tilted. Configuration options: The weight can be set via a menu. The mechanism is started via three modes, which can also be set via the menu: by means of a time switch (time - the countdown can be set), by an external signal (input - eg closing a button) or by both options at the same time."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/S%C3%BC%C3%9Figkeitenautomat-Candy-Vending-Machine/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Digital clocks usually have very confusing user interfaces to set the time. They require holding down buttons to go between different modes, and often you can only increment the time, for example, if you want to decrement one minute, you need to press a button 59 times. This was the main reason I created this clock. This clock is based on an Arduino NANO, since that was what I had laying around, but almost any Arduino would work. I use a DS3232RCT module to keep track of the time. Since it has a battery backup it keeps the time during power failures, or if the clock is moved to a different position/power outlet."</em> <a href="http://axelsdiy.brinkeby.se/?page_id=1485">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Three researchers from Michigan State University have developed a low-cost, open-source fingerprint reader which can detect fake prints. They call it RaspiReader, and they’ve built it using a Raspberry Pi 3 and two Camera Modules. Joshua and his colleagues have just uploaded all the info you need to build your own version — let’s go! We’ve probably all seen a movie in which a burglar crosses a room full of laser tripwires and then enters the safe full of loot by tricking the fingerprint-secured lock with a fake print. Turns out, the second part is not that unrealistic: you can fake fingerprints using a range of materials, such as glue or latex. If the spoof print layer capping the spoofer’s finger is thin enough, it can even fool readers that detect blood flow, pulse, or temperature."</em> <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspireader-fingerprint-scanner/">[...]</a>

On one side of my family runs a genetic condition known as Retinitis Pigmentosathis is essentially a condition that causes your eyesight to deteriorate over time. Often, this makes me think about how the technology that we create could actually make a difference to someones life and how we, as creators, could be a part of that.Because of this, a few years ago (using an Arduino Uno) I created a refreshable braille display that essentially took a text file and displayed the contents in the form of braille. Now that Android Things is available and I had picked up a kit from pimoroni, I decided to revisit this project and take it up a notch to create BrailleBox. In this article well be looking at what BrailleBox is, how it was constructed and the little amount of code that it took to create it.Wait, what is BrailleBox?"</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/hitherejoe/braillebox-braille-news-reader-e86060">[...]</a>

DescriptionNematoduino is an Arduino UNO-compatible robotic simulation of the C. elegans nematode.At the core of the simulation is a spiking neural network incorporating 300 neuron cells of thebiological worm's connectome, along with associated muscle cells. This implementation is based onprior work [1], but with the following improvements:A compressed representation of the connectome network (8 kilobytes)Ability to run on the extremely flexible Arduino UNO platformA biologically motivated conntectome-motor interfaceIn its current form the nematoduino software consumes 13542 bytes (42%) of the program memoryof an UNO-compatible board, and 825 bytes (40%) of the SRAM, leaving plenty of room for experimentationand further development. It's my hope that nematoduino will end up in the hands of a lot of studentsand neurorobotics hobbyists!LocomotionAs in Ref. 1, either the chemotaxis ("smell finding") or nose touch neurons are stimulated depending on whetherthe ultrasonic sensor has been triggered. A flow chart representing how sensor state feeds through the connectomesimulation and out through the motors is given in Figure 1."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/nategri/nematoduino-99f2a6">[...]</a>
