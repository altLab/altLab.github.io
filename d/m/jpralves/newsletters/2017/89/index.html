<p>Hoje é o aniversário de <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Fergason">James Fergason</a>. Este inventor Norte-Americano nascido em 1934 ficou conhecido pelo seu trabalho no melhoramento do LCD (Ecran de Cristais Liquidos). A companhia detida por este inventor produziu o primeiro relógio de pulso usando este tipo de ecran. Faz também hoje anos que nasceu <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Baptist_van_Helmont">Jan Baptist van Helmont</a>. Este quimico belga, nasceu em 1580 e ficou conhecido por ter introduzido no vocabulário dos cientistas a palavra "gás".</p>

<p>Esta semana a Alphabet - empresa mãe da Google - anunciou que vai abandonar o prjeto de Internet através do drone Titan. Custos de exploração e rentabilidade da solução estarão na origem da decisão. A Intel, BMW e Mobileye irão ter veiculo de condução autonoma no segundo semestre do ano de 2017. Esta revelação foi feita na CES 2017 e a BMW afirmou que com tecnologia das outras duas companhias vai usar nos seus veiculos da serie 7. A Renualt anunciou que a plataforma de hardware do seu carro electrico compacto - o Twizy EV - vai ser disponibilizada em open source. Isto irá permitir que quem quiser iniciar ou construir o seu veiculo electrico poderá baseá-lo nesta plataforma.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como alguns modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis.</p>

<p><em>"In 2014, Google and Facebook Inc. vied to acquire Titan Aerospace, a maker of high-altitude, solar-powered drones. Google won the bidding, so Facebook purchased its own company, which was building a huge glider called Aquila. The idea was to beam internet access from the sky to get more people logging on from remote places to access information and probably use both companies’ web services. That soaring vision has come down to Earth with a bump. On Wednesday, a spokeswoman from Google parent Alphabet Inc.’s X research lab said it had shut down Titan. This happened in early 2016, she said, although confirmation didn’t come until earlier today, when technology blog 9to5Google reported the move. The team from Titan was brought into X in late 2015, and the research lab ended its exploration of high-altitude drones for internet access shortly after, the X spokeswoman said in a statement."</em> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-11/alphabet-says-it-shut-down-titan-drone-internet-project">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"BMW Group, Intel and Mobileye today announced that a fleet of approximately 40 autonomous BMW vehicles will be on the roads by the second half of 2017, demonstrating the significant advancements made by the three companies towards fully autonomous driving. Revealing this at a podium discussion held during a joint press conference at CES, the companies further explained that the BMW 7 Series will employ cutting-edge Intel and Mobileye technologies during global trials starting in the U.S. and Europe. This news follows the partnership that was announced between the BMW Group, Intel and Mobileye in July of last year. The companies have since developed a scalable architecture that can be adopted by other automotive developers and carmakers to pursue state of the art designs and create differentiated brands. The offerings scale from individual key integrated modules to a complete end-to-end solution providing a wide range of differentiated consumer experiences."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/bmw-group-intel-mobileye-will-autonomous-test-vehicles-roads-second-half-2017/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Renault has developed an open-source automotive platform for a compact and lightweight electric vehicle, based on its existing Twizy EV, which could enable those wanting to build their own electric vehicle company to jumpstart the process. In partnership with OSVehicle and ARM, Groupe Renault will release its POM platform to the world as the "first open-source mass market vehicle platform," which will allow third parties to both copy and modify the existing hardware and software to create their own version of a totally customizable EV. Although OSVehicle already has an open-source vehicle platform available - the TABBY EVO - which is the basis of the Busy Bee (the first open-source road-legal city car built on it), this new partnership marks the first time a big automaker is open-sourcing its EV platform, and could be the start of a whole new breed of electric vehicle innovation. A platform isn't a finished vehicle, and isn't road-legal on its own, but is rather the core systems around which a complete vehicle is built."</em> <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/cars/renault-will-release-its-twizy-ev-hardware-system-opensource-platform.html">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"A team of researchers at MIT has designed one of the strongest lightweight materials known, by compressing and fusing flakes of graphene, a two-dimensional form of carbon. The new material, a sponge-like configuration with a density of just 5 percent, can have a strength 10 times that of steel. In its two-dimensional form, graphene is thought to be the strongest of all known materials. But researchers until now have had a hard time translating that two-dimensional strength into useful three-dimensional materials. The new findings show that the crucial aspect of the new 3-D forms has more to do with their unusual geometrical configuration than with the material itself, which suggests that similar strong, lightweight materials could be made from a variety of materials by creating similar geometric features."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2017/3-d-graphene-strongest-lightest-materials-0106">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="https://today.duke.edu/2017/01/nanowire-inks-enable-paper-based-printable-electronics">Nanowire 'inks' enable paper-based printable electronics</a></h2>

<p><em>"By suspending tiny metal nanoparticles in liquids, Duke University scientists are brewing up conductive ink-jet printer “inks” to print inexpensive, customizable circuit patterns on just about any surface. Printed electronics, which are already being used on a wide scale in devices such as the anti-theft radio frequency identification (RFID) tags you might find on the back of new DVDs, currently have one major drawback: for the circuits to work, they first have to be heated to melt all the nanoparticles together into a single conductive wire, making it impossible to print circuits on inexpensive plastics or paper. A new study by Duke researchers shows that tweaking the shape of the nanoparticles in the ink might just eliminate the need for heat. By comparing the conductivity of films made from different shapes of silver nanostructures, the researchers found that electrons zip through films made of silver nanowires much easier than films made from other shapes, like nanospheres or microflakes. In fact, electrons flowed so easily through the nanowire films that they could function in printed circuits without the need to melt them all together."</em> <a href="https://today.duke.edu/2017/01/nanowire-inks-enable-paper-based-printable-electronics">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="https://research.googleblog.com/2016/11/enhance-raisr-sharp-images-with-machine.html">Enhance! RAISR Sharp Images with Machine Learning</a></h2>

<p><em>"Everyday the web is used to share and store millions of pictures, enabling one to explore the world, research new topics of interest, or even share a vacation with friends and family. However, many of these images are either limited by the resolution of the device used to take the picture, or purposely degraded in order to accommodate the constraints of cell phones, tablets, or the networks to which they are connected. With the ubiquity of high-resolution displays for home and mobile devices, the demand for high-quality versions of low-resolution images, quickly viewable and shareable from a wide variety of devices, has never been greater. With “RAISR: Rapid and Accurate Image Super-Resolution”, we introduce a technique that incorporates machine learning in order to produce high-quality versions of low-resolution images. RAISR produces results that are comparable to or better than the currently available super-resolution methods, and does so roughly 10 to 100 times faster, allowing it to be run on a typical mobile device in real-time. Furthermore, our technique is able to avoid recreating the aliasing artifacts that may exist in the lower resolution image.

The findings — based on an analysis of minerals from the moon called zircons that were brought back to Earth by the Apollo 14 mission in 1971 — are published Jan. 11 in the journal Science Advances. The moon’s age has been a hotly debated topic, even though scientists have tried to settle the question over many years and using a wide range of scientific techniques."</em> <a href="http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/the-moon-is-older-than-scientists-thought-ucla-led-research-team-reports">[...]</a></p>

How much cooler would it be to have a tiny and affordable device displaying a map with airplanes on it, just like the apps you have on your smart phone? The idea kept coming back to me but one important puzzle piece was missing: the TFT library could only display raw bitmap files (BMP) and I didn’t know of any mapping service which would let you download bmp images. Of course, I could have built a web service which would have converted JPEGs and PNGs to BMPs on the fly but that wasn’t really my goal.

It can be used for both digital and "analogous" cameras or for a remote synchronization of the actual flash units. Its use is optimal especially with digital cameras (DC), where extraordinary adaptability for different systems will stand out. It is capable of eliminating the effect of any measuring pre-flashes. The synchronizer thus perfectly fulfils the role of a device often called the Slave Flash Trigger (SFT). Thanks to an optical coupling, it enables safely to use even the oldest flashguns that could otherwise damage DC by high voltage ignition. The Slave Flash Trigger enables to place the external flashgun in the close proximity of DC, but thanks to high sensitivity the flashgun can be even tens of metres away from the camera, if needed. Having such sensitivity, the device is remarkable with high resistance against the effects of ambient lighting and the interference by varying light sources. Also, the operation outside under sunshine does not make problems for it thanks to an adaptation algorithm. Not a negligible advantage is the possibility of its simple and safe application with cameras to which otherwise the external flashguns cannot be connected at all."</em> <a href="http://www.fancon.cz/slave-flash-trigger/slave-flash-en.html">[...]</a></p>

One of my newest designs is a robot that I think is quite adorable: Chip-E. Chip-E started as a personal project to cheer me up during a rough time due to the loss of a family member. Having a supply of RobotGeek components on hand, I thought about a simple bipedal design, but having built some of the other 4-servo bipeds out there, I wanted to do something different. Chip-E has an LCD for “eyes” enabling visual feedback, a piezoelectric buzzer for auditory feedback, and an IR sensor for control. These features are complemented by 4 strong RGS-13 servos and the ability to add more sensors. Like his sibling Eddie, Chip-E is designed to be easy to 3D print and to bring joy to those who appreciate him. (Many makers may recognize the symbolism of the “dot” and notched corner, giving him the look of a microchip.)"</em> <a href="http://makezine.com/projects/chip-e-bipedal-bot/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"The DRV101 is a low-side power switch employing a pulse-width modulated (PWM) output. Its rugged design is optimized for driving electromechanical devices such as valves, solenoids, relays, actuators, and positioners. The DRV101 module is also ideal for driving thermal devices such as heaters and lamps. PWM operation conserves power and reduces heat rise, resulting in higher reliability. In addition, adjustable PWM potentiometer allows fine control of the power delivered to the load. Time from dc output to PWM output is externally adjustable. The DRV101 can be set to provide a strong initial closure, automatically switching to a soft hold mode for power savings. Duty cycle can be controlled by a potentiometer, analog voltage, or digital-to-analog converter for versatility. A flag output LED D2 indicates thermal shutdown and over/under current limit. A wide supply range allows use with a variety of actuators."</em> <a href="http://www.electronics-lab.com/project/9v-to-60v-pwm-2-3a-solenoid-valve-driver-using-drv101/">[...]</a></p>

Nothing to say in particular, it’s just an other I2C-small-package-sensor. Or rather SMBus, but apart from the minimum speed clock requirements on the SMBus, the two protocols are alike. On boot-up, the sensor gets configured and put to shutdown mode. Then, I use the “One Shot conversion” feature. When the right command is sent, the sensor starts a one-time temperature acquisition and returns to shutdown state, allowing to save as much as energy as possible. The precision of the sensor is typically 0.5°C over its standard temperature range (-25°C to +85°C, the one I’ll be using) and the resolution is 0,0625°C (the LSB). The temperature results are read on two bytes (12bits resolution). The first byte is the number before the comma, 2’s complemented for negative temperatures. The second byte contains the number after the comma.

However, only 14 out of the 100 million Americans hop on a bike at least twice a week. The highest cited reason behind Americans' hesitation of everyday cycling is the fear of being struck by a vehicle on the road. The statistics seem to back them up. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, 45,000 cyclists were injured in traffic in 2015, with 818 being killed on U.S. roads. The issue lies behind drivers’ and cyclists’ inattention to road laws, as well as the lack of effective space between drivers and cyclists. If there was a simple means to incentivize more of the population to commute or exercise via cycling, much of the population could reap enormous health benefits, as well as contribute to decreasing the amount of carbon dioxide spewed out annually by commuters. We see the inherent risks in cycling, so we wanted to provide a means to address the hazards cyclists see everyday on the road. The U.S. Department of Transportation identified parallel-path events (e.g. cars or cyclists merging lanes) as one of the most common causes of bicycle-motor vehicle accidents.

<p><em>"Prototyping is a dangerous job. Not for a person if you keep the voltage down but for the components. On breadboard misplaced chips, loose connection and other errors can blow the components. To save them a fuse is a good idea. Having said that, standard fuses are not very suitable for breadboarding. Blow fuses have the inherent problem of being a one-time component. And during prototyping, a lot of overcurrent conditions can happen. A better way is to use a resettable fuse, also known as PTC. After tripping, it turns into a high-impedance state and remains tripped until the overcurrent condition is removed. But they have disadvantages too. Just like the ordinary blow fuse, the tripping time depends on how much current is passed. For example, to achieve 1 millisecond breaking time a quick blow 1-amp fuse needs to pass 10 amps. For 1-amp PTC at 10 amps, the tripping time is around 100 milliseconds. That is way too long and way too much current. Moreover, resettable fuse still leaks some current in its tripped state because it has to keep being hot."</em> <a href="https://kaktuscircuits.blogspot.pt/2014/06/bfuse-electronic-fuse-for-breadboard.html">[...]</a></p>
