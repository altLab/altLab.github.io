<p>Foi a 16 de Março de 1789 que nasceu <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Ohm">Georg Ohm</a>. Este físico e matemático alemão, ficou conhecido pela Lei que tem o seu nome. Enquanto professor, Ohm começou as suas pesquisas com a nova célula electroquímica que tinha sido inventada por Alexander Volta e, usando um equipamento por si criado, descobriu que existe uma proporcionalidade directa entre a diferença de potencial (tensão) aplicada a um condutor e a corrente eléctrica resultante.
Faz, também anos hoje que nascia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman">Richard Stallman</a>. Nascido em Nova-Iorque, este norte-americano foi o responsável pelo lançamento em 1983 do movimento open-source GNU Project. É o criador do famoso GNU Emacs e participou a criação do Compilador de C da GNU - GCC. É o fundador da FSF - Free Software Foundation e foi um pioneiro na definição do conceito de "Copyleft". Deste conceito nasceu posteriormente a licença GPL - GNU General Public License.
Faz anos hoje também o norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_S._Tanenbaum">Andrew S. Tanenbaum</a>. Este professor de ciências da computação é conhecido por ter criado um clone do UNIX, designado por MINIX e pelos seus livros relacionados com sistemas operativos. O seu livro "Operating Systems: Design and Implementation" e o MINIX serviram de inspiração para que Linus Torvalds criasse o Linux.</p>

<p>Esta semana ficámos a saber que a China está a preparar uma missão tripulada à Lua. A Intel anunciou a aquisição da empresa de origem Israelita Mobileye. Esta empresa é uma empresa tecnológica que desenvolve sistemas de apoio avançado à condução. Este passo é sem dúvida uma consolidação do interesse que a Intel tem na área dos veículos de condução autónoma e que vai ser sem duvida o grande desafio dos tempos mais próximos. Por fim, a Google anunciou um novo codificador de ficheiros JPEG designado por Guetzli, que mantendo a compatibilidade com o formato consegue taxas de compressão 35% melhores que os atuais sistemas, mantendo a qualidade. Este sistema foi disponibilizado em Open-Source.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como alguns modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis. É apresentado também dois livros, um sobre uma coleção de circuitos com Op Amp e outro sobre o Raspberry Pi para a Educação. Saiu também a revista newelectronics de 14 de Março.</p>

<p><em>"Intel and Mobileye announced on March 13 that they have entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which Intel will acquire Mobileye. Under the terms of the agreement, a subsidiary of Intel will commence a tender offer to acquire all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Mobileye for $63.54 per share in cash, representing a fully-diluted equity value of approximately $15.3 billion and an enterprise value of $14.7 billion. The acquisition will couple the best-in-class technologies from both companies, including Intel’s high-performance computing and connectivity expertise and Mobileye’s leading computer vision expertise to create automated driving solutions from the cloud through the network to the car. The combination is expected to accelerate innovation for the automotive industry and position Intel as a leading technology provider in the fast-growing market for highly and fully autonomous vehicles. Intel estimates the vehicle systems, data and services market opportunity to be up to $70 billion by 2030. The transaction extends Intel’s strategy to invest in data-intensive market opportunities that build on the company’s strengths in computing and connectivity from the cloud, through the network, to the device."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/intel-acquire-mobileye/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"At Google, we care about giving users the best possible online experience, both through our own services and products and by contributing new tools and industry standards for use by the online community. That’s why we’re excited to announce Guetzli, a new open source algorithm that creates high quality JPEG images with file sizes 35% smaller than currently available methods, enabling webmasters to create webpages that can load faster and use even less data. Guetzli [guɛtsli] — cookie in Swiss German — is a JPEG encoder for digital images and web graphics that can enable faster online experiences by producing smaller JPEG files while still maintaining compatibility with existing browsers, image processing applications and the JPEG standard. From the practical viewpoint this is very similar to our Zopfli algorithm, which produces smaller PNG and gzip files without needing to introduce a new format; and different than the techniques used in RNN-based image compression, RAISR, and WebP, which all need client and ecosystem changes for compression gains at internet scale."</em> <a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2017/03/guetzli-new-open-source-jpeg-encoder.html">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"If someone asks you to hand them a wrench from a table full of different sized wrenches, you’d probably pause and ask, “which one?” Robotics researchers from Brown University have now developed an algorithm that lets robots do the same thing — ask for clarification when they’re not sure what a person wants. The research, which will be presented this spring at the International Conference on Robotics and Automation in Singapore, comes from Brown’s Humans to Robots Lab led by computer science professor Stefanie Tellex. Her work focuses on human-robot collaboration — making robots that can be good helpers to people at home and in the workplace."</em> <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2017/03/fetch">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/artificial-intelligence-and-robots-to-make-offshore-windfarms-safer-and-cheaper/">Artificial intelligence and robots to make offshore windfarms safer and cheaper</a></h2>

<p><em>"The University of Manchester is leading a consortium to investigate advanced technologies, including robotics and artificial intelligence, for the operation and maintenance of offshore windfarms. The remote inspection and asset management of offshore wind farms and their connection to the shore is an industry which will be worth up to £2 billion annually by 2025 in the UK alone. Eighty to ninety percent of the cost of offshore operation and maintenance according to the Crown Estate is generated by the need to get site access – in essence get engineers and technicians to remote sites to evaluate a problem and decide what action to undertake. Such inspection takes place in a remote and hazardous environment and requires highly trained personnel of which there is likely to be a shortage in coming years. The £5m project will investigate the use of advanced sensing, robotics, virtual reality models and artificial intelligence to reduce maintenance cost and effort. Predictive and diagnostic techniques will allow problems to be picked up early, when easy and inexpensive maintenance will allow problems to be readily fixed. Robots and advanced sensors will be used to minimise the need for human intervention in the hazardous offshore environment."</em> <a href="http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/artificial-intelligence-and-robots-to-make-offshore-windfarms-safer-and-cheaper/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Articles such as clothes, watches, shoes, and accessories are essential to people around the world. However, going beyond the basic roles and purposes of these items, the concept of “wearability” is rapidly evolving to include computing power and the ability to connect to the internet. In other words, information, communication, and technology (ICT) are beginning to be integrated into wearables. Because wearable electronics can provide a more comfortable and convenient life for wearers, research on and the development of wearables have emerged as major interests both academically and industrially. In particular, a wearable information display for intuitive communication between wearers and wearable devices has attracted a great deal of attention, and it can create additional value in the fashion, military, automobile, and architecture industries while also making functional wearable devices available to all."</em> <a href="http://www.nanowerk.com/nanotechnology-news/newsid=45993.php">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/en/science/photonics/news/6503/">New Material Makes it Possible to Record Data with Light</a></h2>

<p><em>"Russian physicists with their colleagues from Europe through changing the light parameters, learned to generate quasiparticles — excitons, which were fully controllable and also helped to record information at room temperature. These particles act as a transitional form between photons and electrons so the researchers believe that with excitons, they will be able to create compact optoelectronic devices for rapid recording and processing an optical signal. The proposed method is based on the use of a special class of materials called metal-organic frameworks. The study appeared in Advanced Materials. To simplify the description of complex effects in quantum mechanics, scientists have introduced a concept of quasiparticles. One of them which is called exciton is an "electron — hole" pair, which provides energy transfer between photons and electrons. According to the scientific community, this mediation of quasiparticles will help to combine optics with electronics to create a fundamentally new class of equipment — more compact and energy efficient. However, all exciton demo devices either operate only at a low temperature, or are difficult to manufacture which inhibits their mass adoption."</em> <a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/en/science/photonics/news/6503/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"In the battle to apply deep-learning techniques to the real world, one company stands head and shoulders above the competition. Google’s DeepMind subsidiary has used the technique to create machines that can beat humans at video games and the ancient game of Go. And last year, Google Translate services significantly improved thanks to the behind-the-scenes introduction of deep-learning techniques. So it’s interesting to see how other companies are racing to catch up. Today, it is the turn of Baidu, an Internet search company that is sometimes described as the Chinese equivalent of Google. In 2013, Baidu opened an artificial intelligence research lab in Silicon Valley, raising an interesting question: what has it been up to? Now Baidu’s artificial intelligence lab has revealed its work on speech synthesis. One of the challenges in speech synthesis is to reduce the amount of fine-tuning that goes on behind the scenes. Baidu’s big breakthrough is to create a deep-learning machine that largely does away with this kind of meddling. The result is a text-to-speech system called Deep Voice that can learn to talk in just a few hours with little or no human interference."</em> <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603811/baidus-artificial-intelligence-lab-unveils-synthetic-speech-system/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Last month, Facebook announced software that could simply look at a photo and tell, for example, whether it was a picture of a cat or a dog. A related program identifies cancerous skin lesions as well as trained dermatologists can. Both technologies are based on neural networks, sophisticated computer algorithms at the cutting edge of artificial intelligence (AI)—but even their developers aren’t sure exactly how they work. Now, researchers have found a way to "look" at neural networks in action and see how they draw conclusions. Neural networks, also called neural nets, are loosely based on the brain’s use of layers of neurons working together. Like the human brain, they aren't hard-wired to produce a specific result—they “learn” on training sets of data, making and reinforcing connections between multiple inputs. A neural net might have a layer of neurons that look at pixels and a layer that looks at edges, like the outline of a person against a background. After being trained on thousands or millions of data points, a neural network algorithm will come up with its own rules on how to process new data. But it's unclear what the algorithm is using from those data to come to its conclusions."</em> <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/03/brainlike-computers-are-black-box-scientists-are-finally-peering-inside">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"The job would typically require a team on site using a variety of specialized tools and devices to perform tests and take measurements. Given the many interconnected components of modern bridges, some of which can be difficult to access, the labor is likely to be time-consuming and expensive. Now, says Andrea Richa, imagine the work could instead be done by a “smart” material, composed of many tiny sensors capable of detecting and measuring such things as temperature, traffic, and structural cracks and stresses. This “smart” network of tiny sensors would be achieved through the use of “programmable material” — material that can monitor and respond to its environment — consisting of “self-organizing” particles that could coat the surface of bridge components or any other objects."</em> <a href="https://asunow.asu.edu/20170306-opening-paths-progress-programmable-materials">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"The brain is soft and electronics are stiff, which can make combining the two challenging, such as when neuroscientists implant electrodes to measure brain activity and perhaps deliver tiny jolts of electricity for pain relief or other purposes. Chemical engineer Zhenan Bao is trying to change that. For more than a decade, her lab has been working to make electronics soft and flexible so that they feel and operate almost like a second skin. Along the way, the team has started to focus on making brittle plastics that can conduct electricity more elastic. Now in Science Advances, Bao’s team describes how they took one such brittle plastic and modified it chemically to make it as bendable as a rubber band, while slightly enhancing its electrical conductivity. The result is a soft, flexible electrode that is compatible with our supple and sensitive nerves."</em> <a href="http://news.stanford.edu/2017/03/10/stretchy-electrode-paves-way-flexible-electronics/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Will artificial intelligence (AI) change the nature of work? For EPFL theoretical biologist Marcel Salathé, the answer is invariably yes. To him, a more fundamental question that needs to be addressed is who owns that artificial intelligence? “We have to hold AI accountable, and the only way to do this is to verify it for biases and make sure there is no deliberate misinformation,” says Salathé. “This is not possible if the AI is privatized.” AI is both the algorithm and the data. So what exactly is AI? It is generally regarded as “intelligence exhibited by machines”. Today, it is highly task specific, specially designed to beat humans at strategic games like Chess and Go, or diagnose skin disease on par with doctors’ skills. On a practical level, AI is implemented through what scientists call “machine learning”, which means using a computer to run specifically designed software that can be “trained”, i.e. process data with the help of algorithms and to correctly identify certain features from that data set. Like human cognition, AI learns by trial and error. Unlike humans, however, AI can process and recall large quantities of data, giving it a tremendous advantage over us."</em> <a href="http://actu.epfl.ch/news/is-reliable-artificial-intelligence-possible/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"IT’S an absolute. Mathematics has put speed limits on cooling, finally proving a century-old law – that unless you have infinite time and resources, you can’t get to the absolute zero of temperature. In 1906, German chemist Walther Nernst formulated the heat theorem, which states that as a perfect crystal approaches the absolute zero point of 0 kelvin  (-273.15°C), the system’s entropy also goes to zero. This work earned him the 1920 Nobel prize in chemistry. The rule was controversial, with heavyweights like Albert Einstein and Max Planck debating it and introducing their own formulations. In 1912, Nernst defended his version by adding another clause, the unattainability principle, which states that absolute zero is physically unreachable. Taken together, these two rules make up the modern third law of thermodynamics. But because earlier arguments focused only on specific mechanisms or were crippled by questionable assumptions, some physicists have always remained unconvinced of its validity."</em> <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2124597-cooling-to-absolute-zero-mathematically-outlawed-after-a-century/">[...]</a></p>

In the same way that avionics allow a pilot to fly a plane by instrument solely based on read-outs from the cockpit, the surgical robot developed by the researchers for RCI has the capabilities to perform surgery that a surgeon cannot carry out manually without a robot. To embed an electronic cochlear implant device into the ear of a deaf patient, the surgeon has to create a precise access from behind the ear, through the skull bone all the way into the inner ear. The implant electrode that bridges the damaged part of the inner ear to allow the patient to hear again is then carefully inserted into the cochlea through the access in the bone. Currently this procedure is carried out manually and the ear, nose and throat surgeon directly views the access into the cochlea through the opening in the skull bone."</em> <a href="http://www.unibe.ch/news/media_news/media_relations_e/media_releases/2017_e/media_releases_2017/instrument_flight_to_the_inner_ear/index_eng.html">[...]</a></p>

The “original” version from the 1970’s used B7971 nixie alphanumeric tubes. These tubes are getting hard to find and they’re certainly expensive. They also require interfacing with high voltage and an understanding of multiplexing. This version uses a slightly more modern and easier to use display while maintaining the overall glowy, multi-segment look of the original. The Siemens DL2146T is a 4-character, 16-segment (plus dot) intelligent display. It has built-in drive and an ASCII font table. You basically send it seven bits of ASCII along with a couple more bits that select the position and control reset, blanking and chip select.

<p><em>"The revolutionary Intel 8008 microprocessor is 45 years old today (March 13, 2017), so I figured it's time for a blog post on reverse-engineering its internal circuits. One of the interesting things about old computers is how they implemented things in unexpected ways, and the 8008 is no exception. Compared to modern architectures, one unusual feature of the 8008 is it had an on-chip stack for subroutine calls, rather than storing the stack in RAM. And instead of using normal binary counters for the stack, the 8008 saved a few gates by using shift-register counters that generated pseudo-random values. In this article, I reverse-engineer these circuits from die photos and explain how they work. The image below shows the 8008's tiny silicon die, highly magnified. Around the outside of the die, you can see the 18 wires connecting the die to the chip's external pins. The 8008's circuitry is built from about 3500 tiny transistors (yellow) connected by a metal wiring layer (white).

A wozItDo has just one button and three LEDs and all you have to do is to work out what it does. Beware: it's deceptively tricky and once you think you've cracked it, there's still more. So what's with the name? We'll about 30 years ago I made my first "computer". A 6502 MPU with a keypad, some 7-segment LEDs and a handful of other bits. I was inordinately proud of it but when I showed it off to other people they seemed unimpressed and often asked "But what's it do?" Nothing, really, but that's not the point. When I started playing with the ATTINY85 I was super impressed. It's this understated little 8 pin DIL that costs &lt;$2 but burred inside is the enormous complexity of a full blown ATMEL MCU. And all you need to give it is power. wozItDo is in that spirit. It looks disarmingly simple but there a lot more than first meets the eye. To give you an idea there's about 1200 lines of source code packed away inside that tiny 8 pin chip."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/tonymcgregor/wozitdo-tiny-iq-puzzel-big-challenge-ae8d57">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?1L02">Audio Pitch Shifter</a></h2>

<p><em>"This article describes a simple device based on an ATtiny85 that takes an audio input, shifts its pitch up or down in real time, and plays it through a loudspeaker. You can increase or decrease the pitch shift using two pushbuttons: For example, you can plug in an mp3 music player or phone, play some music, and change the pitch of a male singer's voice to a female voice as it's playing. Although the result is not hi-fi quality, it's an excellent demonstration of how much you can achieve with a single ATtiny85. The chip first amplifies the input by a factor of x20, digitizes it, stores the samples in a circular buffer under interrupt, reads samples back from the circular buffer under a separate timer interrupt, and finally converts the processed digital signal back to analogue, using high-speed PWM, and outputs it to a loudspeaker. Two pushbuttons cause interrupts which change the pitch shift up or down."</em> <a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?1L02">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Using an Arduino Uno along with a Raspberry Pi for control, hacker “HomoFaciens” came up with this clever delta-style robot. If you were going to make a robot with five servos, many Makers would make a robot arm with them and call it a day. HomoFaciens, however, who is known for making amazing machines with minimal tools and improvised materials, instead made something that seems to be a cross between a delta robot and a Skycam. His device, called “WinchBot,” uses three winches attached to an equilateral triangle frame to move a slider on a central pivoting square rod. This allows the robot’s 5-axis “hand” to be positioned within the robot’s work area. The servos are then tasked with keeping everything in the correct orientation, as well as opening and closing the gripper as needed."</em> <a href="http://www.homofaciens.de/technics-machines-winchbot_en.htm">[...]</a></p>
