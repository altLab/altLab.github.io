<h2><a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6746">Lasers Could Give Space Research its 'Broadband' Moment</a></h2>

<p><em>"Thought your Internet speeds were slow? Try being a space scientist for a day. The vast distances involved will throttle data rates to a trickle. You're lucky if a spacecraft can send more than a few megabits per second (Mbps) -- a pittance even by dial-up standards. But we might be on the cusp of a change. Just as going from dial-up to broadband revolutionized the Internet and made high-resolution photos and streaming video a given, NASA may be ready to undergo a similar "broadband" moment in coming years. The key to that data revolution will be lasers. For almost 60 years, the standard way to "talk" to spacecraft has been with radio waves, which are ideal for long distances. But optical communications, in which data is beamed over laser light, can increase that rate by as much as 10 to 100 times."</em> <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6746">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Gravity is a good thing when it keeps you firmly planted on Earth’s surface, but it’s quite a nuisance when you’re trying to launch things into space. The economics of space launches are harsh; every ounce sent up has an astronomical cost attached, but the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) just set an efficiency world record. It successfully launched 104 satellites into space with a single rocket. A lot of them were very small, but that’s still a big achievement. The launch was carried out with a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), an expendable launch system developed by India specifically to get multiple satellites into orbit in a single rocket. It was previously used to launch 17 satellites from countries like Canada, the UK, and the US into space. That was impressive enough, but the new 104-satellite launch shatters the old record held by Russia of 37 satellites in a single launch. That one was set back in 2014."</em> <a href="https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/244486-india-sets-world-record-104-satellites-single-launch">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Researchers from the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) have developed a new flow battery that stores energy in organic molecules dissolved in neutral pH water. This new chemistry allows for a non-toxic, non-corrosive battery with an exceptionally long lifetime and offers the potential to significantly decrease the costs of production. The research, published in ACS Energy Letters, was led by Michael Aziz, the Gene and Tracy Sykes Professor of Materials and Energy Technologies and Roy Gordon, the Thomas Dudley Cabot Professor of Chemistry and Professor of Materials Science. Flow batteries store energy in liquid solutions in external tanks — the bigger the tanks, the more energy they store. Flow batteries are a promising storage solution for renewable, intermittent energy like wind and solar but today’s flow batteries often suffer degraded energy storage capacity after many charge-discharge cycles, requiring periodic maintenance of the electrolyte to restore the capacity."</em> <a href="http://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2017/02/long-lasting-flow-battery-could-run-for-more-than-decade-with-minimum-upkeep">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="https://www.fraunhofer.de/en/press/research-news/2017/february/components-with-responsibility.html">Components with responsibility</a></h2>

<p><em>"Industrial manufacturing usually follows rigidly programmed processes, in which individual work steps and machines are tightly scheduled. This makes production inflexible and causes problems if devices fail or unscheduled com- ponents need to be processed at short notice. At the Hannover Messe Preview on February 9, 2017, Fraunhofer developers will be presenting new software that allows each individual component to tell the machine what has to be done. By breaking away from central production planning, factories can achieve unprecedented agility and flexibility, very much in the spirit of Industrie 4.0. In today’s factories, components such as engine blocks or blanks for a turbine blade are processed in linked processes by multiple machines. The systems turn and mill each component and repeatedly measure it automatically as they do so. A timetable precisely defines the sequence of work steps and the machines and devices required to carry them out. However, such timetables work through the individual steps in rigid sequences. If machines fail or other components have to be prioritized because of customer requests, the manufacturer has to laboriously reschedule production or retool the machines. This costs time and money."</em> <a href="https://www.fraunhofer.de/en/press/research-news/2017/february/components-with-responsibility.html">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-receives-science-report-on-europa-lander-concept">NASA Receives Science Report on Europa Lander Concept</a></h2>

<p><em>"In early 2016, in response to a congressional directive, NASA’s Planetary Science Division began a pre-Phase A study to assess the science value and engineering design of a future Europa lander mission. NASA routinely conducts such studies -- known as Science Definition Team (SDT) reports -- long before the beginning of any mission to gain an understanding of the challenges, feasibility and science value of the potential mission. In June 2016, NASA convened a 21-member team of scientists for the SDT. Since then, the team has deliberated to define a workable and worthy set of science objectives and measurements for the mission concept, submitting a report to NASA on Feb. 7. The report lists three science goals for the mission. The primary goal is to search for evidence of life on Europa. The other goals are to assess the habitability of Europa by directly analyzing material from the surface, and to characterize the surface and subsurface to support future robotic exploration of Europa and its ocean. The report also describes some of the notional instruments that could be expected to perform measurements in support of these goals. Scientists agree that the evidence is quite strong that Europa, which is slightly smaller than Earth’s moon, has a global saltwater ocean beneath its icy crust. This ocean has at least twice as much water as Earth’s oceans. While recent discoveries have shown that many bodies in the solar system either have subsurface oceans now, or may have in the past, Europa is one of only two places where the ocean is understood to be in contact with a rocky seafloor (the other being Saturn's moon Enceladus). This rare circumstance makes Europa one of the highest priority targets in the search for present-day life beyond Earth."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-receives-science-report-on-europa-lander-concept">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"A team of University of Colorado Boulder engineers has developed a scalable manufactured metamaterial — an engineered material with extraordinary properties not found in nature — to act as a kind of air conditioning system for structures. It has the ability to cool objects even under direct sunlight with zero energy and water consumption. When applied to a surface, the metamaterial film cools the object underneath by efficiently reflecting incoming solar energy back into space while simultaneously allowing the surface to shed its own heat in the form of infrared thermal radiation. The new material, which is described today in the journal Science, could provide an eco-friendly means of supplementary cooling for thermoelectric power plants, which currently require large amounts of water and electricity to maintain the operating temperatures of their machinery."</em> <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/today/2017/02/09/newly-engineered-material-can-cool-roofs-structures-zero-energy-consumption">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"University of Pennsylvania researchers are now among the first to produce a single, three-atom-thick layer of a unique two-dimensional material called tungsten ditelluride. Their findings have been published in 2-D Materials. Unlike other two-dimensional materials, scientists believe tungsten ditelluride has what are called topological electronic states. This means that it can have many different properties not just one. When one thinks about two-dimensional materials, graphene is probably the first that comes to mind. The tightly packed, atomically thin sheet of carbon first produced in 2004 has inspired countless avenues in research that could revolutionize everything from technology to drinking water."</em> <a href="https://news.upenn.edu/news/penn-researchers-are-among-first-grow-versatile-two-dimensional-material">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Every other year, the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling hosts a competition in which computer systems designed by conference participants try to find the best solution to a planning problem, such as scheduling flights or coordinating tasks for teams of autonomous satellites. On all but the most straightforward problems, however, even the best planning algorithms still aren’t as effective as human beings with a particular aptitude for problem-solving — such as MIT students. Researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory are trying to improve automated planners by giving them the benefit of human intuition. By encoding the strategies of high-performing human planners in a machine-readable form, they were able to improve the performance of competition-winning planning algorithms by 10 to 15 percent on a challenging set of problems."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/human-intuition-planning-algorithms-0207">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"The butt of jokes as little as 10 years ago, automatic speech recognition is now on the verge of becoming people’s chief means of interacting with their principal computing devices. In anticipation of the age of voice-controlled electronics, MIT researchers have built a low-power chip specialized for automatic speech recognition. Whereas a cellphone running speech-recognition software might require about 1 watt of power, the new chip requires between 0.2 and 10 milliwatts, depending on the number of words it has to recognize. In a real-world application, that probably translates to a power savings of 90 to 99 percent, which could make voice control practical for relatively simple electronic devices. That includes power-constrained devices that have to harvest energy from their environments or go months between battery charges. Such devices form the technological backbone of what’s called the “internet of things,” or IoT, which refers to the idea that vehicles, appliances, civil-engineering structures, manufacturing equipment, and even livestock will soon have sensors that report information directly to networked servers, aiding with maintenance and the coordination of tasks."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/low-power-chip-speech-recognition-electronics-0213">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Researchers at IBM have created an elusive molecule by knocking around atoms using a needle-like microscope tip. The flat, triangular fragment of a mesh of carbon atoms, called triangulene, is too unstable to be made by conventional chemical synthesis, and could find use in electronics. This isn't the first time that atomic manipulation has been used to create unstable molecules that couldn’t be made conventionally — but this one is especially desirable. “Triangulene is the first molecule that we’ve made that chemists have tried hard, and failed, to make already,” says Leo Gross, who led the IBM team at the firm’s laboratories in Zurich, Switzerland. The creation of triangulene demonstrates a new type of chemical synthesis, says Philip Moriarty, a nanoscientist who specializes in molecular manipulation at the University of Nottingham, UK. In conventional synthesis, chemists react molecules together to build up larger structures. Here, by contrast, atoms on individual molecules were physically manipulated using a microscope."</em> <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/elusive-triangulene-created-by-moving-atoms-one-at-a-time-1.21462">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Theoretical physicists from ETH Zurich deliberately misled intelligent machines, and thus refined the process of machine learning. They created a new method that allows computers to categorise data – even when humans have no idea what this categorisation might look like. When computers independently identify bodies of water and their outlines in satellite images, or beat the world’s best professional players at the board game Go, then adaptive algorithms are working in the background. Programmers supply these algorithms with known examples in a training phase: images of bodies of water and land, or sequences of Go moves that have led to success or failure in tournaments. Similarly to how our brain nerve cells produce new networks during learning processes, the special algorithms adapt in the learning phase based on the examples presented to them. This continues until they are able to differentiate bodies of water from land in unknown photos, or successful sequences of moves from unsuccessful ones."</em> <a href="https://www.ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2017/02/success-by-deception.html">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Imagine patterning and visualizing silicon at the atomic level, something which, if done successfully, will revolutionize the quantum and classical computing industry. A team of University of Alberta scientists has done just that, led by a world-renowned physicist and his up-and-coming protégé. PhD student Taleana Huff teamed up with her supervisor Robert Wolkow to channel a technique called atomic force microscopy—or AFM—to pattern and image electronic circuits at the atomic level. This is the first time the powerful technique has been applied to atom-scale fabrication and imaging of a silicon surface, notoriously difficult because the act of applying the technique risks damaging the silicon. However, the reward is worth the risk, because this level of control could stimulate the revolution of the technology industry."</em> <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/science/science-news/2017/february/ultimate-green-technology">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Wireless power delivery has the potential to seamlessly power our electrical devices as easily as data is transmitted through the air. However, existing solutions are limited to near contact distances and do not provide the geometric freedom to enable automatic and un-aided charging. We introduce quasistatic cavity resonance (QSCR), which can enable purpose-built structures, such as cabinets, rooms, and warehouses, to generate quasistatic magnetic fields that safely deliver kilowatts of power to mobile receivers contained nearly anywhere within. A theoretical model of a quasistatic cavity resonator is derived, and field distributions along with power transfer efficiency are validated against measured results. An experimental demonstration shows that a 54 m3 QSCR room can deliver power to small coil receivers in nearly any position with 40% to 95% efficiency. Finally, a detailed safety analysis shows that up to 1900 watts can be transmitted to a coil receiver enabling safe and ubiquitous wireless power."</em> <a href="https://www.disneyresearch.com/publication/quasistatic-cavity-resonance-for-ubiquitous-wireless-power-transfer/">[...]</a></p>

It's a demonstration that it is very important to consider forces and material properties already when designing a mechanical object. Hints about proper design are presented in my video: https://youtu.be/mziT7KV-fRI . The video also includes explanations how to assemble this vise. For 3d-printing it's recommended to print 3 shell layers. 35% infill is sufficient. All the forces for clamping a workpiece are only active at the outer surface - more infill doesn't make the vise more robust. Layer height is 0.15 mm (maybe screws are better printed with 0.1mm layers). No support material needed.

Yes, the key factor is the Spartan-6 Field Programmable Gate Array by Xilinx, that is able to execute programs at very high speed, thanks to its parallel processing capability (multi-thread); the model that has been used in the project was chosen because it represents the most performing FPGA available on the market as a TQFP package, therefore it may still be soldered by means of the traditional tools.

This project allows the user to control the Master Volume of the Windows PC using any Remote (TV, Set-Top Box, Home Theater, etc.). The heart of the project is Arduino Uno. There are 2 most common Data Formats for IR – RC5 Coding and NEC Coding. The RC5 standard uses a bi-phase coding the carrier frequency fixed at 36 kHz. The transmission of a data word begins with two start bits followed by a toggle bit. The toggle bit changes its value at each new key-press. The five address bits represent the address of the device to be controlled. The six command bits contain the information to be transmitted. Each bit in the data word consists of half a bit period with no transmission and half a bit period with a burst of 32 pulses at 36 kHz. The most suitable IR receivers for receiving the RC5 code are those with the “AGC2” setting and a band-pass frequency of 36 kHz. Some examples are: TSOP1236, TSOP4836, TSOP34836, TSOP39236 and TSOP36236."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Based-Windows-PC-Volume-Remote-Control/">[...]</a></p>

This project makes use of coded IR emissions from a Sony TV remote, and a PICAXE microcontroller to manage the operation of a stepper motor. However, the same principles could be used for the control of AC or DC motors, relays, buzzers, lights, or almost any electrical or electro-mechanical device."</em> <a href="https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/projects/controlling-a-stepper-motor-with-an-sirc-tv-remote-and-a-picaxe-infrared/">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="http://www.envox.hr/eez/bench-power-supply/psu-introduction.html">Programmable bench power supply</a></h2>

<p><em>"The programmable bench power supply project was an attempt to create reliable, modular, open and programmable power supply. It’s also replicable at home and can be used for various tasks starting with powering breadboard, charge (or to some extent discharge) batteries of various types and sizes or use as a tool in school/educational and science experiments. It can be even used as a building block in the Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) environment. Here and in accompanying articles and documents a shorter form PSU (from Power Supply Unit) will be used for the sake of simplicity. Building a power supply is a popular between electronic hobbyists and DIYers that wants to get some experience and it’s often chosen or recommended as the first project that one should made. That is logical since in principle it’s very simple and also represents important electronic benchtop instrument. In general such designs is very simple and they are openly shared and discussed on various sites on the Internet. There is also many commercial devices that comes from many sides, different capabilities and feature lists. They promises a long term reliability, precision, support, etc. Their design could be very complex and difficult to replicate because and can include many trade secrets that made some manufacturers famous."</em> <a href="http://www.envox.hr/eez/bench-power-supply/psu-introduction.html">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-install-an-attiny-bootloader-with-virtual-usb">How to Install an ATtiny Bootloader With Virtual USB</a></h2>

<p><em>"In this tutorial, we’ll show you how to use Arduino to install the micronucleus bootloader, which has V-USB, onto an ATtiny84. These steps will work for other ATtiny chips, but you’ll need to change things like the pins_arduino.h file and target parameters in avrdude. By following this guide, you will be able to upload Arduino sketches directly to the ATtiny84 over USB without needing to use a programming device (such as another Arduino or FTDI chip). The Atmel AVR ATtiny84 is very similar to the ATtiny85 but with a few more I/O pins (six more, to be exact). If you like working with very small, inexpensive microcontrollers, the ATtiny84 and lower-power ATtiny84A are good options. Either the ATtiny84 or ATtiny84A will work for this tutorial."</em> <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-install-an-attiny-bootloader-with-virtual-usb">[...]</a></p>
