<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia a 1889 em Kiev <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Sikorsky">Igor Sikorsky</a>. Este pioneiro da aviação foi responsável pelo desenvolvimento dos helicópteros e dos aviões de asa fixa. O seu nome é ainda hoje associado a esta industria tendo ficado na história por ter conseguido fazer a primeira produção em massa de helicópteros. Sikorsky decidiu-se por um projecto de rotor simples, único, o VS-300, que acabou por ser o primeiro projecto de helicópteros de rotor único de elevação. Depois de experimentar as configurações para neutralizar o torque produzido pelo único rotor principal, Sikorsky estabeleceu um único rotor menor montado na lança da cauda.
Faz hoje anos também que nascia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cocke">John Cocke</a>. Este engenheiro informático norte-americano nascido em 1925 ficou conhecido na história pelo desenvolvimento de arquitecturas do computador e pela optimização do desenho de compiladores. Ele é considerado por muitos como "o pai da arquitectura RISC. É igualmente conhecido pelo algoritmo CYK. Este é um algoritmo usado em informática para a análise em gramáticas livres de contexto. Emprega análise "bottom-up" e programação dinâmica.
Faz hoje anos também <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Steinberger">Jack Steinberger</a>. É um físico de origem alemã que, juntamente com Leon Lederman e Melvin Schwartz, recebeu o Prémio Nobel de Física de 1988 pela descoberta do neutrino de múon.
Faz hoje anos igualmente <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieter_Zeeman">Pieter Zeeman</a>. Este físico holandês, juntamente com Hendrik Lorentz descobriram o efeito de Zeeman. É o efeito de dividir uma linha espectral em vários componentes na presença de um campo magnético estático. É análogo ao efeito Stark, a divisão de uma linha espectral em vários componentes na presença de um campo eléctrico. Similarmente ao efeito Stark, as transições entre diferentes componentes têm, em geral, diferentes intensidades, algumas sendo inteiramente proibidas (na aproximação de dipolo), conforme regido pelas regras de selecção.</p>

<p>Esta semana ficámos a saber que o Dubai vai ter, já este mês um robô policia sendo objectivo destes robôs serem cerca de 25% da força policial até 2030.
Uma equipe de investigadores do MIT projectou um fato de treino respirável com abas de ventilação que se abrem e fecham em resposta ao calor e suor do corpo do atleta. Estas abas, que variam de tamanho, são revestidas com células vivas que encolhem e expandem em resposta às mudanças na humidade.
Esta semana o campeão chinês de Go, Ke Jie sofreu duas derrotas contra o AlphaGo. Trata-se de um feito notável ter uma maquina a derrotar o campeão humano de um dos jogos mais complexos que existe.</p>

<h2><a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/moisture-responsive-workout-suit-0519">Researchers design moisture-responsive workout suit</a></h2>

<p><em>"A team of MIT researchers has designed a breathable workout suit with ventilating flaps that open and close in response to an athlete’s body heat and sweat. These flaps, which range from thumbnail- to finger-sized, are lined with live microbial cells that shrink and expand in response to changes in humidity. The cells act as tiny sensors and actuators, driving the flaps to open when an athlete works up a sweat, and pulling them closed when the body has cooled off. The researchers have also fashioned a running shoe with an inner layer of similar cell-lined flaps to air out and wick away moisture. Details of both designs are published today in Science Advances. Why use live cells in responsive fabrics? The researchers say that moisture-sensitive cells require no additional elements to sense and respond to humidity. The microbial cells they have used are also proven to be safe to touch and even consume. What’s more, with new genetic engineering tools available today, cells can be prepared quickly and in vast quantities, to express multiple functionalities in addition to moisture response. To demonstrate this last point, the researchers engineered moisture-sensitive cells to not only pull flaps open but also light up in response to humid conditions."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/moisture-responsive-workout-suit-0519">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Two days ago in the Zhejiang Province of China, Google's Go-playing artificial intelligence AlphaGo bested current world Go champion Ke Jie in the first game of a three-part match, sliding by on a half-point victory. Now the second game has taken place -- and once again, AlphaGo has emerged the winner. The human gave it his all. "Incredible," wrote DeepMind founder and CEO Demis Hassabis on Twitter while the match was underway. "According to #AlphaGo evaluations Ke Jie is playing perfectly at the moment." The match took place over a year after AlphaGo bested Lee Sedol, one of the world's top Go players, in four out of five matches in March 2016. It also beat European champion Fan Hui 5-0 in October 2015. Hassabis announced the win against Ke on Twitter. "AlphaGo wins game 2," he said. "What an amazing and complex game! Ke Jie pushed AlphaGo right to the limit." Ke said after Tuesday's match that the AI's improvement was palpable, saying that it now plays "like a god of Go." Perhaps it's time for AlphaGo to go head-to-head against another of its own kind."</em> <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/google-ai-alphago-wins-again-leaves-humans-in-the-dust/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/camera-equipped-drones-cinematography-0518">Cinematography on the fly</a></h2>

<p><em>"n recent years, a host of Hollywood blockbusters — including “The Fast and the Furious 7,” “Jurassic World,” and “The Wolf of Wall Street” — have included aerial tracking shots provided by drone helicopters outfitted with cameras. Those shots required separate operators for the drones and the cameras, and careful planning to avoid collisions. But a team of researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and ETH Zurich hope to make drone cinematography more accessible, simple, and reliable. At the International Conference on Robotics and Automation later this month, the researchers will present a system that allows a director to specify a shot’s framing — which figures or faces appear where, at what distance. Then, on the fly, it generates control signals for a camera-equipped autonomous drone, which preserve that framing as the actors move. As long as the drone’s information about its environment is accurate, the system also guarantees that it won’t collide with either stationary or moving obstacles."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/camera-equipped-drones-cinematography-0518">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://news.yale.edu/2017/05/17/building-better-bot-artificial-intelligence-helps-human-groups">Building a better ‘bot’: artificial intelligence helps human groups</a></h2>

<p><em>"Artificial intelligence doesn’t have to be super-sophisticated to make a difference in people’s lives, according to a new Yale University study. Even “dumb AI” can help human groups. In a series of experiments using teams of human players and robotic AI players, the inclusion of “bots” boosted the performance of human groups and the individual players, researchers found. The study appears in the May 18 edition of the journal Nature. “Much of the current conversation about artificial intelligence has to do with whether AI is a substitute for human beings. We believe the conversation should be about AI as a complement to human beings,” said Nicholas Christakis, co-director of the Yale Institute for Network Science (YINS) and senior author of the study. Christakis is a professor of sociology, ecology &amp; evolutionary biology, biomedical engineering, and medicine at Yale. The study adds to a growing body of Yale research into the complex dynamics of human social networks and how those networks influence everything from economic inequality to group violence. In this case, Christakis and first author Hirokazu Shirado conducted an experiment involving an online game that required groups of people to coordinate their actions for a collective goal. The human players also interacted with anonymous bots that were programmed with three levels of behavioral randomness — meaning the AI bots sometimes deliberately made mistakes. In addition, sometimes the bots were placed in different parts of the social network. More than 4,000 people participated in the experiment, which used a Yale-developed software called breadboard."</em> <a href="http://news.yale.edu/2017/05/17/building-better-bot-artificial-intelligence-helps-human-groups">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Dynamic 3D modeling like this could help urban planners design smarter and more livable cities. The city of Zurich, Switzerland has been reconstructed in 3D using millions of images and videos. Developed by researchers at ETH Zurich, the Varcity platform pulls from huge volumes of image data and uses algorithms to automatically stitch it all together. There are millions of images of every major city in the world, many of which are shared openly online. The ETH Zurich team realized they could collect this image data — from standard photos captured by tourists to videos streamed through public webcams and use triangulation to replicate regions in detail. “We combined all sources to provide a complete view of a city,” Hayko Riemenschneider, Varcity project manager, told Digital Trends. “The more data we have of an area, the more precise our models get.”"</em> <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/zurich-image-data-var-city/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.imec-int.com/en/articles/imec-demonstrates-self-learning-neuromorphic-chip-that-composes-music">Imec demonstrates self-learning neuromorphic chip that composes music</a></h2>

<p><em>"Today, at the imec technology forum (ITF2017), imec, the world-leading research and innovation hub in nano-electronics and digital technologies, demonstrated the world’s first self-learning neuromorphic chip. The brain-inspired chip, based on OxRAM technology, has the capability of self-learning and has been demonstrated to have the ability to compose music. The human brain is a dream for computer scientists: it has a huge computing power while consuming only a few tens of Watts. Imec researchers are combining state-of-the-art hardware and software to design chips that feature these desirable characteristics of a self-learning system. Imec’s ultimate goal is to design the process technology and building blocks to make artificial intelligence to be energy efficient so that that it can be integrated into sensors. Such intelligent sensors will drive the internet of things forward. This would not only allow machine learning to be present in all sensors but also allow on-field learning capability to further improve the learning. By co-optimizing the hardware and the software, the chip features machine learning and intelligence characteristics on a small area, while consuming only very little power. The chip is self-learning, meaning that is makes associations between what it has experienced and what it experiences. The more it experiences, the stronger the connections will be. The chip presented today has learned to compose new music and the rules for the composition are learnt on the fly."</em> <a href="https://www.imec-int.com/en/articles/imec-demonstrates-self-learning-neuromorphic-chip-that-composes-music">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/quantum-reservoir-for-microwaves/">Quantum reservoir for microwaves</a></h2>

<p><em>"In a recent experiment at EPFL, a microwave resonator, a circuit that supports electric signals oscillating at a resonance frequency, is coupled to the vibrations of a metallic micro-drum. By actively cooling the mechanical motion close to the lowest energy allowed by quantum mechanics, the micro-drum can be turned into a quantum reservoir – an environment that can shape the states of the microwaves. The findings are published as an advanced publication in Nature Physics. László Dániel Tóth, Nathan Bernier, and Dr Alexey Feofanov led the research effort in Tobias Kippenberg’s Laboratory of Photonics and Quantum Measurements at EPFL, with support from Dr Andreas Nunnenkamp, a theorist at the University of Cambridge, UK. Microwaves are electromagnetic waves, just like visible light, but with a frequency that is four orders of magnitude smaller. Microwaves form the backbone of several everyday technologies, from microwave ovens and cellular phones to satellite communication, and have recently gained further importance in manipulating quantum information in superconducting circuits — one of the most promising candidates to realize future quantum computers. The micro-drum, only 30 microns in diameter, 100 nanometers thick and fabricated in the Center of MicroNanotechnology (CMi) at EPFL, constitutes the top plate of a capacitor in a superconducting microwave resonator. The drum’s position modulates the resonator’s resonance frequency and, conversely, a voltage across the capacitor exerts a force on the micro-drum. Through this bidirectional interaction, energy can be exchanged between mechanical vibrations and the microwave oscillations in the superconducting circuit."</em> <a href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/quantum-reservoir-for-microwaves/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/news/press-services/press-releases/2017/liedl_goldparticles.html">Saving energy with a spot of silver</a></h2>

<p><em>"Tomorrow’s computers will run on light, and gold nanoparticle chains show much promise as light conductors. Now LMU scientists have demonstrated how tiny spots of silver could markedly reduce energy consumption in light-based computation. Today’s computers are faster and smaller than ever before. The latest generation of transistors will have structural features with dimensions of only 10 nanometers. If computers are to become even faster and at the same time more energy efficient at these minuscule scales, they will probably need to process information using light particles instead of electrons. This is referred to as “optical computing”. Fiber-optic networks already use light to transport data over long distances at high speed and with minimum loss. The diameters of the thinnest cables, however, are in the micrometer range, as the light waves -- with a wavelength of around one micrometer -- must be able to oscillate unhindered. In order to process data on a micro- or even nanochip, an entirely new system is therefore required. One possibility would be to conduct light signals via so-called plasmon oscillations. This involves a light particle (photon) exciting the electron cloud of a gold nanoparticle so that it starts oscillating. These waves then travel along a chain of nanoparticles at approximately 10% of the speed of light. This approach achieves two goals: nanometer-scale dimensions and enormous speed. What remains, however, is the energy consumption. In a chain composed purely of gold, this would be almost as high as in conventional transistors, due to the considerable heat development in the gold particles."</em> <a href="https://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/news/press-services/press-releases/2017/liedl_goldparticles.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/news/newsarchiv/2017/kling_dielectric.html">Turmoil in sluggish electrons’ existence</a></h2>

<p><em>"An international team of physicists has monitored the scattering behavior of electrons in a non-conducting material in real-time. Their insights could be beneficial for radiotherapy. We can refer to electrons in non-conducting materials as ‘sluggish’. Typically, they remain fixed in a location, deep inside an atomic composite. It is hence relatively still in a dielectric crystal lattice. This idyll has now been heavily shaken up by a team of physicists led by Matthias Kling, the leader of the Ultrafast Nanophotonics group in the Department of Physics at LMU, and various research institutions, including the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics (MPQ), the Institute of Photonics and Nanotechnologies (IFN-CNR) in Milan, the Institute of Physics at the University of Rostock, the Max Born Institute (MBI), the Center for Free-Electron Laser Science (CFEL) and the University of Hamburg. For the first time, these researchers managed to directly observe the interaction of light and electrons in a dielectric, a non-conducting material, on timescales of attoseconds (billionths of a billionth of a second). The study was published in the latest issue of the journal Nature Physics. The scientists beamed light flashes lasting only a few hundred attoseconds onto 50 nanometer thick glass particles, which released electrons inside the material. Simultaneously, they irradiated the glass particles with an intense light field, which interacted with the electrons for a few femtoseconds (millionths of a billionth of a second), causing them to oscillate. This resulted, generally, in two different reactions by the electrons. First, they started to move, then collided with atoms within the particle, either elastically or inelastically. Because of the dense crystal lattice, the electrons could move freely between each of the interactions for only a few ångstrom (10-10 meter). “Analogous to billiard, the energy of electrons is conserved in an elastic collision, while their direction can change. For inelastic collisions, atoms are excited and part of the kinetic energy is lost. In our experiments, this energy loss leads to a depletion of the electron signal that we can measure,” explains Professor Francesca Calegari (CNR-IFN Milan and CFEL/University of Hamburg)."</em> <a href="http://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/news/newsarchiv/2017/kling_dielectric.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Since the discovery two decades ago of the unconventional topological superconductor Sr2RuO4, scientists have extensively investigated its properties at temperatures below its 1°K critical temperature (Tc), at which a phase transition from a metal to superconducting state occurs. Now experiments done at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the Madhavan and Abbamonte laboratories, in collaboration with researchers at six institutions in the U.S., Canada, United Kingdom, and Japan, have shed new light on the electronic properties of this material at temperatures 4°K above Tc. The team’s findings may elucidate yet-unresolved questions about Sr2RuO4’s emergent properties in the superconducting state. Vidya Madhavan, a physics professor and member of the Frederick Seitz Materials Research Lab at the U. of I., led the experiment. She explains, “We began from the widely held assumption that, in Sr2RO4’s normal metallic state above its Tc, the interactions of electrons would be sufficiently weak, so that the spectrum of excitations or electronic states would be well defined.” Madhavan continues, “However, and this is a big surprise, our team observed large interaction effects in the normal metallic state. Electrons in metals have well defined momentum and energy. In simple metals, at low temperatures the electrons occupy all momentum states in a region bounded by a ‘Fermi surface.’ Here we found that the velocity of electrons in some directions across the Fermi surface were reduced by about 50 percent, which is not expected. We saw similar interaction effects in the tunneling density of the states. This is a significant reduction, and it was a great surprise. We thought we would just find the shape of the Fermi surface, but instead, we get these anomalies.” Eduardo Fradkin, a physics professor and the director of the Institute for Condensed Matter Theory at the U. of I., comments, “The basic electronic properties of this material have been known for some time. Scientists study this material because it’s supposed to be a simple system for testing scientific effects. But the material has also been a source of ongoing debate in the field: this is a p-wave superconductor, with spin-triplet pairing. This has suggested that the superconducting state may be topological in nature. Understanding how this system becomes superconducting is an open and intriguing question.”"</em> <a href="https://mrl.illinois.edu/news/new-understanding-superconductor%E2%80%99s-normal-state-may-open-way-solving-longstanding-puzzle">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/scientists-construct-a-stable-one-dimensional-metallic-material">Scientists construct a stable one-dimensional metallic material</a></h2>

<p><em>"The researchers, from the Universities of Cambridge and Warwick, have developed a wire made from a single string of tellurium atoms, making it a true one-dimensional material. These one-dimensional wires are produced inside extremely thin carbon nanotubes (CNTs) – hollow cylinders made of carbon atoms. The finished ‘extreme nanowires’ are less than a billionth of a metre in diameter – 10,000 times thinner than a human hair. A single string of atoms is as small as materials based on elements in the periodic table can get, making them potentially useful for semiconductors and other electronic applications. However, these strings can be unstable, as their atoms are constantly vibrating and, in the absence of a physical constraint, they can end up morphing into some other structure or disintegrating entirely. According to the Cambridge researchers, encapsulating the nanowires is not only a useful method of making stable one-dimensional (1D) materials, it may be necessary to prevent them from disintegrating. The researchers have also shown that it is possible to alter the shape and electronic behaviour of the nanowires by varying the diameters of the tubes which encapsulate them. Their results are reported in the journal ACS Nano. To make electronics faster and more powerful, more transistors need to be squeezed onto semiconductor chips. For the past 50 years, the number of transistors on a single chip has doubled every two years – this is known as Moore’s law. However, we are getting close to the limit of how small a transistor can be before quantum effects associated with individual atoms and electrons start to interfere with its normal operation. Researchers are currently investigating various ways of keeping up with Moore’s law, and in turn keeping up with our desire for faster, cheaper and more powerful electronics. One-dimensional materials could be one of the solutions to the challenge of miniaturisation. The Cambridge researchers first used computer simulations to predict the types of geometric structures that would form if tellurium atoms were injected into nanotubes, and found that 1D wires could exist in such a scenario. Later, lab-based tests, using the most advanced techniques for the synthesis and atomic-resolution visualisation of such extreme materials, were performed by the Warwick researchers to confirm the theoretical predictions. Not only were the researchers able to successfully ‘build’ stable 1D wires, but they found that changing the diameter of the nanotubes lead to changes in the properties of tellurium. Tellurium normally behaves as a semiconductor, but when injected into carbon nanotubes and confined to one dimension, it starts behaving like a metal. Additionally, while the confinement provided by the CNTs can induce drastic changes in the way that tellurium behaves, the nanotubes themselves do not interact in any other way with the tellurium nanowires."</em> <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/scientists-construct-a-stable-one-dimensional-metallic-material">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The process that makes gold-plated jewelry or chrome car accents is now making powerful lithium-ion batteries. Researchers at the University of Illinois, Xerion Advanced Battery Corporation and Nanjing University in China developed a method for electroplating lithium-ion battery cathodes, yielding high-quality, high-performance battery materials that could also open the door to flexible and solid-state batteries. “This is an entirely new approach to manufacturing battery cathodes, which resulted in batteries with previously unobtainable forms and functionalities,” said Paul V. Braun, a professor of materials science and engineering and director of the Frederick Seitz Materials Research Lab at Illinois. He co-led the research group that published its findings in the journal Science Advances. Traditional lithium-ion battery cathodes use lithium-containing powders formed at high temperatures. The powder is mixed with gluelike binders and other additives into a slurry, which is spread on a thin sheet of aluminum foil and dried. The slurry layer needs to be thin, so the batteries are limited in how much energy they can store. The glue also limits performance."</em> <a href="https://illinois.edu/blog/view/6367/500138">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A team at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB) has for the first time fabricated a nanomaterial made from nanoparticles of a titanium oxide compound (Ti4O7) that is characterised by an extremely large surface area, and tested it as a cathode material in lithium-sulphur batteries. The highly porous nanomaterial possesses high storage capacity that remains nearly constant over many charging cycles. At present, lithium batteries are one of the best solutions for storing electrical power in a small space. Lithium ions in these batteries migrate from the anode to the opposite electrical pole, the cathode, during the discharge cycle. The anode and cathode generally consist of heavy-metal compounds that are expensive and toxic. One interesting alternative is the lithium-sulphur battery. In this case, the cathode does not consist of heavy metals, but instead of sulphur – an economical and widely available material. As lithium ions migrate to the cathode during the discharge cycle, a reaction takes place there that forms lithium sulphide (Li2S) via various intermediate lithium polysulfides. During cycling, dissolution of lithium polysulfides causes the battery’s capacity to decline over the course of multiple charging cycles via the so-called “shuttle effect”. For this reason, researchers the world over are working to improve cathode materials that would be able to chemically or physically confine or encapsulate polysulphides, such as with nanoparticles made of titanium dioxide (TiO2), for example."</em> <a href="http://www.helmholtz-berlin.de/pubbin/news_seite?nid=14669&amp;sprache=en&amp;typoid=49880">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Faster, more accurate and agile computation tools and methods have been developed through the SEMTEC project, led by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. This will enable the elimination of the expensive and time-consuming prototype phase in the electromechanical industry. Finnish industry will gain a competitive advantage due to the faster product development of electrical motors, generators and transformers, which will enter the markets at lower cost. The project will also result in quieter and more energy-efficient machines. The key result of the SEMTEC project is new computation methods, which can now be exploited by industry for the first time, using companies' own tools. The project produced innovative and accurate methods to control vibrations, dampen noise and improve the energy efficiency of devices. Beneficiaries of the results include the electromechanical industry in particular, which manufactures electric motors, generators and transformers. In addition, cooperation between research and industry will increase when all results are available to everyone via the open-source Elmer software. "Finnish industry will gain a competitive advantage from leaner design processes. Electromechanical devices are seldom mass-produced – each product unit tends to be separately designed. Accelerating product development will therefore markedly shorten delivery times and create a major competitive edge," says project manager Janne Keränen of VTT. For example, the noise generated by lifts and transformers will be reduced.

Computer architects at Microsoft Research say the company has formalized a goal of having an operational storage system based on DNA working inside a data center toward the end of this decade. The aim is a “proto-commercial system in three years storing some amount of data on DNA in one of our data centers, for at least a boutique application,” says Doug Carmean, a partner architect at Microsoft Research. He describes the eventual device as the size of a large, 1970s-era Xerox copier. Internally, Microsoft harbors the even more ambitious goal of replacing tape drives, a common format used for archiving information. “We hope to get it branded as ‘Your Storage with DNA,’” says Carmean. The plans signal how seriously some tech companies are taking the seemingly strange idea of saving videos, photos, or valuable documents in the same molecule our genes are made of.

Modern vehicles are increasingly autonomous, relying on sensors to provide information to automatically control them. They are also equipped with internet access for safety or infotainment applications making them vulnerable to cyberattacks. This will only multiply as society transitions to self-driving autonomous vehicles in which hackers could gain control of the sensors, causing confusion, chaos and collisions. Although autonomous vehicles are essentially large computers on wheels, securing them is not the same as securing a communication network that connects desktop computers and smartphones to large geographical areas due to the roles that the sensors and actuators play in the physical layer of the network. Working in the Texas A&amp;M’s Cyberphysical Systems Laboratory, Dr. P.R.Kumar, University Distinguished Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, along with graduate students Bharadwaj Satchidanandan and Woo-Hyun Ko, have applied the theory of dynamic watermarking of sensors in autonomous vehicles to prevent malicious attacks. In their research demonstrations, 10 cameras recorded the movement of the self-driving prototype vehicles. The vision sensors in the system received the images and accurately calculated the exact location and orientation of the vehicles.

<p><em>"A KAIST research team presented a hybrid animal-robot interaction called “the parasitic robot system,” that imitates the nature relationship between parasites and host. The research team led by Professor Phil-Seung Lee of the Department of Mechanical Engineering took an animal’s locomotive abilities to apply the theory of using a robot as a parasite. The robot is attached to its host animal in a way similar to an actual parasite, and it interacts with the host through particular devices and algorithms. Even with remarkable technology advancements, robots that operate in complex and harsh environments still have some serious limitations in moving and recharging. However, millions of years of evolution have led to there being many real animals capable of excellent locomotion and survive in actual natural environment. Certain kinds of real parasites can manipulate the behavior of the host to increase the probability of its own reproduction. Similarly, in the proposed concept of a “parasitic robot,” a specific behavior is induced by the parasitic robot in its host to benefit the robot. The team chose a turtle as their first host animal and designed a parasitic robot that can perform “stimulus-response training.”  The parasitic robot, which is attached to the turtle, can induce the turtle’s object-tracking behavior through repeated training sessions. The robot then simply guides it using LEDs and feeds it snacks as a reward for going in the right direction through a programmed algorithm. After training sessions lasting five weeks, the parasitic robot can successfully control the direction of movement of the host turtles in the waypoint navigation task in a water tank. This hybrid animal–robot interaction system could provide an alternative solution of the limitations of conventional mobile robot systems in various fields. Ph.D. candidate Dae-Gun Kim, the first author of this research said that there are a wide variety of animals including mice, birds, and fish that could perform equally as well at such tasks. He said that in the future, this system will be applied to various exploration and reconnaissance missions that humans and robots find it difficult to do on their own."</em> <a href="http://www.kaist.ac.kr/_prog/_board/?mode=V&amp;no=64441&amp;code=ed_news&amp;site_dvs_cd=en&amp;menu_dvs_cd=0601&amp;list_typ=B&amp;skey=&amp;sval=&amp;smonth=&amp;site_dvs=&amp;GotoPage=">[...]</a>

They describe their shape-morphing creations as not only culinary performance art, but also a practical way to reduce food-shipping costs. For instance, the edible films could be stacked together and shipped to consumers, then morph into their final shape later, when immersed in water."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/researchers-engineer-shape-shifting-noodles-0525">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.vttresearch.com/media/news/vtts-autonomous-cars-take-to-public-roads-and-start-communicating-with-each-other">VTT's autonomous cars take to public roads and start communicating with each other</a></h2>

<p><em>"Marilyn, the first automated car to be granted a road traffic testing permit in Finland, and its spouse Martti have taken things to a new level together and started exchanging information with each other and their driving environment. They will take the next step in their relationship in the autumn, when the public digital infrastructure can also talk with the couple. The automated cars developed by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland can hear, see and sense, and Finnish intelligence hums in their brains. They are able to follow a pre-programmed route and avoid collisions with sudden obstacles without input from the driver. The cars currently require the lane markings or sides of the road to be visible. This is, however, only the first step; by 2020, the cars will be driving in more demanding conditions on roads covered in gravel and snow. "Our cars already have enough equipment required for automated driving, and now we are taking the most out of them with software technology. The challenges range from small to big ones, but that's fascinating," says project manager Matti Kutila from VTT. The autonomous cars feature a thermal camera for observing people and animals; a stereo camera and radar for high-resolution scanning of the vicinity; laser scanners and long-range radars for seeing farther; and GPS/Glonass receivers for positioning. The cars also have inertia units for determining direction and accelerations. The actuators are cylinders and motors. The sensors and actuators are connected by intelligence that creates a situational awareness and controls the actuators so that the car moves as planned at an accuracy of milliseconds and centimetres."</em> <a href="http://www.vttresearch.com/media/news/vtts-autonomous-cars-take-to-public-roads-and-start-communicating-with-each-other">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Ambient-Light-Alarm/">DIY Ambient Light Alarm</a></h2>

<p><em>"The idea ofthis project is to create an alarm that wakes via ambient light. In itself, this isn’t terribly hard. All you need is some LEDs, a clock and a microcontroller of some kind. Wire it all up, write some code and you’re done. I believe there are already numerous tutorials on how to do something like this. It’s been done many times before and honestly, isn’t very interesting. Thankfully, I decided to make this alarm as a birthday present for my girlfriend who despises anything tec. Apparently, wires are ugly and analog is the way to go. So here is the aim: take some LEDs, a clock and a microcontroller of some kind, wire it all up, write some code for it, and then hide it in a wooden shell to make it look nice and analog. Inspiration for this project is the "DIY Heng Lamp" by JustAddSharks. I love the idea of using floating corks in the middle of a round lamp as a switch to turn the light on and off. This is a perfect concept on how to activate the alarm and how to turn it off again once I’m awake. With the activation switch taken care off, the next step is to find some nice way to set the time at which I want to be woken. Moving away from the Heng Lamp, I decided to make the alarm circular and use two disks to set the hour and minute. This means that the ‘device’ will not actually be able to tell the current time. Considering that I’m building an alarm and not a clock, I think that’s okay. So here is how the alarm works. Set the time at which you want to be woken using the hour and minute disk (similar to a real clock, the set hour and minute are at the top, at the twelve o’ clock location). Connect the two corks in the middle and to activate the alarm. The LED’s in the back will slowly start turning on 15 minutes before the set time. Once the time at which you want to be woken has been reached, the LED’s will have reached maximum brightness and a small piezo speaker will start making some noise. Disconnect the corks in the middle at any point to turn the alarm off."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Ambient-Light-Alarm/">[...]</a>

The key design points of Dextra are: adaptive grip, compact size, mechanical simplicity and ease of replication. The main element of Dextra is the finger module. The hand is modular: the four fingers are interchangeable, and the thumb is a variation of the finger module. The finger module comprises the printable mechanical finger, the actuator and an encoder. The compact actuator uses a DC micro gearmotor to rotate a spool that winds a fishing line, converting the rotational motion of the motor into a linear motion. The position of each finger module is controlled by a PID loop that uses the value provided by the magnetic encoder of the DC motor as the feedback signal. To be controlled by an amputee, Dextra uses a EMG interface that uses the user's myoelectric signals as the high-level control input."</em> <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/9890-dextra">[...]</a>

So, I recruited a micro-controllers and suite of sensors to help with this tasks. Watering is the most important cultural practice and most labour intensive task in daily gardening operation. Watering systems ease the burden of getting water to plants when they need it. Knowing when and how much to water is two important aspects of watering process. To make the gardener works easy, the automatic plant watering system is created. Smart Garden is a plant environmental monitoring system. It monitors the soil moisture, air temperature, and air humidity of your plant(s) and automatically waters the plant based on the data received by sensors. Other than that functionalities like Artificial Sunlight and Camera to keep view on plants can also be added. Thing-speak and Blynk application is used to view those sensor data from remote location.

I had several ESP8266 modules in house, and this was a project I could use them. I first made a test on my desk. Where I tried to let the ESP’s talk to each other. When that worked I added an annoying sound. To prevent my son from ignoring the message. There are several messages to send. The sender get a delivered message, so we can see if the message is arrived. When my son disables the annoying beep, the sender module gets a message. This message tells us that my son has turned off the sound. Which means that he is on his way downstairs. I intended to use two LCD 1602 displays. Somehow I was not able to get the second ESP8266 module control the display using I2C. Changing each component with the other ESP8266 module learned me that all devices were working fine. But not in this config. So for the receiver I attached an I2C Oled display. This did work as expected. After that I made two different housing to put the hardware in. The tiny Oled display is fragile. So I placed a transparent cover before the front of the housing.

I threw in an additional temperature sensor and added a small solar panel to keep the device running autonomously. The Photon firmware boots the device every 5 minutes and takes a series of measurements during one minute: pH, ORP, temperature, battery charge and WiFi strength. The average of each measurement is sent as an event to the Particle cloud where an integration made by Particle takes care of forwarding those events to the Google pub/sub service. On the Google cloud platform, I have a cloud function that stores the value in a datastore. I'm now building the webapp to visualize the measurements online.... to be continued!

I agreed to create glasses with an LED that can cycle at 40Hz to help administer the light therapy to people as they walk, so that they do not have to stand in a test room to receive the therapy. Later a standalone room lamp that is capable of administering the therapy was also created and a remote with an OLED screen was also added to help the user control the two devices. In addition to the two devices being controllable via the remote, they can also be controlled through a phone or computer with wireless capabilities. The project uses ESP8266 12-E modules to achieve the wireless communication between the 3 core devices and since communication is achieved via Wi-Fi access points, they can also be connected to with a normal computer.

<p><em>"Signal degradation is unavoidable, but various ICs, such as the DS250DF210, can help to restore what has been lost (or eliminate what has been added). Electrical signals are never really “pure”. Noise is pervasive in every portion of an electronic circuit. Indeed, noise has affected your signal before it ever shows up at an IC’s output pin. And in addition to noise, we have the endless supply of parasitic resistances, capacitances, and inductances that cause a signal to deviate from the idealized version. However, there is no doubt that certain situations make a particularly generous contribution to signal degradation. The situation that we’re focusing on in this article is long-distance interconnection. Signals are often relatively safe when they’re contained within a well-designed PCB, but interconnection between separate PCBs or separate subsystems is a different story."</em> <a href="https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/coping-with-long-distance-serial-communication-a-new-retimer-ic-from-texas/">[...]</a>

The main reason is that stepper motors are precise and have no performance loss when the battery voltage drops. One pulse is always an exact amount of motion. Regular DC motors can have mechanical friction and electric resistance differences. This can cause performance differences. As a result the robot will not move in a straight line.
