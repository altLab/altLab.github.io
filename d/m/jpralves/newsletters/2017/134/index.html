<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1837, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Diderik_van_der_Waals">Johannes Diderik van der Waals</a>. Este físico holandês ficou conhecido pela sua pesquisa sobre os estados gasosos e líquidos da matéria. O seu principal trabalho foi desenvolver uma equação (a equação van der Waals) que - ao contrário das leis de Charles Boyle e Jacques Charles - aplica-se a gases reais. Uma vez que as moléculas têm forças de atracção e volume (por mais pequeno que seja), van der Waals introduziu na teoria duas constantes adicionais para levar em consideração essas propriedades. As fracas forças electrostáticas atractivas entre moléculas e entre átomos são chamadas de forças van der Waals em sua homenagem. Seus valiosos resultados permitiram que James Dewar e Heike Kamerlingh-Onnes estudassem os métodos de liquidificar os gases permanentes. Foi-lhe atribuído o prémio Nobel da Física em 1910.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1869, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valdemar_Poulsen">Valdemar Poulsen</a>. Este engenheiro dinamarquês desenvolveu em 1903 o primeiro dispositivo para gerar ondas de rádio contínuas, contribuindo para o desenvolvimento da radiodifusão. O seu transmissor de arco aumentou a faixa de frequência de Duddell's Songing Arc (1900) da faixa de áudio para ondas de rádio, permitindo que a fala fosse transmitida até um raio de 240 km. Em 1920, o transmissor do arco de Poulsen era tão poderoso quanto 1000kW com faixas de até 4.000 km. Uma invenção anterior era o Telegrafono, para o qual ele submeteu uma patente na Dinamarca em 1 de Dezembro de 1898. Este foi o primeiro dispositivo na história a usar gravação de som magnético, embora esta invenção permaneça comercialmente impraticável devido à baixa saída de som até ao advento dos amplificadores de tubo de vácuo na década de 1930.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1874, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Lyman">Theodore Lyman</a>. Este físico norte-americano, fez estudos importantes em fenómenos relacionados com redes de difracção, nos comprimentos de onda da luz ultravioleta de vácuo descoberta por Victor Schumann e também nas propriedades da luz de um comprimento de onda extremamente curto, sobre o qual ele contribuiu com documentos valiosos para a literatura de física nos procedimentos das sociedades científicas.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1887, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Moseley">Henry Moseley</a>. Este físico britânico demonstrou experimentalmente que as principais propriedades de um elemento são determinadas pelo número atómico, não pelo peso atómico, e estabeleceu firmemente a relação entre o número atómico e a carga do núcleo atómico. Usando técnicas fotográficas de raio X, ele determinou uma relação matemática entre o comprimento de onda da radiação e os números atómicos dos elementos emissores. Moseley obteve várias relações quantitativas a partir das quais ele previu a existência de três elementos em falta (números 43, 61 e 75) na tabela periódica, todos os quais foram posteriormente identificados.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1894, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Deskey">Donald Deskey</a>. Este desenhador industrial norte-americano ajudou a estabelecer o design industrial como uma profissão. Ele criou o uso inventivo de materiais industriais para fins decorativos. Deskey inventou um laminado de alta pressão conhecido como Weldtex. Ele projectou as luzes de rua bem conhecidas na comissão para a cidade de Nova York em 1958 como um novo protótipo de padrão de luz de rua. Ele trouxe um olhar novo e modernista para móveis e interiores, incluindo o de Radio City Music Hall.</p>

<p>Esta semana ficámos a saber que a Tesla vai comercializar um camião eléctrico com autonomia de 800 Km. A bateria pode ter até 1 megawatt-hora de energia. E com um sistema de Tesla Megacharger mais novo, super-rápido, um camionista pode adicionar 600 Km de alcance em 30 minutos. O Tesla Semi entrará em produção em 2019, afirma a Tesla.</p>

<p>Também esta semana ficámos a saber que astrónomos observaram um asteróide intrigante que se deslocou através do sistema solar numa trajectória inclinada do espaço interestelar - o primeiro objecto confirmado vindo de outro sistema estelar. Agora, novos dados revelam que o intruso interestelar é um objecto rochoso em forma de charuto com uma tonalidade um pouco avermelhada. O asteróide, chamado 'Oumuamua pelos seus descobridores, tem até 400 metros de comprimento e altamente alongado. Tem uma relação de aspecto maior que a de qualquer asteróide ou cometa observado no nosso sistema solar até à data. Embora sua forma alongada seja bastante surpreendente e, ao contrário dos asteróides observados em nosso sistema solar, pode fornecer novas pistas sobre a forma como os outros sistemas solares se formaram.</p>

<p>Ainda esta semana, um robô chinês tornou-se a primeira máquina do mundo a passar pelo exame médico. O robô médico chinês de IA chamado "Xiaoyi" tornou-se o primeiro no mundo a ser aprovado na prova escrita do Exame Nacional de Licenciamento Médico da China, que agora trabalhará para melhorar o diagnóstico clínico. O robô obteve 456 pontos no exame, muito acima da média nacional, de acordo com sua equipa de pesquisa no Tsinghua-iFlyTek Joint Lab da Universidade de Tsinghua e a empresa líder na China iFlyTek Co., Ltd. Xiaoyi estudou quase um milhão de imagens médicas, 53 livros médicos, dois milhões de registos médicos e 400 mil literaturas médicas e relatórios médicos antes de tentar fazer o teste, disse Wu Ji, director do laboratório conjunto.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como um modelo 3D que poderá ser útil. São apresentadas as revistas newelectronics de 14 Novembro 2017, a revista HackSpace magazine #1 e a revista "AIY Voice Essentials".</p>

<p><em>"Astronomers recently scrambled to observe an intriguing asteroid that zipped through the solar system on a steep trajectory from interstellar space-the first confirmed object from another star. Now, new data reveal the interstellar interloper to be a rocky, cigar-shaped object with a somewhat reddish hue. The asteroid, named 'Oumuamua by its discoverers, is up to one-quarter mile (400 meters) long and highly-elongated-perhaps 10 times as long as it is wide. That aspect ratio is greater than that of any asteroid or comet observed in our solar system to date. While its elongated shape is quite surprising, and unlike asteroids seen in our solar system, it may provide new clues into how other solar systems formed. The observations and analyses were funded in part by NASA and appear in the Nov. 20 issue of the journal Nature."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7006">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.blog.chinadaily.com.cn/forum.php?mod=viewthread&amp;tid=1889623">Chinese robot becomes world’s first machine to pass medical exam</a></h2>

<p><em>"A Chinese AI medical robot named “Xiaoyi” became the world’s first to pass the written test of China’s National Medical Licensing Examination, who will now work to improve clinical diagnosis, Beijing News reported. The robot scored 456 points in the exam, well above the national average, according to its research team at the Tsinghua-iFlyTek Joint Lab of Tsinghua University and China’s leading AI enterprise iFlyTek Co., Ltd. Xiaoyi studied nearly one million medical images, 53 medical books, two million medical records, and 400,000 medical literatures and medical reports before sitting for the test, said Wu Ji, director of the joint lab. For the critics who say that the robot only works by relying on its formidable memory ability, Wu explained that it does not make sense, because medical examination questions vary every year. Wu said its study, reasoning, and judgment abilities also played a part in Xiaoyi’s success. However, the robot is not likely to replace human doctors, noted Tao Xiaodong, a project manager at iFlyTek, adding that the robot is not able to flexibly use the knowledge it possesses, as there are often unforeseen circumstances during actual diagnosis and treatment. The robot will be applied nationwide from March next year in medical education and training, and will be used to assist doctors in clinical diagnosis and treatment to improve diagnosis accuracy and shorten treatment time."</em> <a href="http://www.blog.chinadaily.com.cn/forum.php?mod=viewthread&amp;tid=1889623">[...]</a>

<p><em>"System with thousands of nodes brings affordable testbed to supercomputing system-software developers LOS ALAMOS, N.M., Nov. 13, 2017—A quest to help the systems software community work on very large supercomputers without having to actually test on them has spawned an affordable, scalable system using thousands of inexpensive Raspberry Pi nodes. It brings a powerful high-performance-computing testbed to system-software developers, researchers, and others who lack machine time on the world’s fastest supercomputers. “It’s not like you can keep a petascale machine around for R&amp;D work in scalable systems software,” said Gary Grider, leader of the High Performance Computing Division at Los Alamos National Laboratory, home of the Trinity supercomputer. “The Raspberry Pi modules let developers figure out how to write this software and get it to work reliably without having a dedicated testbed of the same size, which would cost a quarter billion dollars and use 25 megawatts of electricity.”  Grider conceived the new solution to provide the systems software community with an inexpensive testbed of similar scale to the largest supercomputers being deployed. Designed and built by BitScope and distributed by SICORP, the Pi Cluster Modules enable developers to build, scale and test software before launching it on Trinity, Crossroads, and other large systems. The modules have other potential applications from education to the internet of things."</em> <a href="http://www.lanl.gov/discover/news-release-archive/2017/November/1113-raspberry-pi.php">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A discovery by an international team of researchers from Princeton University, the Georgia Institute of Technology and Humboldt University in Berlin points the way to more widespread use of an advanced technology generally known as organic electronics. The research, published Nov. 13 in the journal Nature Materials, focuses on organic semiconductors, a class of materials prized for their applications in emerging technologies such as flexible electronics, solar energy conversion, and high-quality color displays for smartphones and televisions. In the short term, the advance should particularly help with organic light-emitting diodes that operate at high energy to emit colors such as green and blue. “Organic semiconductors are ideal materials for the fabrication of mechanically flexible devices with energy-saving low temperature processes,” said Xin Lin, a doctoral student and a member of the Princeton research team. “One of their major disadvantages has been their relatively poor electrical conductivity, which leads to inefficient devices with a shorter operating lifetime than is required for commercial applications. We are working to improve the electrical properties of organic semiconductors to make them available for more applications.” Semiconductors, typically made of silicon, are the foundation of modern electronics because engineers can take advantage of their unique properties to control electrical currents."</em> <a href="https://engineering.princeton.edu/news/2017/11/17/breakthrough-could-launch-organic-electronics-beyond-cell-phone-screens">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Machine learning could improve our ability to determine whether a new drug works in the brain, potentially enabling researchers to detect drug effects that would be missed entirely by conventional statistical tests, finds a new UCL study published today in Brain. “Current statistical models are too simple. They fail to capture complex biological variations across people, discarding them as mere noise. We suspected this could partly explain why so many drug trials work in simple animals but fail in the complex brains of humans. If so, machine learning capable of modelling the human brain in its full complexity may uncover treatment effects that would otherwise be missed,” said the study’s lead author, Dr Parashkev Nachev (UCL Institute of Neurology). To test the concept, the research team looked at large-scale data from patients with stroke, extracting the complex anatomical pattern of brain damage caused by the stroke in each patient, creating in the process the largest collection of anatomically registered images of stroke ever assembled."</em> <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/1117/151117-machine-learning-clinical-trials">[...]</a>

The Terzo Millenio aims to be self-healing and electric — concepts that today seem about as far-fetched as the hovercrafts in "Back to the Future II"’s imagining of 2015. However, in reality, this technology is as attainable as it is visionary."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/mit-and-lamborghini-developing-terzo-millenio-electric-car-of-the-future-1117">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.caltech.edu/news/microscopic-origin-efficiency-droop-leds-80436">The Microscopic Origin of Efficiency Droop in LEDs</a></h2>

<p><em>"Semiconductor study shows that the coupling between electrons and thermal vibrations may be sapping energy from LEDs Light-emitting diodes—or LEDs, as they are commonly known—have been slowly replacing incandescent light bulbs in applications ranging from car taillights to indicators on electronics since their invention in the 1960s. Eschewing the filament of an incandescent bulb and the mercury vapor of a fluorescent bulb, LEDs instead generate light by applying a voltage across a semiconductor. Electrons combine with holes (places in the crystalline structure where an electron could but does not exist, making them positively charged), leading to the emission of photons—particles of light. Most LEDs use semiconductors made from a material called gallium nitride (GaN). These GaN LEDs are reliable and safe, but have the disadvantage of quickly becoming inefficient as the voltage is scaled up, a phenomenon called "efficiency droop." "More than 10 percent of electricity generated in the U.S. is used for lighting in the commercial and residential sectors."</em> <a href="http://www.caltech.edu/news/microscopic-origin-efficiency-droop-leds-80436">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Imagine printing off a wristband that charges your smartphone or electric car with cheap supplies from a local hardware store. That’s the direction materials research is heading at Brunel University London where scientists have become the first to simply and affordably 3D print a flexible, wearable ‘battery’. The technique opens the way for novel designs for super-efficient, wearable power for phones, electric cars, medical implants like pacemakers and more. The printer squirts stacks of silicone, glue and gel electrolyte pastes like a layer cake, to make what looks like a clear festival wristband. Sandwiched inside is a supercapacitor, which stores energy like a battery, but on its surface and without chemical reactions. “This is the first time a flexible supercapacitor including all its components has been produced by 3D printing,” said Milad Areir at Brunel’s Cleaner Electronics Research Group."</em> <a href="https://www.brunel.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/articles/3D-printer-makes-first-wearable-'battery'##">[...]</a>

Sierra is scheduled for acceptance in fiscal year 2018, and has involved the labor of hundreds of Laboratory and vendor employees. “It’s a major effort,” said Bronis de Supinski, Livermore Computing’s chief technology officer and head of Livermore Lab’s Advanced Technology (AT) systems. “It involves people on my team, making sure ahead of time, that we’ve really specified what we need correctly, and working closely with IBM to make sure they understand what our requirements are across the full range of aspects of the system: system software and tools, compilers, support for performance analysis and debugging tools.

<p><em>"A discovery by an international team of researchers from Princeton University, the Georgia Institute of Technology and Humboldt University in Berlin points the way to more widespread use of an advanced technology generally known as organic electronics. The research, published November 13, 2017, in the journal Nature Materials, focused on organic semiconductors, a class of materials prized for their applications in emerging technologies such as flexible electronics, solar energy conversion, and high-quality color displays for smartphones and televisions. In the short term, the advancement could particularly help with organic light-emitting diodes that operate at high energy to emit colors such as green and blue. “Organic semiconductors are ideal materials for the fabrication of mechanically flexible devices with energy-saving, low-temperature processes,” said Xin Lin, a doctoral student and a member of the Princeton research team. “One of their major disadvantages has been their relatively poor electrical conductivity.

<p><em>"ICFO researchers report the first demonstration of an elementary link of a hybrid quantum information network, using a cold atomic cloud and a doped crystal as quantum nodes and single photons as information carriers. In a recent study, published in Nature, ICFO researchers Nicolas Maring, Pau Farrera, Dr. Kutlu Kutluer, Dr. Margherita Mazzera, and Dr. Georg Heinze led by ICREA Prof. Hugues de Riedmatten, have achieved an elementary “hybrid” quantum network link and demonstrated for the first time photonic quantum communication between two very distinct quantum nodes placed in different laboratories, using a single photon as information carrier. The key elements of a Quantum Information Network are quantum nodes, that store and process the information, made up of matter systems like cold atomic gases or doped solids, among others, and communicating particles, mainly photons. While photons seem to be perfect information carriers, there is still uncertainty as to which matter system could be used as network node, as each system provides different functionalities. Therefore, the implementation of a hybrid network has been proposed, searching to combine the best capabilities of different material systems. Past studies have documented reliable transfers of quantum information between identical nodes, but this is the first time this has ever been achieved with a “hybrid” network of nodes."</em> <a href="https://www.icfo.eu/newsroom/news/article/3789">[...]</a>

At room temperatures, a cloud of atoms is a frenzied mess, with atoms zipping past each other and colliding, constantly changing their direction and speed. Such random motions can be slowed, and even stopped entirely, by drastically cooling the atoms. At a hair above absolute zero, previously frenetic atoms morph into an almost zombie-like state, moving as one wave-like formation, in a quantum form of matter known as a Bose-Einstein condensate. Since the first Bose-Einstein condensates were successfully produced in 1995 by researchers in Colorado and by Wolfgang Ketterle and colleagues at MIT, scientists have been observing their strange quantum properties in order to gain insight into a number of phenomena, including magnetism and superconductivity."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/faster-way-make-bose-einstein-condensates-1123">[...]</a>

Your brain works very similarly to a basic micro-controller receiving inputs and processing them into outputs, in this case your brain relies on your eyes for information. At the same time it's acceptable to walk into a wall when one is blind. Your brain receives no inputs from your eyes and cannot see the wall."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/PIC-Based-LF-and-Avoiding-Robot/">[...]</a>

I knew he has a bunch of guitar/bass effect pedals, but I never saw him use a compressor, so I asked. He's a bit of a feature-addict so he told me the only compressors worth using are multi-band, lots of knobs to play around with. I had no idea what a multi band compressor was, so I googled around and found some example schematics (like here and here).
