<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1803, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Whitworth">Joseph Whitworth</a>. Este engenheiro mecânico inglês, foi pioneiro na medição de precisão. Ele possuía muitas patentes para ferramentas mecânicas, máquinas têxteis e de tricô e máquinas de limpeza rodoviária. Ele criou uma técnica de raspagem para fazer uma superfície verdadeiramente plana. Ele defendeu o uso do sistema decimal. Em 1841, os seus fios de parafuso padrão foram adoptados pelo Woolwich Arsenal. Em 1851, as ferramentas mecânicas da Whitworth eram conhecidas internacionalmente pela sua precisão e qualidade, bem como pelos seus tornos de corte de parafusos, as suas máquinas de planear, perfurar, encaixar e moldar e sua máquina de medição de milionésima parte. Ele também fez um trabalho pioneiro em artilharia, criando um método para moldar aço dúctil para substituir o aço rígido, que está sujeito a fractura.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1805, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Graham_(chemist)">Thomas Graham</a>. Este químico e físico escocês é frequentemente chamado de "o pai da química coloidal". Ele estudou a difusão de gases e em 1833 propôs a Lei Graham, que afirmou que a taxa de difusão de um gás é inversamente proporcional à raiz quadrada do peso da sua molécula. Mais tarde, ele estendeu esse trabalho para a difusão de um líquido para outro. Ele classificou solutos em cristalóides (como sal ou açúcar) e colóides (como a goma arábica e as suspensões de ouro finamente divididas de seu colega, Michael Faraday), que marcou o início da química colóide. Ele desenvolveu diálise para separar soluções coloidais de electrólitos. Esta técnica de diálise agora é importante na medicina. Ele também inventou um pêndulo compensado usando uma bolha com um reservatório de mercúrio.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1841, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Schumann">Victor Schumann</a>. Este físico e espectros-copista alemão, descobriu o ultravioleta de vácuo. Schumann desejava estudar a região "Extreme Ultraviolet". Para isso, ele usou um prisma e lentes em fluorite em vez de quartzo permitindo-se ser o primeiro a medir espectros abaixo de 200 nm. O oxigénio absorveria a radiação com um comprimento de onda inferior a 195 nm, mas Schumann colocou todo o aparelho sob vácuo. Ele preparou suas próprias placas fotográficas com uma camada reduzida de gelatina. Ele publicou na linha de hidrogénio no espectro de Nova Aurigae e no espectro de tubos de vácuo. O seu trabalho abriu o caminho para a espectroscopia de emissão atómica, levando eventualmente à descoberta da série de linhas de espectro de hidrogénio (séries de Lyman) de Theodore Lyman em 1914.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1878, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_%C5%81ukasiewicz">Jan Łukasiewicz</a>. Este lógico e filósofo polaco nascido em Lwów ficou conhecido pelo seu trabalho na lógica filosófica, na lógica matemática e na história da lógica. Ele pensou de forma inovadora sobre a lógica proposicional tradicional, o princípio da não contradição e a lei do meio excluído. O trabalho moderno sobre a lógica de Aristóteles baseia-se na tradição iniciada em 1951 com o estabelecimento por Łukasiewicz de um paradigma revolucionário. A abordagem Łukasiewicz foi revigorada no início da década de 1970 numa série de trabalhos de John Corcoran e Timothy Smiley - que informam as traduções modernas de Prior Analytics por Robin Smith em 1989 e Gisela Striker em 2009.  Łukasiewicz é considerado um dos mais importantes historiadores da lógica.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1904, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Thomas_Bacon">Francis Thomas Bacon</a>. Este engenheiro mecânico inglês foi pioneiro nas primeiras células de combustível de hidrogénio-oxigénio modernas, que eletroquimicamente convertem ar e combustível directamente em electricidade. O princípio foi observado por Sir William Grove (1842) quando ele forneceu oxigénio e hidrogénio para eléctrodos de platina imersos em ácido sulfúrico e uma corrente foi produzida num circuito externo. Permaneceu uma curiosidade até Bacon ter iniciado uma pesquisa séria no início da década de 1940 para aplicação em submarinos. Em 1959, ele desenvolveu uma célula de combustível bem sucedida de seis quilowatts. Quando as células de combustível foram usadas por veículos  espaciais Apollo dos EUA, forneciam energia em voo e água potável, o subproduto da reacção electroquímica.</p>

<p>Esta semana ficámos a saber que o X Lab da Alphabet, de acordo com um relatório da Reuters, preparou mais um outra forma de conectividade com a Internet. Os esforços anteriores envolveram balões flutuantes de Internet e colocando muitos cabos de fibra óptica, mas este sistema de entrega de Internet envia dados sobre feixes de laser! Este não é um sistema experimental como Project Loon; O governo do estado da Índia, Andhra Pradesh, assinou um acordo com a Alphabet para levar a tecnologia a milhões de pessoas a partir do próximo ano. A tecnologia é chamada de "comunicação óptica de espaço livre", e funciona exactamente da maneira como ela soa: aponta-se dois feixes de luz um para o outro e comunica-se através de piscar. "Espaço livre" significa que não se está a usar nenhum cabo e está apenas se comunicando através do ar ao longo da linha de visão. Normalmente isso é feito com laseres, embora para distâncias mais curtas seja possível usar LEDs.</p>

<p>Há muitos robôs que procuram humanóides, mas muito poucos realmente possuem corpos particularmente análogos aos nossos quando se trata de mover e interagir com o meio ambiente. Pesquisadores japoneses estão trabalhando para ultrapassar essa limitação com um robô projectado especificamente para imitar não apenas os movimentos humanos, mas a maneira como os humanos realmente realizam esses movimentos, até suando. Kengoro é um novo robô que enfatiza a flexibilidade e a verdadeira estrutura humanóide ao invés de colocar o poder ou a eficiência acima de tudo.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. São apresentados igualmente as revistas MagPI nº 65, a newselectronics de 12 de Dezembro e a Hackspace Nº2.</p>

<p>Aproveitamos para desejar votos de boas festas a todos!</p>

<h2><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/12/alphabet-wants-to-deliver-internet-access-via-laser-beams/">Alphabet wants to deliver Internet access via laser beams</a></h2>

<p><em>"Alphabet's X Lab has cooked up yet another Internet connectivity scheme, according to a report from Reuters. Past efforts have involved floating Internet balloons and laying lots of fiber optic cable, but this Internet delivery system sends data over laser beams! This isn't an experimental system like Project Loon; India’s Andhra Pradesh state government has signed an agreement with Alphabet to bring the technology to millions of people starting next year. The technology is called "free space optical communication," and it works exactly the way it sounds: you aim two light beams at each other and communicate through blinking. "Free space" means you're not using any cable at all and are just communicating through the air over line of sight. Typically this is done with lasers, although for shorter distances it's possible to use LEDs."</em> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/12/alphabet-wants-to-deliver-internet-access-via-laser-beams/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"There are plenty of humanoid-looking robots out there, but very few actually have bodies that are particularly analogous to our own when it comes to moving and interacting with the environment. Japanese researchers are working to remedy that with a robot designed specifically to mimic not just human movements but the way humans actually accomplish those movements. Oh, and it sweats. Kengoro is a new-ish robot (an earlier version made the rounds last year) that emphasizes flexibility and true humanoid structure rather than putting power or efficiency above all else. As the researchers explain in their paper, published today in Science Robotics: A limitation of conventional humanoids is that they have been designed on the basis of the theories of conventional engineering, mechanics, electronics, and informatics. By contrast, our intent is to design a humanoid based on human systems — including the musculoskeletal structure, sensory nervous system, and methods of information processing in the brain — to support science-oriented goals, such as gaining a deeper understanding of the internal mechanisms of humans."</em> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/20/this-humanoid-robot-works-out-and-sweats-like-we-do-or-should/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"There's a shortage of engineering students and in STEM subjects generally. Whether its developing rockets to Mars, the new future of public transport or a bridge, society needs engineers to make it happen. This team of students are looking to fix this shortage by getting more potential engineers involved and interested in this field. 3D Hubs Student Grant finalist JetX are a team of aerospace engineering students working with Rolls Royce to create the world's first functional 3D printed jet engine model that will provide instant design feedback and show people studying engineering doesn't mean your glued to a textbook. The project started back in 2013 at the University of Glasgow when Chris Triantafyllou the President and Founder of JetX spotted the need for more hands on learning to get people engaged with the subject. Alongside this he saw two important skills for future engineers to master but with no outlet to gain direct experience: Design for assembly Simulation analysis By building such an ambitious project and working with Rolls Royce, JetX hopes to show that engineering isn't just writing down theorems and mathematical equations but about making a real impact with the work you do."</em> <a href="https://www.3dhubs.com/blog/fully-functional-3d-printed-jet-engine-built-by-students-to-create-next-level-in-aerospace/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"SpaceX launched and landed a used rocket today (Dec. 15), pulling off yet another spaceflight double play during a delivery mission for NASA that gets the company a big step closer to its goal of complete reusability. SpaceX's two-stage Falcon 9 rocket lifted off today at 10:36 a.m. EST (1536 GMT) from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, sending the company's robotic Dragon capsule on a resupply run to the International Space Station (ISS) that just might include some Christmas presents for the station’s crew. Both the rocket and its payload have previous spaceflight experience: This Dragon visited the orbiting lab back in April 2015, and the Falcon 9 first stage launched a different Dragon toward the ISS in June 2017. Never before had SpaceX launched a pre-flown spacecraft atop a pre-flown rocket — and never before had the company employed a used rocket on a cargo mission for NASA. The agency approved the use of a pre-flown booster after conducting an extensive review of the risks involved, NASA officials said. "We're very comfortable that the risk posture on this vehicle is not significantly greater than [on] a new booster," Kirk Shireman, NASA's ISS program manager, said in a prelaunch briefing Monday (Dec. 11)."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/39063-spacex-launches-used-rocket-dragon-spacecraft-for-nasa.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Intel today announced the availability of the Intel® Stratix® 10 MX FPGA, the industry’s first field programmable gate array (FPGA) with integrated High Bandwidth Memory DRAM (HBM2). By integrating the FPGA and the HBM2, Intel Stratix 10 MX FPGAs offer up to 10 times the memory bandwidth when compared with standalone DDR memory solutions1. These bandwidth capabilities make Intel Stratix 10 MX FPGAs the essential multi-function accelerators for high-performance computing (HPC), data centers, network functions virtualization (NFV), and broadcast applications that require hardware accelerators to speed-up mass data movements and stream data pipeline frameworks. In HPC environments, the ability to compress and decompress data before or after mass data movements is paramount. HBM2-based FPGAs can compress and accelerate larger data movements compared with stand-alone FPGAs. With High Performance Data Analytics (HPDA) environments, streaming data pipeline frameworks like Apache* Kafka and Apache* Spark Streaming require real-time hardware acceleration."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news/intel-unveils-industrys-first-fpga-integrated-high-bandwidth-memory-built-acceleration/">[...]</a>

A laser-driven technique for creating fusion that dispenses with the need for radioactive fuel elements and leaves no toxic radioactive waste is now within reach, say researchers. Dramatic advances in powerful, high-intensity lasers are making it viable for scientists to pursue what was once thought impossible: creating fusion energy based on hydrogen-boron reactions. And an Australian physicist is in the lead, armed with a patented design and working with international collaborators on the remaining scientific challenges. In a paper in the scientific journal Laser and Particle Beams, lead author Heinrich Hora from UNSW Sydney and international colleagues argue that the path to hydrogen-boron fusion is now viable, and may be closer to realisation than other approaches, such as the deuterium-tritium fusion approach being pursued by US National Ignition Facility (NIF) and the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor under construction in France. “I think this puts our approach ahead of all other fusion energy technologies,” said Hora, who predicted in the 1970s that fusing hydrogen and boron might be possible without the need for thermal equilibrium."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/science-tech/laser-boron-fusion-now-%E2%80%98leading-contender%E2%80%99-energy">[...]</a>

Despite the fact that high-temperature superconductors were discovered three decades ago, researchers are still scratching their heads over how the materials work.

<p><em>"Transistors capable of functioning with an electrical current consisting of the passage of a single electron at each point in time are on the horizon for research in the field of information technology. By associating the 0/1 binary with electron transit or non-transit, the device can drastically improve space usage and reduce power consumption in future computers. This option is not yet economically feasible, but it already exists in the laboratory. An experiment with a device of this kind performed in 2015 at ETH Zürich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, raised theoretical issues that have now been resolved by a group of researchers comprising Luis Gregório Dias da Silva (University of São Paulo, USP, Brazil), Caio Lewenkopf (Fluminense Federal University, Brazil), Edson Vernek (USP), Gerson Ferreira Júnior (Federal University of Uberlândia, Brazil) and Sergio Ulloa (Ohio University, USA). A paper by this group, which is supported by FAPESP, has been published in Physical Review Letters. “The object studied was a nanometric circuit in which electron transmission from one part to another undergoes quantum effects owing to its very small scale."</em> <a href="http://agencia.fapesp.br/quantum_effects_explain_changes_in_nanometric_circuit_electron_flows_/26857/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Approach could bypass the time-consuming steps currently needed to test new photovoltaic materials. The worldwide quest by researchers to find better, more efficient materials for tomorrow’s solar panels is usually slow and painstaking. Researchers typically must produce lab samples — which are often composed of multiple layers of different materials bonded together — for extensive testing. Now, a team at MIT and other institutions has come up with a way to bypass such expensive and time-consuming fabrication and testing, allowing for a rapid screening of far more variations than would be practical through the traditional approach. The new process could not only speed up the search for new formulations, but also do a more accurate job of predicting their performance, explains Rachel Kurchin, an MIT graduate student and co-author of a paper describing the new process that appears this week in the journal Joule. Traditional methods “often require you to make a specialized sample, but that differs from an actual cell and may not be fully representative” of a real solar cell’s performance, she says."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/new-technique-allows-rapid-screening-new-types-solar-cells-1220">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A reimagining of today’s computer chips by UNSW engineers shows how a quantum computer can be manufactured – using mostly standard silicon technology. A reimagining of today’s computer chips by Australian and Dutch engineers shows how a quantum computer can be manufactured – using mostly standard silicon technology. Research teams all over the world are exploring different ways to design a working computing chip that can integrate quantum interactions. Now, UNSW engineers believe they have cracked the problem, reimagining the silicon microprocessors we know to create a complete design for a quantum computer chip that can be manufactured using mostly standard industry processes and components. The new chip design, published in the journal Nature Communications, details a novel architecture that allows quantum calculations to be performed using existing semiconductor components, known as CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) – the basis for all modern chips. It was devised by Andrew Dzurak, director of the Australian National Fabrication Facility at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), and Menno Veldhorst, lead author of the paper who was a research fellow at UNSW when the conceptual work was done."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/science-tech/complete-design-silicon-quantum-computer-chip-unveiled">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A KAIST research team observed a new quantum mechanical magnetic state ‘Jeff = 3/2.’ This first observation of ‘Jeff=3/2’ could be the foundation for future research on superconductivity and quantum magnetism. In quantum mechanics, total angular momentum is defined as the sum of spin and orbital angular momenta and is denoted with the ‘J.’ The newly identified magnetic moment can be described as a kind of angular momentum that occurs when specific conditions are met and has been denoted ‘Jeff’ with the meaning ‘effective angular momentum’ in the field. Jeff=3/2 has been a topic of discussion but was yet to be observed. The research was co-led by Professor Myung Joon Han of the Department of Physics at Chung-Ang University in Korea, RIKEN in Japan, and the Argonne National Laboratory in the US. This research was published in Nature Communications on October 14, 2017.

<p><em>"The innovation could enable development of a range of flexible, impenetrable materials capable of protecting the body and fragile objects Imagine a material as flexible and lightweight as foil that becomes stiff and hard enough to stop a bullet on impact. In a newly published paper in Nature Nanotechnology, researchers across The City University of New York (CUNY) describe a process for creating diamene: flexible, layered sheets of graphene that temporarily become harder than diamond and impenetrable upon impact. Scientists at the Advanced Science Research Center (ASRC) at the Graduate Center, CUNY, worked to theorize and test how two layers of graphene — each one-atom thick — could be made to transform into a diamond-like material upon impact at room temperature. The team also found the moment of conversion resulted in a sudden reduction of electric current, suggesting diamene could have interesting electronic and spintronic properties. The new findings will likely have applications in developing wear-resistant protective coatings and ultra-light bullet-proof films. “This is the thinnest film with the stiffness and hardness of diamond ever created,” said Elisa Riedo, professor of physics at the ASRC and the project’s lead researcher."</em> <a href="http://www.asrc.cuny.edu/2017/12/18/diamene-study/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Abstract In this project I am explaining about how hall effect sensor works measuring fidget spinner speed with arduino board. working:- A Hall effect sensor is a transducer that varies its output voltage in response to a magnetic field. Hall effect sensors are used for proximity switching, positioning, speed detection, and current sensing applications. ... In its simplest form, the sensor operates as an analog transducer, directly returning a voltage.
