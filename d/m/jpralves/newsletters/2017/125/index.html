<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1756, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Loudon_McAdam">John Loudon McAdam</a>. Este engenheiro escocês foi responsável pela invenção do processo de construção de estradas designado por "Macadam". Pedras eram colocadas em três níveis, com as pedras mais pequenas esmagadas colocadas por cima. Isto proporcionava uma viagem mais rápida e segura. Mais tarde, ele adicionou asfalto para fixar a camada superior.
Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1832, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Paul_Cailletet">Louis Paul Cailletet</a>. Este físico francês destacou-se pelo seu trabalho sobre a liquefação de gases. Trabalhando no negócio de metalurgia do seu pai, ele investigou a permeabilidade do ferro ao hidrogénio e outros gases, considerando o comportamento imprevisível de alguns ferros em termos de excesso de gases dissolvidos.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1853, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heike_Kamerlingh_Onnes">Heike Kamerlingh Onnes</a>. Este físico holandês ficou conhecido pelo seu trabalho sobre física de baixa temperatura onde ele liquidificou o hidrogénio e o hélio. Dos seus estudos sobre a resistência dos metais a baixas temperaturas, ele descobriu a supercondutividade (um estado em que certos metais apresentam quase nenhuma resistência eléctrica a uma temperatura próxima do zero absoluto).</p>

<p>Faz também anos que nascia, em 1866, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells">H. G. Wells</a>. Este escritor inglês ficou conhecido na história por ter escrito as obras "A maquina do tempo" (1895), "A ilha do dr. Moreau" (1896), "O homem invisível" (1897), "A guerra dos mundos" (1898), entre outras. Por este motivo foi apelidado de "pai da ficção cientifica" conjuntamente com Jules Verne.</p>

<p>Por fim faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1926, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_A._Glaser">Donald A. Glaser</a>. Este físico e neuro-biologista norte-americano, ficou conhecido pela sua invenção da câmara de bolhas usada na física de partículas subatómicas. Nesta era possível constatar que o comportamento de partículas subatómicas pode ser observado pelos trilhos que eles deixam. Uma fotografia instantânea regista o caminho da partícula. A câmara de Glaser contém um líquido super-aquecido mantido em estado super-aquecido e instável sem ferver. Um pistão que causa uma diminuição rápida da pressão cria uma tendência a ferver ao menor distúrbio no líquido. Então, qualquer partícula atómica que passa pela câmara deixa um trilho de pequenas bolhas de gás causadas por uma fervura instantânea ao longo do seu caminho onde os iões que ela cria servem como centros de desenvolvimento de bolhas.</p>

<p>Na semana que passou foi finalmente anunciado pela Oracle o Java SE 9 (JDK 9), Java Platform Enterprise Edition 8 (Java EE 8) e Java EE 8 Software Development Kit (SDK).

<p>_"Toshiba Corporation (TOKYO: 6502) and Toshiba Research Europe Limited’s Cambridge Research Laboratory in the UK have brought the enhanced security of quantum cryptography closer to practical realization with development of the world’s fastest quantum key distribution device. The device has achieved a key data distribution speed of 13.7 megabits per second *1. The speed is about seven times the previous fastest quantum key distribution speed: the 1.9Mbps that Toshiba achieved in 2016. The details of the new device will be announced at the QCrypt 2017 conference, which will be held at the University of Cambridge from September 18-22. In quantum cryptography, bits are carried and transmitted on individual photons, which cannot be read-out without leaving errors as evidence of the intrusion. Thanks to this property it is possible to test and guarantee the secrecy of quantum keys. <a href="http://www.toshiba.co.jp/about/press/2017_09/pr1501.htm?from=RSS_PRESS&amp;uid=20170915-5146e">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.fujitsu.com/global/about/resources/news/press-releases/2017/0919-01.html">Fujitsu Develops World's First Wearable, Hands-Free Speech Translation Device</a></h2>

<p>_"No need to physically manipulate the device to communicate while care giving in hospital wards and a variety of other situations Fujitsu Laboratories Ltd. today announced the development of the world's first wearable, hands-free speech translation device, suitable for tasks in which the users' hands are often occupied, such as in diagnoses or treatment in healthcare. In recent years, with an increase in the number of visitors to Japan, more and more non-Japanese patients are going to hospitals, creating issues in supporting communication in multiple languages. In 2016, Fujitsu Laboratories developed hands-free technology that recognizes people's voices and the locations of speakers, and that automatically changes to the appropriate language without physical manipulation of the device. That same year, it also worked with the University of Tokyo Hospital and the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT) to conduct a field trial of multilingual speech translation in the medical field using stationary-type tablets. Based on the results, Fujitsu Laboratories learned that, as there are many situations in which healthcare providers have their hands full, such as when providing care in a hospital ward, there was a great need for a wearable speech translation device that could be used without being physically touched. In order to expand the usability of multilingual speech translation, Fujitsu Laboratories has developed the world's first compact, wearable, hands-free speech translation device by developing technology to differentiate speakers using small omnidirectional microphones. <a href="http://www.fujitsu.com/global/about/resources/news/press-releases/2017/0919-01.html">[...]</a>

<p>_"The world is about to have its first quantum computers. The complexity and power of quantum hardware, such as ion traps and superconducting qubits, are scaling up. Investment is flooding in: from governments, through the billion-dollar European Quantum Technology Flagship Program, for example; from companies, including Google, IBM, Intel and Microsoft; and from venture-capital firms, which have funded start-ups. One such is ours, Rigetti Computing, which in June opened the first dedicated facility for making quantum integrated circuits: Fab-1 in Fremont, California. The vision is that commercial quantum- computing services will one day solve problems that used to be unimaginably hard, in areas from molecular design and machine learning to cybersecurity and logistics.1 The problem is how best to program these devices.

For this purpose, they must be composed of several components whose combined properties result in the desired characteristics. Scientists of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) and the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology now discovered that also tiny particles of pure gold have surprising self-healing capacities. Lending shape memory to materials is a very complex, painstaking effort. In pure metals, self-healing capacities repairing mechanically caused defects so far have been considered impossible.

<p>_"The human eye can perceive millions of different colors, but the number of categories human languages use to group those colors is much smaller. Some languages use as few as three color categories (words corresponding to black, white, and red), while the languages of industrialized cultures use up to 10 or 12 categories. In a new study, MIT cognitive scientists have found that languages tend to divide the “warm” part of the color spectrum into more color words, such as orange, yellow, and red, compared to the “cooler” regions, which include blue and green. This pattern, which they found across more than 100 languages, may reflect the fact that most objects that stand out in a scene are warm-colored, while cooler colors such as green and blue tend to be found in backgrounds, the researchers say. This leads to more consistent labeling of warmer colors by different speakers of the same language, the researchers found. “When we look at it, it turns out it’s the same across every language that we studied. <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/analyzing-language-color-0918">[...]</a>

The thicker the tissue, and it could be by only a few hundred microns, the more vital a vascular structure becomes. Researches are hard at work around the world trying to develop viable, transplantable replacement organs using 3-dimensional printing as a way to solve the shortage of donor organs, whether it’s lungs, heart, kidneys or any other organ that can fail.

The researchers also demonstrated that the enzyme, called LepI, can catalyze reactions that were not previously observed in nature. Through computational modeling, they found that the process happens in a unique way that can create two different molecules at once. “Mother Nature has amazing powers as a chemist in using enzymes to construct complex molecules in very efficient ways,” said Yi Tang, a UCLA professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering and a principal investigator on the study. “Our discovery showcased one naturally occurring enzyme and how it can be used as a tool to catalyze a very important and heavily studied synthetic reaction.

<p>_"A project led by the Department of Energy’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory will combine artificial intelligence with massive amounts of data and industry experience from a dozen U.S. partners to identify places where the electric grid is vulnerable to disruption, reinforce those spots in advance and recover faster when failures do occur. The eventual goal is an autonomous grid that seamlessly absorbs routine power fluctuations from clean energy sources like solar and wind and quickly responds to disruptive events – from major storms to eclipse-induced dips in solar power – with minimal intervention from humans. “This project will be the first of its kind to use artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the resilience of the grid,” said Sila Kiliccote, director of SLAC’s Grid Integration, Systems and Mobility lab, GISMo, and principal investigator for the project. “While the approach will be tested on a large scale in California, Vermont and the Midwest, we expect it to have national impact, and all the tools we develop will be made available either commercially or as open source code.” Called GRIP, for Grid Resilience and Intelligence Project, the project builds on other efforts to collect massive amounts of data and use it to fine-tune grid operations, including SLAC’s VADER project. It’s one of seven Grid Modernization Laboratory Consortium projects aimed at boosting grid resilience that will receive up to $32 million in funding as part of the DOE’s Grid Modernization Initiative.

<p>_"Two-dimensional materials called molecular aggregates are very effective light emitters that work on a different principle than typical organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) or quantum dots. But their potential as components for new kinds of optoelectronic devices has been limited by their relatively slow response time. Now, researchers at MIT, the University of California at Berkeley, and Northeastern University have found a way to overcome that limitation, potentially opening up a variety of applications for these materials. The findings are described in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, in a paper by MIT associate professor of mechanical engineering Nicholas X. Fang, postdocs Qing Hu and Dafei Jin, and five others. The key to enhancing the response time of these 2-D molecular aggregates (2DMA), Fang and his team found, is to couple that material with a thin layer of a metal such as silver. The interaction between the 2DMA and the metal that is just a few nanometers away boosts the speed of the material’s light pulses more than tenfold. <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/new-approach-ultrafast-light-pulses-0918">[...]</a>

<p>_"Microparticles created by new 3-D fabrication method could release drugs or vaccines long after injection. MIT engineers have invented a new 3-D fabrication method that can generate a novel type of drug-carrying particle that could allow multiple doses of a drug or vaccine to be delivered over an extended time period with just one injection. The new microparticles resemble tiny coffee cups that can be filled with a drug or vaccine and then sealed with a lid. The particles are made of a biocompatible, FDA-approved polymer that can be designed to degrade at specific times, spilling out the contents of the “cup.” “We are very excited about this work because, for the first time, we can create a library of tiny, encased vaccine particles, each programmed to release at a precise, predictable time, so that people could potentially receive a single injection that, in effect, would have multiple boosters already built into it. This could have a significant impact on patients everywhere, especially in the developing world where patient compliance is particularly poor,” says Robert Langer, the David H. Koch Institute Professor at MIT. Langer and Ana Jaklenec, a research scientist at MIT’s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, are the senior authors of the paper, which appears online in Science on Sept. 14. <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/one-vaccine-injection-could-carry-many-doses-0914">[...]</a>

<p>_"Researchers at Columbia Engineering have solved a long-standing issue in the creation of untethered soft robots whose actions and movements can help mimic natural biological systems. A group in the Creative Machines lab led by Hod Lipson, professor of mechanical engineering, has developed a 3D-printable synthetic soft muscle, a one-of-a-kind artificial active tissue with intrinsic expansion ability that does not require an external compressor or high voltage equipment as previous muscles required. The new material has a strain density (expansion per gram) that is 15 times larger than natural muscle, and can lift 1000 times its own weight. Their findings are outlined in a new study (DOI 10.1038/s41467-017-00685-3), “Soft Material for Soft Actuators,” published today by Nature Communications. Previously, no material has been capable of functioning as a soft muscle due to an inability to exhibit the desired properties of high actuation stress and high strain. Existing soft actuator technologies are typically based on pneumatic or hydraulic inflation of elastomer skins that expand when air or liquid is supplied to them. <a href="http://engineering.columbia.edu/news/hod-lipson-lifelike-robots">[...]</a>

Each individual robot is capable of manipulating a single molecule and is made up of just 150 carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen atoms. To put that size into context, a billion billion of these robots piled on top of each other would still only be the same size as a single grain of salt. The robots operate by carrying out chemical reactions in special solutions which can then be controlled and programmed by scientists to perform the basic tasks. In the future such robots could be used for medical purposes, advanced manufacturing processes and even building molecular factories and assembly lines. <a href="http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/scientists-create-worlds-first-molecular-robot-capable-of-building-molecules/">[...]</a>

<p>_"University of Washington researchers have demonstrated for the first time that devices that run on almost zero power can transmit data across distances of up to 2.8 kilometers — breaking a long-held barrier and potentially enabling a vast array of interconnected devices. For example, flexible electronics — from knee patches that capture range of motion in arthritic patients to patches that use sweat to detect fatigue in athletes or soldiers — hold great promise for collecting medically relevant data. But today’s flexible electronics and other sensors that can’t employ bulky batteries and need to operate with very low power typically can’t communicate with other devices more than a few feet or meters away. This limits their practical use in applications ranging from medical monitoring and home sensing to smart cities and precision agriculture. By contrast, the UW’s long-range backscatter system, which uses reflected radio signals to transmit data at extremely low power and low cost, achieved reliable coverage throughout 4800-square-foot house, an office area covering 41 rooms and a one-acre vegetable farm. The system is detailed in a paper to be presented Sept. 13 at UbiComp 2017. <a href="http://www.washington.edu/news/2017/09/13/uw-team-shatters-long-range-communication-barrier-for-devices-that-consume-almost-no-power/">[...]</a>

<p>_"Tides. In Anchorage Alaska we live on a point located between two enormous tidal bays--so big in fact that Captain Cook on his initial survey of the area thought (hopeful thinking) that this entrance would prove to be a "northwest passage". It is shallow and all boats traversing to the port are aware of the difficulties involved with a tidal basin considered to be the second largest tide flow in the world. Strangely enough when you go through a tunnel to another port not 1/2 hour away the tidal flow is the exact opposite from the high and low tides near anchorage. Tides are dependent on the moon, sun, configuration of the ocean floor and surrounding land masses--in other words they are complicated. Old tidal clocks attempted to simplify these arrangements by reducing the periods of high and low tides to the moon movements. <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Solar-Tide-Clock/">[...]</a>

<p>_"Hello everyone, recently I started working on some robotics related projects using Arduino. But I didn't have a proper base to work on, the end result didn't look great and only thing I could see is all my components entangled in wires. Trouble shooting any error used to take like forever and wiring things again and again was sometimes frustrating. So I decided to make a multipurpose robot along with a motor driver on which I could attach my other components easily without creating any mess and assemble and dismantle it easily for any modifications. If you are a beginner and want to get started with robotics or even when you are planning to prototype a bigger robot project first on a small scale, a prototyping base always comes in handy.

Over the past ten years or so there have been a growing number of consumer products and sensors brought to market that allow 3D gesture and motion tracking for controlling computers, games consoles, and other electronic devices. These include camera-based devices such as the Microsoft Xbox Kinect or the Leap Motion Controller; accelerometer/gyroscope-based devices such as the Nintendo Wii Remote or the Apple iPhone as well as completely novel devices such as the EMG-based Thalmic Labs Myo armband or the Radar-based Project Soli sensor by Google. The majority of these devices - whether officially or through hacks - can be used to control music software; applications such as Geco MIDI for the Leap Motion Controller or Leviathan for the Myo allow these devices to be turned into expressive gesture and motion sensing MIDI/OSC controllers.
