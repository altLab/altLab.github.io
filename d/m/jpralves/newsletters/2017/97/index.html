<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia em 1934, na Rússia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Gagarin">Yuri Gagarin</a>. Este foi o primeiro ser humano a sair da atmosfera terrestre e a completar uma órbita à volta da Terra a 12 de Abril de 1961, na nave espacial Vostok.
Faz hoje também anos que nascia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Goodrich_Acheson">Edward Goodrich Acheson</a>. Este químico Norte-americano natural da Pensilvânia é o inventor do processo com o seu nome - processo Acheson. Este processo é o método que ainda é usado para sintetizar moissanite e grafite. A moissanite é considerada o segundo material mais duro da natureza.
Por fim, também <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Kohn">Walter Kohn</a> nasceu a 9 de Março, no ano de 1923. Este físico e químico teórico nascido em Viena de Áustria e naturalizado Norte-americano ficou conhecido pelo seu papel no desenvolvimento da teoria funcional da densidade. Esta tornou possível calcular a estrutura eletrónica quântica através de equações envolvendo a densidade eletrónica (em vez da função de onda de muitos corpos). Esta simplificação computacional levou a cálculos mais precisos em sistemas complexos, e tornou-se uma ferramenta essencial para a ciência dos materiais, física de fase condensada e a física química de átomos e moléculas.</p>

<p>Esta semana ficámos a saber que Jeff Bezos tem um plano para estabelecer um sistema parecido com a Amazon para uma futura presença humana na Lua. Ficámos igualmente a saber que a Qualcomm está a colaborar com a Microsoft para a aceleração de serviços Cloud recorrendo a sistemas ARM baseados na plataforma de 10nm Qualcomm Centriq 2400. Por fim, a IBM está a construir
o primeiro Computador Universal Quântico para o meio empresarial e para utilização cientifica.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como alguns modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis. É apresentado também a revista newelectronics de 28 de Fevereiro.</p>

<p><em>"More than four decades after the last man walked on the lunar surface, several upstart space entrepreneurs are looking to capitalize on NASA's renewed interest in returning to the moon, offering a variety of proposals with the ultimate goal of establishing a lasting human presence there. The commercial sector's interest comes as many anticipate support from the Trump administration, which is eager for a first-term triumph to rally the nation the way the Apollo flights did in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The latest to offer a proposal is Jeffrey P. Bezos, whose space company Blue Origin has been circulating a seven-page white paper to NASA leadership and President Trump's transition team about the company's interest in developing a lunar spacecraft with a lander that would touch down near a crater at the south pole where there is water and nearly continuous sunlight for solar energy. The memo urges the space agency to back an Amazon-like shipment service for the moon that would deliver gear for experiments, cargo and habitats by mid-2020, helping to enable “future human settlement” of the moon. (Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com, owns The Washington Post.)"</em> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/03/02/an-exclusive-look-at-jeff-bezos-plan-to-set-up-amazon-like-delivery-for-future-human-settlement-of-the-moon/">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="http://www.caltech.edu/news/computing-biochemical-circuits-made-easy-54206">Computing with Biochemical Circuits Made Easy</a></h2>

<p><em>"Electronic circuits are found in almost everything from smartphones to spacecraft and are useful in a variety of computational problems from simple addition to determining the trajectories of interplanetary satellites. At Caltech, a group of researchers led by Assistant Professor of Bioengineering Lulu Qian is working to create circuits using not the usual silicon transistors but strands of DNA. The Qian group has made the technology of DNA circuits accessible to even novice researchers—including undergraduate students—using a software tool they developed called the Seesaw Compiler. Now, they have experimentally demonstrated that the tool can be used to quickly design DNA circuits that can then be built out of cheap "unpurified" DNA strands, following a systematic wet-lab procedure devised by Qian and colleagues. A paper describing the work appears in the February 23 issue of Nature Communications. Although DNA is best known as the molecule that encodes the genetic information of living things, they are also useful chemical building blocks. This is because the smaller molecules that make up a strand of DNA, called nucleotides, bind together only with very specific rules—an A nucleotide binds to a T, and a C nucleotide binds to a G. A strand of DNA is a sequence of nucleotides and can become a double strand if it binds with a sequence of complementary nucleotides."</em> <a href="http://www.caltech.edu/news/computing-biochemical-circuits-made-easy-54206">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Although data scientists can gain great insights from large data sets — and can ultimately use these insights to tackle major challenges — accomplishing this is much easier said than done. Many such efforts are stymied from the outset, as privacy concerns make it difficult for scientists to access the data they would like to work with. In a paper presented at the IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics, members of the Data to AI Lab at the MIT Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS) Kalyan Veeramachaneni, principal research scientist in LIDS and the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS) and co-authors Neha Patki and Roy Wedge describe a machine learning system that automatically creates synthetic data — with the goal of enabling data science efforts that, due to a lack of access to real data, may have otherwise not left the ground. While the use of authentic data can cause significant privacy concerns, this synthetic data is completely different from that produced by real users — but can still be used to develop and test data science algorithms and models."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/artificial-data-give-same-results-as-real-data-0303">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"For robots to do what we want, they need to understand us. Too often, this means having to meet them halfway: teaching them the intricacies of human language, for example, or giving them explicit commands for very specific tasks. But what if we could develop robots that were a more natural extension of us and that could actually do whatever we are thinking? A team from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and Boston University is working on this problem, creating a feedback system that lets people correct robot mistakes instantly with nothing more than their brains. A feedback system developed at MIT enables human operators to correct a robot's choice in real-time using only brain signals."</em> <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/brain_controlled_robots">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Researchers at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) have developed a brain-computer interface (BCI) that can control a turtle using human thought. Their findings have been published in the Journal of Bionic Engineering. Unlike previous research—most notably in insects—that has tried to control animal movement by applying invasive methods Professors Lee Phill-Seung and Jo Sungho of KAIST propose a conceptual system that can guide an animal’s moving path by controlling its instinctive escape behavior. They chose a turtle because of its cognitive abilities as well as its ability to distinguish different wavelengths of light. Specifically, turtles can recognize a white light source as an open space and so move toward it. They also show specific avoidance behavior to things that might obstruct their view. Turtles also move toward and away from obstacles in their environment in a predictable manner."</em> <a href="https://www.asianscientist.com/2017/03/tech/turtle-human-brain-computer-interface/">[...]</a></p>

Currently, hard disk drives use about 100,000 atoms to store a single bit. The ability to read and write one bit on one atom creates new possibilities for developing significantly smaller and denser storage devices, that could someday, for example, enable storing the entire iTunes library of 35 million songs on a device the size of a credit card. Today’s breakthrough builds on 35 years of nanotechnology history at IBM, including the invention of the Nobel prize-winning scanning tunneling microscope. Earlier this week, IBM announced it will be building the world’s first commercial quantum computers for business and science. Future scanning tunneling microscope studies will investigate the potential of performing quantum information processing using individual magnetic atoms."</em> <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/51787.wss">[...]</a></p>

A team led by Jeffrey Mark Siskind, associate professor in Purdue’s School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, has developed three algorithms that allow a wheeled robot to learn the meanings of words from example sentences that describe example paths taken by the robot, to use the words to generate a sentence to describe a path of movement, and to comprehend the sentence in order to produce a new path of movement."</em> <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2017/Q1/language-learning-robot-could-advance-autonomous-vehicles,-help-emergency-responders-in-the-future.html">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="https://www.asianscientist.com/2017/03/tech/turtle-human-brain-computer-interface/">Steering A Turtle With Your Thoughts</a></h2>

<p><em>"Researchers at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) have developed a brain-computer interface (BCI) that can control a turtle using human thought. Their findings have been published in the Journal of Bionic Engineering. Unlike previous research—most notably in insects—that has tried to control animal movement by applying invasive methods Professors Lee Phill-Seung and Jo Sungho of KAIST propose a conceptual system that can guide an animal’s moving path by controlling its instinctive escape behavior. They chose a turtle because of its cognitive abilities as well as its ability to distinguish different wavelengths of light. Specifically, turtles can recognize a white light source as an open space and so move toward it. They also show specific avoidance behavior to things that might obstruct their view. Turtles also move toward and away from obstacles in their environment in a predictable manner."</em> <a href="https://www.asianscientist.com/2017/03/tech/turtle-human-brain-computer-interface/">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"While 3D printing offers great design flexibility before the object is printed, it is very hard for end-users to customize a 3D-printed object to their specific needs after it is printed. We propose HotFlex: a new approach allowing precisely located parts of a 3D object to transition on demand from a solid into a deformable state and back. This approach enables intuitive hands-on remodeling, personalization, and customization of a 3D object after it is printed. We introduce the approach and present an implementation based on computer-controlled printed heating elements that are embedded within the 3D object. We present a set of functional patterns that act as building blocks and enable various forms of hands-on customization. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to integrate sensing of user input and visual output. A series of technical experiments and various application examples demonstrate the practical feasibility of the approach."</em> <a href="https://hci.cs.uni-saarland.de/research/hotflex/">[...]</a></p>

<h2><a href="http://www.nature.com/news/the-quest-to-crystallize-time-1.21595">The quest to crystallize time</a></h2>

<p><em>"Christopher Monroe spends his life poking at atoms with light. He arranges them into rings and chains and then massages them with lasers to explore their properties and make basic quantum computers. Last year, he decided to try something seemingly impossible: to create a time crystal. The name sounds like a prop from Doctor Who, but it has roots in actual physics. Time crystals are hypothetical structures that pulse without requiring any energy — like a ticking clock that never needs winding. The pattern repeats in time in much the same way that the atoms of a crystal repeat in space. The idea was so challenging that when Nobel prizewinning physicist Frank Wilczek proposed the provocative concept1 in 2012, other researchers quickly proved there was no way to create time crystals. But there was a loophole — and researchers in a separate branch of physics found a way to exploit the gap. Monroe, a physicist at the University of Maryland in College Park, and his team used chains of atoms they had constructed for other purposes to make a version of a time crystal2 (see 'How to create a time crystal'). “I would say it sort of fell in our laps,” says Monroe."</em> <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/the-quest-to-crystallize-time-1.21595">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"This Thing contains all you'll need for school. From graphing to drawing geometrical shapes to helping you create that book shelf in shop class, this set has got you covered. Measure everything from distances and radii in centimeters and inches, to angles and even weights! The ruler is a combination scale, commonly used for drafting. It's got 4 scales, a 1:10 and 1:50 engineering scale, and a 1:100 and 1:500 metric scale. The good thing about these scales is that you can use the 1:10 scale as a standard uscs 6 inch ruler, and the 1:100 as a 15 cm ruler. The pencil topper includes 2 different toppers which you can combine to create a compass for drawing circles. The one I printed out works ok if you can hold everything still while you draw your circle. The other topper just attaches to the first one and spins... because reasons. The pencil case has two 30-60-90 triangles that can be used to draw straight lines and angles. In addition, the triangles serve as templates to measure and draw several metric and uscs radii. The handle is a secondary protractor/ruler and can be combined with the pencil topper to measure or draw specific angles. The handle slides onto the peg on the covers and the covers snap into the base. Thanks for reading and I hope you like it!"</em> <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:152531">[...]</a></p>

<p><em>"Hey up there! Here's my new basic project for all ages! I am here again with another Arduino Nano project. Today we are going to create a device that emits ultrasonic waves in the air that could be possibly repelled mosquitoes, cockroaches, rats or even create a dog whistle. This is a multi-purpose project with Arduino Nano! Come on, go ahead and read some information below. This is also known as The Project E.U.E or Electronic Ultrasonic Emitter with a version of basic. This is a traditional stuff device that could possibly repel mosquitoes, cockroaches, rats or even use as a dog whistle. The Project E.U.E consists of 4 electronic components including the 2 pin jumper and the black wire. The project is controlled by a microcontroller which is the Arduino Nano Atmega 328P. It has one speaker (piezo passive buzzer) that emits frequency from 20Khz to 170KHz (the real problem here is that the Nano has only 65535 maximum frequency so that this project emits frequency from 20KHz to 65KHz in reality). These ranges are safe and not annoying because it is completely no noise from this device. It has a light indicator (besides the LED indicator on the Arduino Nano) which is the RGB Module. The RGB module is optional it's up to you if you want to have an indicator to your device because, for me, it is a lot easier to recognize my working device at night when it's dark. I made it blinky to feel like I am watching blinky Fireflies at night lol."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Electronic-Ultrasonic-Emitter-Basic-Version/">[...]</a></p>

Using the NXP Light Link demo project as starting point, I managed to created two custom binaries, one for a monochrome dimmable light and one for a dimmable color light.
