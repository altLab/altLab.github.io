<p>Faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1801, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gail_Borden">Gail Borden</a>. Este fabricante norte-americano foi responsável pela invenção de um método comercial do leite condensado, aquecendo-o no vácuo para preservá-lo e investigou outros concentrados de alimentos. Ele começou com um processo que cozinhava extractos de carne com farinha para formar um biscoito de carne capaz de ser armazenado durante um prazo longo. Quando ele criou uma maneira de preservar o leite, condensando-o, dessa forma ele criou um mercado nas grandes cidades que estavam distantes das fontes do leite, além de fornecer os militares, viajantes e marinheiros.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1885, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Weyl">Hermann Weyl</a>. Este matemático germano-americano fez diversas contribuições na  matemática que permitiram ligar a matemática pura e a física teórica. Adicionalmente ele fez contribuições significativas para a mecânica quântica e a teoria da relatividade. Ele tentou incorporar o electromagnetismo no formalismo geométrico da relatividade geral. Ele produziu a primeira teoria de referência em que o campo electromagnético de Maxwell e o campo gravitacional aparecem como propriedades geométricas do espaço-tempo. Foi ele que propôs a teoria de "wormhole" como a teoria da matéria ligada com a análise de massa de energia de campo electromagnético. Contudo não foi ele que lhe deu o nome "wormhole".</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1897, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_George_Wreyford_Norrish">Ronald G.W. Norrish</a>. Este químico britânico entre 1949 e 1965, colaborou com seu ex-aluno George Porter no desenvolvimento de fotólise e espectroscopia cinética para a investigação de reações muito rápidas. Norrish também contribuiu significativamente para a química quando corrigiu a lei de Draper. Em meados do século XIX, John Draper propôs que a quantidade de mudança fotoquímica seja proporcional à intensidade da luz multiplicada pelo tempo em que atua. Norrish mostrou que a taxa era de fato proporcional à raiz quadrada da intensidade da luz. Foi laureado com o prémio Nobel da Química em 1967 com o compatriota George Porter e o alemão German Manfred Eigen pelos seus estudos em reacções químicas muito rápidas.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia em 1934, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan">Carl Sagan</a>. Este astrónomo, cosmólogo, astrofísico e astrobiologo nascido em Brooklyn nos Estados Unidos da América ficou conhecido pela excelente capacidade de comunicação que tinha e pela sua série de televisão Cosmos. Tendo publicado mais de 600 papers científicos foi também autor, co-autor ou editor de mais de 200 obras literárias. Ele pesquisou a atmosfera de Vénus, as mudanças sazonais em Marte, condições de superfície dos planetas. Sagan foi igualmente uma figura importante na busca por inteligência extraterrestre. Ele exortou a comunidade científica a ouvir com grandes radiotelescópios para sinais de formas de vida extraterrestres inteligentes - projeto SETI. Sagan também desempenhou um papel proeminente no programa espacial dos EUA, com seu envolvimento nas expedições espaciais da Mariner, Viking e Voyager.</p>

<p>Na semana que passou ficámos a saber que a Intel se associou à AMD para o desenvolvimento de um CPU de alto desempenho com uma GPU especializada para permitir a criação de dispositivos mais finos. O novo produto, que será parte da 8a geração de CPU Intel Core, junta o processador Intel Core da série H de alta performance, a memória de alta largura de banda de segunda geração (HBM2) e um chip gráfico discreto de terceiros personalizado para a Intel do Grupo Radeon Technologies da AMD - tudo num único  processador.</p>

<p>Também esta semana que passou, a UBER fez o anuncio que irá colaborar com a NASA no projecto do carro voador. No WebSummit em Lisboa, o chefe de produto da UBER, Jeff Holden, anunciou que a empresa está a acrescentar uma terceira cidade, Los Angeles, à sua lista de locais onde espera pilotar seu serviço de táxi aéreo até 2020. Los Angeles  junta-se a Dallas-Fort Worth e Dubai à medida que as cidades anunciaram trabalhar com a Uber no programa. Juntar-se à NASA é um grande passo para a UBER. Primeiro, permite que a empresa promova a aprovação da agência espacial altamente conceituada aos cépticos. Também codifica a participação da UBER no projecto de gestão de tráfego não tripulado (UTM) da NASA, que foi introduzido pela primeira vez em 2015 para regular o tráfego de drones. Como Ben Popper, da The Verge, escreveu há dois anos: "É uma tentativa de pôr fim à atmosfera do Oeste Selvagem que tem sido a norma para os sistemas aéreos sem passageiros (UAS) nos últimos cinco anos, substituindo-o por um sistema de controlo de tráfego aéreo de próxima geração."</p>

<p>Por fim, Richard Browning, quebrou esta semana o recorde para a velocidade mais rápida usando um fato com jactos controlados pelo corpo. Este inventor Britânico de 38 anos, conseguiu atingir cerca de 52 km/h no fato que ele projectou gastando £40,000. O fato descola verticalmente e pode ser controlado movendo os braços, enquanto um ecran dentro do capacete fornece informação sobre o consumo de combustível.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker.

<p><em>"We often talk about our focus on driving innovation for the enthusiast community, a targeted but growing segment of the PC market. This point is underscored by what we have been delivering with our Intel® Core™ X-series processors, Intel® Core™ H-series mobile processors and, more recently, the first of our 8th Gen Intel® Core™ desktop processors. Each product line offers a range of new capabilities, workloads and form factors to cater to the diverse needs of enthusiasts. But as we looked at this lineup, we recognized an opportunity: thinner, lighter, more powerful enthusiast mobile platforms that deliver a premium experience. Currently, most enthusiast mobile PCs have Intel Core H-series processors plus higher-powered discrete graphics1, resulting in systems that average 26 mm in height. Compare this to thin and light laptops that are trending down to 16 mm or less, with some even as thin as 11 mm."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/new-intel-core-processor-combine-high-performance-cpu-discrete-graphics-sleek-thin-devices/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Uber’s “flying car” project Elevate came whizzing back into view today with a number of key announcements about where it will first appear, who will be working on it, and how this futuristic service will look when it ultimately takes off. In a speech at the Web Summit in Lisbon today, Uber’s head of product Jeff Holden announced that the company is adding a third city, Los Angeles, to its list of places where it hopes to pilot its aerial taxi service by 2020. LA joins Dallas-Fort Worth and Dubai as cities announced to be working with Uber on the program. Holden also said that Uber has signed a Space Act Agreement with NASA to create a brand-new air traffic control system to manage these low-flying, possibly autonomous aircraft. And to round it all out, Uber released a glossily produced video to demonstrate what using its aerial taxi service would look like from the perspective of a working mom who just wants to get home to her kids. As you can see, it’s all very utopian."</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/8/16613228/uber-flying-car-la-nasa-space-act">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Mr Browning, 38, took to the air at Lagoona Park in Reading, Berkshire, on Tuesday to try to beat the 30mph benchmark set by Guinness World Records. Looking like something out of a science fiction movie, he slowly rose into the air and hovered two metres off the ground. His first two attempts were unsuccessful, as he was unable to get enough momentum. But on his third and final try he managed to get up to speed – before mistiming a turn and dropping into a lake. Mr Browning said: ‘I am delighted we have set the record, and I have no doubt that this is just the beginning. ‘I really think we can go on and smash it."</em> <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-5063369/Rocket-man-blasts-history-books.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.washington.edu/news/2017/10/31/how-to-store-information-in-your-clothes-invisibly-without-electronics/">How to store information in your clothes invisibly, without electronics</a></h2>

<p><em>"A new type of smart fabric developed at the University of Washington could pave the way for jackets that store invisible passcodes and open the door to your apartment or office. The UW computer scientists have created fabrics and fashion accessories that can store data — from security codes to identification tags — without needing any on-board electronics or sensors. As described in a paper presented Oct. 25 at the Association for Computing Machinery’s User Interface Software and Technology Symposium (UIST 2017), they leveraged previously unexplored magnetic properties of off-the-shelf conductive thread. The data can be read using an instrument embedded in existing smartphones to enable navigation apps. “This is a completely electronic-free design, which means you can iron the smart fabric or put it in the washer and dryer,” said senior author Shyam Gollakota, associate professor in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science &amp; Engineering. “You can think of the fabric as a hard disk — you’re actually doing this data storage on the clothes you’re wearing.” Most people today combine conductive thread — embroidery thread that can carry an electrical current — with other types of electronics to create outfits, stuffed animals or accessories that light up or communicate."</em> <a href="http://www.washington.edu/news/2017/10/31/how-to-store-information-in-your-clothes-invisibly-without-electronics/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2017/11/02/tools-oil-extraction-can-also-sequester-carbon/">New techniques for removing carbon from the atmosphere</a></h2>

<p><em>"As the world continues to burn 100 million barrels of oil a day – a rate that is expected to continue for the next 50 years – Stanford Earth researchers are developing greener ways of extracting the oil and mitigating the resulting greenhouse gases. Of the approximately two dozen medical CT scanners scattered throughout Stanford’s main campus and medical centers, two can be found nestled in basement labs of the Green Earth Sciences Buildings. The scanner duo is being put to some decidedly off-label uses in research led by Anthony Kovscek, a professor of energy resources engineering at Stanford’s School of Earth, Energy &amp; Environmental Sciences (Stanford Earth). The machines in this case have helped scientists extract oil and gas more efficiently, and are now revealing ways of storing carbon dioxide (CO2) deep underground while the world continues to rely on fossil fuels for energy and transportation. The motorized tables that would normally slide patients in and out of the scanners’ openings instead support machines made from a daunting array of connected pressure vessels, nozzles and gauges shrouded beneath wires and tubing. The larger of the two scanners is about the length of a person and looks like something devised by a mad scientist to power a time-traveling DeLorean."</em> <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2017/11/02/tools-oil-extraction-can-also-sequester-carbon/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scientists have discovered a pioneering new technique to transform ambient heat into motion in nanoscale devices - which could revolutionise future generations of data storage and sensors. The innovative new study by a team of international researchers including Professor Gino Hrkac from the University of Exeter, created a magnetic system capable of extracting thermal energy using a specific type of gear, known as a ratchet. This thermal ratchet is made from a material known as “artificial spin ice” which comprises of a number of tiny nanomagnets - made of the nickel-iron alloy Permalloy and which are 200 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair. The technique is also able to turning magnetic energy into the directed rotation of the magnetization. After magnetising their sample, the researchers observed that the magnetisation rotated in only one of two possible directions, without an obvious reason why one way should be preferred over the other. The study is published in the leading scientific journal, Nature Materials."</em> <a href="http://www.exeter.ac.uk/news/research/title_619514_en.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Life on Earth originated in an intimate partnership between the nucleic acids (genetic instructions for all organisms) and small proteins called peptides, according to two new papers from biochemists and biologists at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of Auckland. Their “peptide-RNA” hypothesis contradicts the widely-held “RNA-world” hypothesis, which states that life originated from nucleic acids and only later evolved to include proteins. The new papers – one in Molecular Biology and Evolution, the other in Biosystems – show how recent experimental studies of two enzyme superfamilies surmount the tough theoretical questions about how complex life emerged on Earth more than four billion years ago. “Until now, it has been thought to be impossible to conduct experiments to penetrate the origins of genetics,” said co-author Charles Carter, PhD, professor of biochemistry and biophysics at the UNC School of Medicine. “But we have now shown that experimental results mesh beautifully with the ‘peptide-RNA’ theory, and so these experiments provide quite compelling answers to what happened at the beginning of life on Earth.” The special attributes of the ancestral versions of these enzyme superfamlies, and the self-reinforcing feedback system they would have formed with the first genes and proteins, would have kick-started early biology and driven the first life forms toward greater diversity and complexity, the researchers said. Co-author Peter Wills, PhD, professor of physics at the University of Auckland, said, “Compared to the RNA-world hypothesis, what we’ve outlined is simply a much more probable scenario for the origin of life."</em> <a href="http://news.unchealthcare.org/news/2017/november/new-theory-addresses-how-life-on-earth-arose-from-the-primordial-muck">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A team of physicists from Rostock University, the Max Born Institute in Berlin, the Ludwig-Maxmilians-Universität Munich, and the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Garching has now shown how electrons can be accelerated in an extreme and well-controlled way with laser light, while crossing a silver particle of just a few nanometers. Of particular importance for potential applications is the ability to manipulate the acceleration process, known as a swing-by maneuver from space travel, with the light waveform. This could facilitate an all-optical generation of attosecond electron pulses. When metal clusters, small nanoparticles consisting of just a few thousand atoms, are exposed to intense laser light, electrons inside the particle are excited to a swinging collective motion. The electron cloud’s motion, a plasmon, can be excited resonantly with light of a suitable color leading to very high amplitudes and an enhanced electric field inside the cluster. In the experiment, which was conducted at the Institute of Physics in Rostock, a team of researches around Prof. Thomas Fennel has now deliberately exploited this enhanced near-field."</em> <a href="http://www.mpq.mpg.de/5573404/17_11_02?1509577200">[...]</a>

The ion qubits can be freely positioned within the trap, such that laser-driven quantum operations at high accuracy remain possible.

<p><em>"A team of scientist at MPQ and Caltech proposes the realization of two-dimensional topological insulators by classical optical networks. In the past decade, a new type of material has attracted raising attraction: the so-called topological insulator. This class of materials exhibits a very peculiar property: they behave like insulators in the interior, but contain conducting states at their boundaries. As these states are “topologically” protected (see below), the states are very robust against imperfections, and electric currents can flow almost without any dissipation. This makes these materials extremely interesting for the task of quantum communication and quantum computing, for example. Now Dr. Tao Shi (at present Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing) and Prof. Ignacio Cirac from the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Garching, together with Prof. Jeff Kimble from the California Institute of Technology (Pasadena, USA), have developed a detailed scheme for an experimental setup to realize a 2-dimensional topological insulator with classical optical networks (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, AOP 10 October 2017)."</em> <a href="http://www.mpq.mpg.de/5575847/17_11_07?1510009200">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A mineral discovered in Russia in the 1830s known as a perovskite holds a key to the next step in ultra-high-speed communications and computing. Researchers from the University of Utah’s departments of electrical and computer engineering and physics and astronomy have discovered that a special kind of perovskite, a combination of an organic and inorganic compound that has the same structure as the original mineral, can be layered on a silicon wafer to create a vital component for the communications system of the future. That system would use the terahertz spectrum, the next generation of communications bandwidth that uses light instead of electricity to shuttle data, allowing cellphone and internet users to transfer information a thousand times faster than today. The new research, led by University of Utah electrical and computer engineering professor Ajay Nahata and physics and astronomy Distinguished Professor Valy Vardeny, was published Monday, Nov. 6 in the latest edition of Nature Communications. The terahertz range is a band between infrared light and radio waves and utilizes frequencies that cover the range from 100 gigahertz to 10,000 gigahertz (a typical cellphone operates at just 2.4 gigahertz).

In a new study funded by the Academy of Finland, Aalto University researchers Alex Westström and Teemu Ojanen propose a method to go beyond special relativity and simulate Einstein’s theory of general relativity in inhomogeneous Weyl semimetals. The theory of Weyl metamaterials combines ideas from solid-state physics, particle physics and cosmology and points a way to fabricate metallic designer materials where charge carriers move like particles in curved space-time. The researchers propose Weyl metamaterials, a generalisation of Weyl semimetals, that enable new types of electronic devices through geometry engineering. “The systems we introduced offer a route to make the charge carriers move as if they were living in a curved geometry, providing a tabletop laboratory for simulating curved-space quantum physics and certain cosmological phenomena,” Alex Westström explains.

<p><em>"The Makey Makey is a great little device that emulates a USB keyboard and lets you make keys out of any somewhat conductive thing (aluminum foil, bananas, play dough, etc. ), which can then be used as a controller for games and educational projects. The Makey Makey has two downsides: (1) cost and (2) the need for a ground connection. This project is a cheap alternative using a $2 STM32F1 board and capacitive sensing. It only has 10 inputs as opposed to the Makey Makey's 12, but it has the advantage that in addition to emulating a keyboard, it can emulate a USB gamepad controller (digital joystick). Parts: "black pill" STM32F103c8 board ($1.90 on Aliexpress) breadboard (less than $1 on Aliexpress) and jumper wires; or just a bunch female-to-male dupont connectors ($0.70 on Aliexpress for a pack of 40) paperclips, alligator clips, etc.Tools: computer UART-to-USB adapter for initial board programming (an Arduino Uno or Mega will do the job, as will a cheap CH340 unit) soldering ironThe software is an example sketch included with my ADCTouchSensor library which allows for capacitive sensing with a single pin on the STM32F1 board per sensor (it's based on martin2250's library for AVR)."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/3-Alternative-to-Makey-Makey/">[...]</a>
