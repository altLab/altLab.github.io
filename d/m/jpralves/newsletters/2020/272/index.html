<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1704, o engenheiro mecânico inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kay_(flying_shuttle)">John Kay</a>. Ele foi o inventor do tear de força com carro voador, patenteado em 1733, o que foi um passo importante para a tecelagem automática. Kay colocou caixas de transporte em cada lado do tear, conectadas por uma prancha longa, conhecida como corrida de transporte. Por meio de cordas presas a um pino de picking, um único tecelão, usando uma mão, pode fazer com que a lançadeira seja empurrada para frente e para trás através do tear de uma caixa de lançadeira para a outra. Um tecelão usando o carro voador de Kay poderia produzir tecidos muito mais largos em velocidades mais rápidas do que antes.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1888, o Físico holandês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frits_Zernike">Frits Zernike</a>. Ele recebeu o Prémio Nobel de Física em 1953 pela sua invenção do microscópio de contraste de fase, um instrumento que permite o estudo da estrutura celular interna sem a necessidade de manchar e, assim, matar as células. Além de sua capacidade de tornar visível objectos microscópicos e incolores, também é possível detectar pequenas falhas em espelhos, lentes de telescópio e outros instrumentos indispensáveis à pesquisa. Nesse sentido, a placa de fase de Zernike serve como um indicador que localiza e mede pequenas irregularidades da superfície numa fracção do comprimento de onda da luz.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1906, o inventor norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynold_B._Johnson">Reynold B. Johnson</a>. Ele é conhecido como sendo o pai do disco rígido. Durante o período em que foi funcionário da IBM ainda foi responsável por outras invenções que incluem equipamentos automáticos de pontuação de testes e a fita de cassete de vídeo.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1926, o Bioquímico americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irwin_Rose">Irwin Rose</a>. Ele recebeu uma parte do Prémio Nobel de Química de 2004 (com os israelitas Aaron Ciechanover e Avram Hershko) por descobrir o papel da proteína ubiquitina nas células. Esta pequena molécula de proteína liga-se a outras proteínas, marcando-as para remoção, que são reconhecidas pelos proteassomas da célula. Estas estruturas são as unidades de eliminação de resíduos da célula, onde as proteínas são quebradas em pequenos pedaços para reutilização. Esse processo mediado pela ubiquitina limpa as proteínas indesejadas resultantes durante a divisão celular e executa o controle de qualidade das proteínas recém-sintetizadas. Processos defeituosos de quebra de proteínas levam a condições como fibrose cística, várias doenças neuro-degenerativas e certos tipos de cancro.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1951, o Cientista de computação americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Bricklin">Dan Bricklin</a>. Ele, juntamente com Bob Frankston, criou o VisiCalc, o primeiro programa de folha calculo (1979) que criou um mercado parar além dos entusiastas dos novos computadores pessoais. As empresas acharam o programa muito útil devido à velocidade e precisão dos seus cálculos. Originalmente escrito em linguagem Assembler 6502 para correr num Apple II de 32K bytes, foi portado para praticamente todos os principais computadores pessoais baseados em 6502 e Z80 disponíveis. Eles não obtiveram grandes lucros financeiros com o programa de folhas de calculo, apesar de, eventualmente, terem vendido mais de meio milhão de cópias em 1983. Este programa foi a ideia base para mais tarde surgirem o Lotus 1-2-3, o QuattroPro e o Excel.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou a JEDEC Solid State Technology Association anunciou a publicação do tão esperado padrão JESD79-5 DDR5 SDRAM. O padrão endereça os requisitos de exigência impulsionados por aplicações intensivas de cloud e data center corporativo, fornecendo aos engenheiros de sistemas o dobro do desempenho e muito mais eficiência de energia comparativamente com o DDR4. A produção em massa deverá começar nesta segunda metade do ano.</p>

<p>Também esta semana ficámos a saber que vamos ser visitados pelo cometa Neowise (nome cientifico C/2020 F3). Descoberto em Março pela NASA este cometa começou a ser visto a olho nu no inicio do mês estando a aproximar-se do dia em que melhor se pode observar - dia 23 de Julho. Trata-se de um fenómeno raro e o ultimo que foi visto já foi à mais de 20 anos. O Neowise é visível em qualquer parte do hemisfério norte, inclusive nas cidades, desde que o céu esteja limpo. Para o ver, é preciso olhar para nordeste, entre as constelações de Dolphin e a Ursa Maior. O Neowise descreve uma grande elipse em torno do Sol e sua órbita leva 6.765 anos, ou seja, a sua última visita perto da Terra foi anterior à invenção da escrita na Mesopotâmia.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos assim como projetos de maker.</p>

<p><em>"An amazing comet that thrilled early-morning stargazers earlier this month is now visible in the evening sky, and it's a sight you won't want to miss. After all, this comet won't be back for 6,800 years, NASA says. Comet NEOWISE can now be seen just after sunset for observers in the Northern Hemisphere, according to NASA. (Sorry, Southern Hemisphere skywatchers, it's not visible there.) The comet made its closest approach to the sun July 3 but was only visible before dawn until now. "If you're in the Northern Hemisphere, you can see it," said Joe Masiero, deputy principal investigator of NEOWISE, the NASA space telescope that discovered the comet, in a NASA Science Live webcast Wednesday (July 15)."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/comet-neowise-visible-evening-sky-july-2020.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://chemistry.princeton.edu/news/lab-resolves-origin-perovskite-instability">Lab Resolves Origin Of Perovskite Instability</a></h2>

<p><em>"Researchers in the Cava Group have demystified the reasons for instability in an inorganic perovskite that has attracted wide attention for its potential in creating highly efficient solar cells. Using single crystal X-ray diffraction performed at Princeton University and X-ray pair distribution function measurements performed at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, Princeton Department of Chemistry researchers detected that the source of thermodynamic instability in the halide perovskite cesium lead iodide (CsPbI3) is the inorganic cesium atom and its “rattling” behavior within the crystal structure. X-ray diffraction yields a clear experimental signature of this movement. The research, “Understanding the Instability of the Halide Perovskite CsPbI3 through Temperature-Dependent Structural Analysis,” was published in the journal Advanced Materials. Daniel Straus, a postdoctoral research associate in the Cava Group and lead author on the paper, explained that while cesium occupies a single site within the structure at temperatures below 150 K, it “splits” into two sites above 175 K. Along with other structural parameters, this suggests evidence of the rattling behavior of cesium within its iodine coordination polyhedron. In addition, the low number of cesium-iodine contacts within the structure and the high degree of local octahedral distortion also contribute to the instability."</em> <a href="https://chemistry.princeton.edu/news/lab-resolves-origin-perovskite-instability">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers integrated photo-patterned liquid crystal into a dielectric metasurface to achieve achromatic and chromatic focusing with a single metalens. The development of metasurfaces opened a horizon for the advance of planar optics. Among various metadevices, the metalens has attracted widespread attention for practical applications in imaging and spectroscopy, where it allows multifunctional wavefront manipulations for improved focus. As part of the trend of miniaturization and integration of photonic systems, metalenses are replacing the traditional refractive lenses made of polished crystals or polymers. But their functions remain static. The prospect of realizing active metalenses has motivated the introduction of materials with special properties, such as switchable bifocals or discrete focal lengths."</em> <a href="https://spie.org/news/liquid-crystal-integrated-metalens-for-versatile-color-focus">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Cell phone batteries often heat up, and at times can even burst into flames. In most cases, the culprit behind such incidents can be traced back to lithium batteries. Despite providing long-lasting electric currents that can keep devices powered up, lithium batteries can internally short circuit, heating up the device. Researchers at Texas A&amp;M University have invented a technology that can prevent lithium batteries from heating and failing. Their carbon nanotube design for the battery’s conductive plate, called the anode, enables the safe storage of a large quantity of lithium ions, thereby reducing the risk of fire. The researchers said that their new anode architecture will help lithium batteries charge faster than current ­­commercially available batteries."</em> <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/news/2020/07/new-lithium-battery-charges-faster-reduces-risk-of-device-explosions.html">[...]</a>

But many beachcombers would be surprised to learn that shimmery nacre is one of nature’s strongest, most resilient materials. Now, researchers reporting in ACS Nano have made a material with interlocked mineral layers that resembles nacre and is stronger and tougher than previous mimics. Some mollusks, such as abalone and pearl oysters, have shells lined with nacre. This material consists of layers of microscopic mineral “bricks” called aragonite stacked upon alternating layers of soft organic compounds."</em> <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/presspacs/2020/acs-presspac-july-15-2020/new-material-mimics-strength-toughness-of-mother-of-pearl.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Machine learning helps researchers and developers design lithium-metal batteries Battery experts at PNNL and elsewhere focus on developing rechargeable lithium-metal batteries because of their high energy density. Lithium-metal batteries have the potential to double the energy of lithium-ion batteries commonly used today in electric vehicles and cell phones. But the right combination of component materials and design is tricky. Now, PNNL has developed a software tool that helps universities, small business, and corporate developers to design better batteries with new materials that hold more energy. Machine Learning is key to battery design recommendations Dubbed Li-Batt Design App, the software uses machine learning to provide the design answers needed. Unlike commercial lithium-ion batteries, the cell design of these batteries—in which the negative electrode is made of up lithium-metal—is very different."</em> <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/news-media/building-better-battery-faster">[...]</a>

Now researchers at the University of Washington have developed a tiny wireless steerable camera that can also ride aboard an insect, giving everyone a chance to see an Ant-Man view of the world. The camera, which streams video to a smartphone at 1 to 5 frames per second, sits on a mechanical arm that can pivot 60 degrees. This allows a viewer to capture a high-resolution, panoramic shot or track a moving object while expending a minimal amount of energy.

Using sophisticated optical microscopy techniques developed at Columbia over the past 3 years, the team was able to directly image these states for the first time, revealing that even at room temperature they are highly tunable and act as quantum dots, tightly confined pieces of semiconductors that emit light. “Our discovery is very exciting, because it means we can now position a single-photon emitter wherever we want, and tune its properties, such as the color of the emitted photon, simply by bending or straining the material at a specific location,” says James Schuck, associate professor of mechanical engineering, who co-led the study published today by Nature Nanotechnology. “Knowing just where and how to tune the single-photon emitter is essential to creating quantum optical circuitry for use in quantum computers, or even in so-called ‘quantum’ simulators that mimic physical phenomena far too complex to model with today’s computers.” Developing quantum technologies such as quantum computers and quantum sensors is a rapidly developing field of research as researchers figure out how to use the unique properties of quantum physics to create devices that can be much more efficient, faster, and more sensitive than existing technologies.

Scientists are unsure as to whether SMBHs were formed in the extreme conditions shortly after the big bang, in a process dubbed a ‘direct collapse’, or were grown much later from ‘seed’ black holes resulting from the death of massive stars. If the former method were true, SMBHs would be born with extremely large masses – hundreds of thousands to millions of times more massive than our Sun – and would have a fixed minimum size. If the latter were true then SMBHs would start out relatively small, around 100 times the mass of our Sun, and start to grow larger over time by feeding on the stars and gas clouds that live around them. Astronomers have long been striving to find the lowest mass SMBHs, which are the missing links needed to decipher this problem.

Writing in Physical Review X, a collaboration including the Department of Physics groups of Klaus Ensslin, Thomas Ihn and Werner Wegscheider in the Laboratory for Solid State Physics and Oded Zilberberg at the Institute of Theoretical Physics, now introduces a novel general scenario for realizing electron optics in two dimensions."</em> <a href="https://www.phys.ethz.ch/news-and-events/d-phys-news/2020/07/a-new-path-for-electron-optics-in-solid-state-systems.html">[...]</a>

While the optimization of conventional microelectronics is slowly reaching its physical limits, nature offers us a blueprint how information can be processed and stored quickly and efficiently: our own brain. For the very first time, scientists at TU Dresden and the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR) have now successfully imitated the functioning of brain neurons using semiconductor materials. They have published their research results in the journal Nature Electronics (DOI: 10.1038/s41928-020-0412-1). Today, enhancing the performance of microelectronics is usually achieved by reducing component size, especially of the individual transistors on the silicon computer chips. “But that can't go on indefinitely – we need new approaches”, Larysa Baraban asserts."</em> <a href="https://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pOid=61364&amp;pNid=99">[...]</a>

Robustness to scattering is a common requirement for communications and for imaging systems. Structured light, with its use of projected patterns, is resistant to scattering, and has therefore emerged as a versatile tool. In particular, modes of structured light carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) have attracted significant attention for applications in biomedical imaging. OAM is an internal property of light conferring a characteristic doughnut shape to the spatial profile.

<p><em>"RMIT-UNSW collaboration applies liquid-metal synthesis to piezoelectrics, advancing future flexible, wearable electronics, and biosensors drawing their power from the body’s movements. Materials such as atomically-thin tin-monosulfide (SnS) are predicted to exhibit strong piezoelectric properties, converting mechanical forces or movement into electrical energy. This property, along with their inherent flexibility, makes them likely candidates for developing flexible nanogenerators that could be used in wearable electronics or internal, self-powered biosensors. However to date, this potential has been held back by limitations in synthesising large, highly crystalline monolayer tin-monosulfide (and other group IV monochalcogenides), with difficulties caused by strong interlayer coupling. The new study resolves this issue by applying a new liquid-metal technique, developed at RMIT, to synthesise the materials. Subsequent measurements confirm that tin-monosulfide synthesised using the new method displays excellent electronic and piezoelectric properties."</em> <a href="http://www.fleet.org.au/blog/liquid-metal-synthesis-for-better-piezoelectrics-atomically-thin-tin-monosulfide/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A new fundamental understanding of polymeric relaxor ferroelectric behavior could lead to advances in flexible electronics, actuators and transducers, energy storage, piezoelectric sensors and electrocaloric cooling, according to a team of researchers at Penn State and North Carolina State. Researchers have debated the theory behind the mechanism of relaxor ferroelectrics for more than 50 years, said Qing Wang, professor of materials science and engineering at Penn State. While relaxor ferroelectrics are well-recognized, fundamentally fascinating and technologically useful materials, a Nature article commented in 2006 that they were heterogeneous, hopeless messes. Without a fundamental understanding of the mechanism, little progress has been made in designing new relaxor ferroelectric materials. The new understanding, which relies on both experiment and theoretical modeling, shows that relaxor ferroelectricity in polymers comes from chain conformation disorders induced by chirality. Chirality is a feature of many organic materials in which molecules are mirror images of each other, but not exactly the same."</em> <a href="https://news.psu.edu/story/624422/2020/06/29/research/understanding-relaxor-ferroelectric-properties-could-lead-many">[...]</a>

Using Arduino MKR1000 &amp; ELM327 micro-controllers we will send various data from car's engine control unit (RPM, Engine temperature, Velocity.....) to the IBM Watson Cloud using MQTT protocol. Also we will create responsive web-app interface using Node-RED (available on IBM Watson Cloud) and custom iOS application with SwiftUI &amp; CocoaPod's MQTT library."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/jassak/mqtt-obd-vehicle-telemetry-f120c4">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The Inspiration One of many solutions to help our front liners fight this pandemic is automating some of their tasks, that doesn't need expert medical background to do it. One of those tasks is delivering things to the patient. Those goods could be foods, medicines, or family-givings to the patient. While it seems not-so-significant, it is actually one of the most frequent thing that our front liners do to the patient. It happens because not all of the patient are suffering chronically from the pandemic, and still doing some normal activities, but quarantined. According to WHO, only one of six person becomes seriously ill because of the disease, and 80% of people recovered without needing serious treatment."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/ferozfernando56/low-budget-carriage-robot-9b29d1">[...]</a>

Integrating the experimentality of the field of robotics with the human imagination, the robot can be remotely and physically controlled while inherently avoiding obstacles, besides can learn from those transferred directions. There are three chief parts of the painter: remotely steered robotic car, physically controlled 4-axis robotic arm and the main controller board. Those parts become a subsidiary to the Physical Twin for expressing its artistic side owing to not only its inherent movement possibilities but also the guidance of individuals. Features -By having a small physical twin, the robotic arm can learn from its twins movements that are controlled by humans and repeat those movements endlessly. -With the aim of having a better control over the Physical Twin; train, record and play modes can be visualised by the LED lights."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Physical-Twin-an-Interactive-Remote-Painting-Devic/">[...]</a>
