<p>Faz hoje anos que <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Wheatstone">Charles Wheatstone</a> nascia em 1802. Este Físico inglês popularizou a ponte Wheatstone, um dispositivo que mede com precisão a resistência eléctrica e se tornou amplamente utilizado em laboratórios. Na verdade, ele não inventou a "Ponte de Wheatstone". O seu contemporâneo, Samuel Hunter Christie, teve a ideia do circuito de pontes, mas Wheatstone estabeleceu o precedente para usá-lo da maneira que mais comumente se usa. Com o tempo, o dispositivo associou-se a ele e assumiu o seu nome. No entanto, ele inventou a sanfona (1829), o estereoscópio (1838) e uma forma primitiva do telégrafo. Ele também desenvolveu um cronoscópio (1842) para determinar a velocidade dos projéteis numa artilharia inglesa.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerard_K._O%27Neill">Gerard K. O'Neill</a> nascia em 1927. Este físico americano inventou o anel de armazenamento de feixe colidencial que aumentou a produção de energia dos aceleradores de partículas utilizando feixes de partículas que se moviam através de uma câmara em forma de anel em direcções opostas. Ele construiu dois anéis de armazenamento em Stanford em 1959, e a técnica logo foi adoptada para inúmeras instalações de alta energia. Como principal defensor da colonização espacial, ele escreveu em seu livro The High Frontier (1978), que as colónias espaciais poderiam ser a solução definitiva para problemas terrestres como poluição, superpopulação e falta de energia. Ele projectou uma estação espacial cilíndrica selada de 1 km de comprimento para ser construída principalmente com materiais lunares processados e usando energia solar. Seria capaz de sustentar uma colónia humana indefinidamente no espaço entre a Terra e a Lua.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que o governo da Nova Zelândia e a Wisk, uma empresa de mobilidade urbana urbana (UAM), anunciaram um Memorando de Entendimento (MOU) para estabelecer um teste de transporte de passageiros em Canterbury, Nova Zelândia. O táxi aéreo totalmente elétrico da Wisk, chamado Cora, é o avião seleccionado para os testes.
Também esta semana que passou a OneWeb lançou mais 34 satélites para o espaço para a construção de uma constelação de 650 satélites. Este segundo lançamento a bordo de um foguetão Soyuz que partiu do Cosmodromo de Baikonur no Cazaquistão.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como um modelo 3D paramétrico para fazer formicários.</p>

<p><em>"The New Zealand Government and Wisk, an Urban Air Mobility (UAM) company, have announced a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to establish a passenger transport trial in Canterbury, New Zealand. Wisk’s self-flying, all-electric air taxi, called Cora, is the aircraft selected for the trials. In October 2019, the New Zealand Government announced that it was establishing an industry-wide Airspace Integration Trial to work with leading, innovative domestic and international industry partners to safely test and demonstrate unmanned aircraft. Wisk, based in the United States and New Zealand, was announced as the first industry partner to join this program. Wisk CEO, Gary Gysin, said: “We are delighted to now have a signed agreement with the New Zealand Government, which will propel Cora’s entry to the air taxi market. We see this agreement as a sign of confidence in our product and abilities to develop and deliver a safe and reliable air taxi service, starting in New Zealand."</em> <a href="https://wisk.aero/blog/transport-trial-to-help-cora-take-off/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Today, FIDO security keys are reshaping the way online accounts are protected by providing an easy, phishing-resistant form of two-factor authentication (2FA) that is trusted by a growing number of websites, including Google, social networks, cloud providers, and many others. To help advance and improve access to FIDO authenticator implementations, we are excited, following other open-source projects like Solo and Somu, to announce the release of OpenSK, an open-source implementation for security keys written in Rust that supports both FIDO U2F and FIDO2 standards. By opening up OpenSK as a research platform, our hope is that it will be used by researchers, security key manufacturers, and enthusiasts to help develop innovative features and accelerate security key adoption. With this early release of OpenSK, you can make your own developer key by flashing the OpenSK firmware on a Nordic chip dongle. In addition to being affordable, we chose Nordic as initial reference hardware because it supports all major transport protocols mentioned by FIDO2: NFC, Bluetooth Low Energy, USB, and a dedicated hardware crypto core. To protect and carry your key, we are also providing a custom, 3D-printable case that works on a variety of printers."</em> <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2020/01/say-hello-to-opensk-fully-open-source.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://news.mit.edu/2020/solid-batteries-lithium-metal-electrode-0203">New electrode design may lead to more powerful batteries</a></h2>

<p><em>"An MIT team has devised a lithium metal anode that could improve the longevity and energy density of future batteries. New research by engineers at MIT and elsewhere could lead to batteries that can pack more power per pound and last longer, based on the long-sought goal of using pure lithium metal as one of the battery’s two electrodes, the anode. The new electrode concept comes from the laboratory of Ju Li, the Battelle Energy Alliance Professor of Nuclear Science and Engineering and professor of materials science and engineering. It is described today in the journal Nature, in a paper co-authored by Yuming Chen and Ziqiang Wang at MIT, along with 11 others at MIT and in Hong Kong, Florida, and Texas. The design is part of a concept for developing safe all-solid-state batteries, dispensing with the liquid or polymer gel usually used as the electrolyte material between the battery’s two electrodes. An electrolyte allows lithium ions to travel back and forth during the charging and discharging cycles of the battery, and an all-solid version could be safer than liquid electrolytes, which have high volatilility and have been the source of explosions in lithium batteries."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2020/solid-batteries-lithium-metal-electrode-0203">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Next-generation devices made with new “peel and stack” method may include electronic chips worn on the skin. At the heart of any electronic device is a cold, hard computer chip, covered in a miniature city of transistors and other semiconducting elements. Because computer chips are rigid, the electronic devices that they power, such as our smartphones, laptops, watches, and televisions, are similarly inflexible. Now a process developed by MIT engineers may be the key to manufacturing flexible electronics with multiple functionalities in a cost-effective way. The process is called “remote epitaxy” and involves growing thin films of semiconducting material on a large, thick wafer of the same material, which is covered in an intermediate layer of graphene. Once the researchers grow a semiconducting film, they can peel it away from the graphene-covered wafer and then reuse the wafer, which itself can be expensive depending on the type of material it’s made from."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2020/flexible-electronics-stacks-chips-0205">[...]</a>

<p><em>"External system improves phones’ signal strength 1,000 percent, without requiring extra antennas. We’ve heard it for years: 5G is coming. And yet, while high-speed 5G internet has indeed slowly been rolling out in a smattering of countries across the globe, many barriers remain that have prevented widespread adoption. One issue is that we can’t get faster internet speeds without more efficient ways of delivering wireless signals. The general trend has been to simply add antennas to either the transmitter (i.e., Wi-Fi access points and cell towers) or the receiver (such as a phone or laptop). But that’s grown difficult to do as companies increasingly produce smaller and smaller devices, including a new wave of “internet of things” systems."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/smart-surface-smart-devices-mit-csail-0203">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers at the University of Toronto Scarborough have, for the first time, turned waste cooking oil – from the deep fryers of a local McDonald’s – into a high-resolution, biodegradable 3D printing resin. Using waste cooking oil for 3D printing has significant potential. Not only is it cheaper to make, the plastics made from it break down naturally unlike conventional 3D printing resins. “The reasons plastics are a problem is because nature hasn’t evolved to handle human-made chemicals,” says Andre Simpson, a professor at U of T Scarborough’s department of physical and environmental sciences who developed the resin in his lab. “Because we’re using what is essentially a natural product – in this case fats from cooking oil – nature can deal with it much better.” Simpson first became interested in the idea when he got a 3D printer about three years ago. After noting the molecules used in commercial resins were similar to fats found in cooking oils, he wondered whether one could be created using waste cooking oil."</em> <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/news/u-t-researchers-turn-mcdonald-s-deep-fryer-oil-high-end-3d-printing-resin">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A team of researchers from Osaka University and Leibniz Institute for Solid State and Materials Research developed the world’s thinnest and lightest magnetic sensor matrix sheet system that visualizes the two-dimensional distribution of magnetism on various surfaces. Conventional magnetic sensor circuits consist of silicon-based hard electronic elements integrated on a substrate with a hardness similar to that of glass, meaning they can be only placed on flat surfaces. Conversely, flexible soft magnetic sensors have also been developed, but there is no device integrating a driving circuit, sensor scanning mechanism, signal processing circuit, and wireless measurement unit, all of which are required to form a system. “This is because the fabrication of a flexible magnetic sensor element is difficult. Furthermore, it is hard to integrate the fabrication process with circuit technology,” explains lead author Masaya Kondo. Now, this joint research team has developed a thin and soft (“skin-like”) magnetic sensor matrix sheet system by integrating flexible electronic elements called organic transistors and giant magnetoresistive elements on a 1.5-μm-thick plastic film."</em> <a href="https://resou.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/research/2020/20200123_1">[...]</a>

Besides, in the condition of low chlorine concentration and a pH-neutral environment, not only chlorine but also oxygen are generated and this reduces the overall chlorine production efficiency."</em> <a href="https://news.unist.ac.kr/a-novel-technique-to-produce-cheaper-and-more-efficient-chlorine-cl%E2%82%82/">[...]</a>

In a paper in Light: Science &amp; Applications, the lab of Chunlei Guo, professor of optics also affiliated with the Department of Physics and Astronomy and the Material Sciences Program, describes using powerful femto-second laser pulses to etch metal surfaces with nanoscale structures that selectively absorb light only at the solar wavelengths, but not elsewhere. A regular metal surface is shiny and highly reflective. Years ago, the Guo lab developed a black metal technology that turned shiny metals pitch black. “But to make a perfect solar absorber,” Guo says, “We need more than a black metal and the result is this selective absorber.” This surface not only enhances the energy absorption from sunlight, but also reduces heat dissipation at other wavelengths, in effect, “making a perfect metallic solar absorber for the first time,” Guo says. “We also demonstrate solar energy harnessing with a thermal electric generator device.” “This will be useful for any thermal solar energy absorber or harvesting device,” particularly in places with abundant sunlight, he adds."</em> <a href="https://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/lasers-etch-a-perfect-solar-energy-absorber-414902/">[...]</a>

Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), in collaboration with researchers at McMaster University and University of Pittsburgh, have developed a new platform for all-optical computing, meaning computations done solely with beams of light. “Most computation right now uses hard materials such as metal wires, semiconductors and photodiodes to couple electronics to light,” said Amos Meeks, a graduate student at SEAS and co-first author of the research. “The idea behind all-optical computing is to remove those rigid components and control light with light. Imagine, for example, an entirely soft, circuitry-free robot driven by light from the sun.” These platforms rely on so-called non-linear materials that change their refractive index in response to the intensity of light. When light is shone through these materials, the refractive index in the path of the beam increases, generating its own, light-made waveguide."</em> <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2020/02/controlling-light-light">[...]</a>

Alternatively, this unique property may open up a whole new world for perovskites far beyond that of today’s standard semiconductors. In a paper appearing Jan. 24 in the journal Science Advances, UC Berkeley chemist Peidong Yang and his colleagues show that the crystal structure of the halide perovskites changes with temperature, humidity and the chemical environment, disrupting their optical and electronic properties. Without close control of the physical and chemical environment, perovskite devices are inherently unstable.

Quantum communications works through a process called entanglement, which creates a pair of photons with complementary properties—one might be polarized so its waves move horizontally, while its twin is vertically polarized. Because the two are linked, determining the property of one automatically tells you the property of the other, no matter how far apart they are.

<p><em>"Last summer, I made an ESP8266 MP3 Sound Machine using ESPHome to play calming sounds when my son goes to sleep. I used ESPHome to develop the firmware so it could communicate with my Home Automation platform, Home Assistant. Well, requirements change and projects need updating. So over the holidays, I created a v2.0 of the project. For the new version, I wanted to: Support two different tracks, which means a second button to toggle things on/off locally A better enclosure and more permanent circuit The project still uses the DFPlayer Mini to read the MP3s to play from an SD Card and an ESP8266 NodeMCU for wireless connectivity. My family is using this to play white noise soothing sounds for our infant to fall asleep."</em> <a href="https://selfhostedhome.com/esp8266-mp3-sound-machine-v2/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In this tutorial we will learn how to build an Arduino CNC foam cutting machine. This is a typical DIY CNC machine because it’s made out of simple and cheap materials, some 3D printed parts and it has an Arduino as a controller. Overview Instead of bits or lasers, the main tool of this machine is a hot wire, or a special type of resistance wire which gets really hot when current flows through it. The hot wire melts or vaporizes the foam when passing through it and so we can precisely and easily get any shape we want. I said easily because building a CNC machine is actually not that hard. If you are a beginner and thinking about building your first DIY CNC machine, just stay tuned because I will explain how everything works."</em> <a href="https://howtomechatronics.com/projects/arduino-cnc-foam-cutting-machine/">[...]</a>

Plugging a CJMCU board onto the Shukran creates an easy-to-use multi-function bus / device hacking and analysis tool with protected (current limited) 5V power pins, 3.3V power, spare pullup resistors and indicator LEDs, all for around $16/£12 total. The Shukran is designed to be assembled by anyone with moderate soldering skills; all components are through-hole except for two larger, surface mount, ones which should be easy to fit with a soldering iron. A fully-populated Shukran board provides: Breakout pins for the FT232H chip ports, and power rails A dedicated I2C header Two dedicated I2C pullups which can be connected/disconnected as needed Two spare pullups which can be connected to the breakout pins and VBUS (5V) or 3.3V as needed Two user LEDs which can be connected to the breakout pins as required using dupont jumper leads Overload-protected 5V and switched VBUS (5V) connection points 3.3V and GND connection points A dedicated indicator LED on the AC9 bus line Unlike some FT232H (and FT2232H) breakout boards, all Shukran 5V power pins are protected by a 500mA polyfuse to reduce the risk of overcurrent conditions or damaging the host USB port. The assembled 2-board setup is compatible with many common tools and apps, such as CircuitPython and OpenOCD, with the added bonus that the FT232H part is easily replaced if it gets damaged; just pull off the low-cost CJMCU board and fit a new one - no more writing off an expensive board or having to think about replacing a surface-mount chip! To make a Shukran, you'll need to order the PCB, required components and a CJMCU board."</em> <a href="https://github.com/linker3000/shukran">[...]</a>
