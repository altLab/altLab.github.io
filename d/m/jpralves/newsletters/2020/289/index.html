<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1746, o matemático e inventor francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Charles">Jacques Charles</a>. Quando Benjamin Franklin visitou a França em 1779, Charles foi inspirado a estudar física. Ele tornou-se um orador eloquente para audiências não científicas. As suas palestras e demonstrações atraíram clientes notáveis e ajudaram a popularizar a teoria da electricidade de Franklin e outros novos conceitos científicos. Com Anne-Jean e Nicolas Robert, ele fez várias subidas de balão, e foi o primeiro a usar hidrogénio para a encher balões (1783). Charles inventou a maioria dos equipamentos que ainda são usados nos balões de hoje. Por volta de 1787 ele desenvolveu a lei de Charles sobre a expansão térmica de gases que, para um gás em pressão constante, o seu volume é directamente proporcional à sua temperatura absoluta.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1842, o cientista físico inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_William_Strutt,_3rd_Baron_Rayleigh">John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh</a>. Ele fez descobertas fundamentais nos campos da acústica e óptica que são fundamentais para a teoria da propagação de ondas em fluidos. Ele recebeu o Prémio Nobel de Física em 1904 pelas suas investigações sobre as densidades dos gases mais importantes e o isolamento bem sucedido de árgon, um gás atmosférico inerte.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou a Apple anunciou o chip mais poderoso que já criou e o primeiro chip projectado especificamente para o Mac. O M1 é optimizado para sistemas Mac nos quais o tamanho pequeno e a eficiência energética são extremamente importantes. Como um sistema num chip (SoC), o M1 combina inúmeras tecnologias poderosas num único chip, e possui uma arquitectura de memória unificada para melhor desempenho e eficiência dramaticamente melhorados. O M1 é o primeiro chip de computador pessoal construído usando tecnologia de 5 nm e tem no seu interior uma quantidade surpreendente de 16 mil milhões de transístores, o máximo que a Apple já colocou num chip. Ele tem o CPU core mais rápido do mundo em silício de baixa potência, o melhor desempenho de CPU por watt do mundo, os gráficos integrados mais rápidos do mundo num computador pessoal e um desempenho inovador de machine learning com o Apple Neural Engine. Como resultado, o M1 oferece desempenho de CPU até 3,5x mais rápido, desempenho de GPU até 6x mais rápido e machine learning até 15x mais rápido, tudo isto permitindo a vida útil da bateria até 2x mais longa que os Macs da geração anterior. Com seu profundo aumento de desempenho e eficiência, o M1 dá o maior salto de todos os tempos para o Mac.</p>

<p><em>"A mere 100 days and 166 million miles (268 million kilometers) separate NASA's Mars 2020 Perseverance rover mission and the Red Planet's Jezero Crater. Landing will occur on Feb. 18, 2021, at 12:43 p.m. PST (3:43 p.m. EST), with confirmation being received back at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California about 11 1/2 minutes later. The six-wheeled Mars car is tasked with prowling the crater - believed to be the site of a Martian lake billions of years ago - to search for signs of ancient microbial life, collect and cache Martian rock and regolith (broken rock and dust), and pave the way for human exploration of the Red Planet. "While we call the six-and-a-half-month trip from Earth to Mars 'cruise,' I assure you there is not much croquet going on at the lido deck," said Project Manager John McNamee of JPL. "Between checking out the spacecraft, and planning and simulating our landing and surface operations, the entire team is on the clock, working toward our exploration of Jezero Crater." On Nov. 9, the mission team confirmed that the propulsion subsystem of the descent stage, which will help lower the rover onto Mars, is in good working order."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7780">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://virginhyperloop.com/press/first-passenger-testing">First Passengers Travel Safely on a Hyperloop</a></h2>

<p><em>"Transportation history was made today in the Nevada desert, where Virgin Hyperloop tested human travel in a hyperloop pod for the first time. “For the past few years, the Virgin Hyperloop team has been working on turning its ground breaking technology into reality,” said Sir Richard Branson, Founder of the Virgin Group. “With today’s successful test, we have shown that this spirit of innovation will in fact change the way people everywhere live, work, and travel in the years to come.” Josh Giegel, Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer, and Sara Luchian, Director of Passenger Experience, were the first people in the world to ride on this new form of transportation. The test took place at Virgin Hyperloop’s 500 meter DevLoop test site in Las Vegas, where the company has previously run over 400 un-occupied tests. “When we started in a garage over 6 years ago, the goal was simple – to transform the way people move,” said Josh Giegel, Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer of Virgin Hyperloop. “Today, we took one giant leap toward that ultimate dream, not only for me, but for all of us who are looking towards a moonshot right here on Earth.” The occupants made their maiden voyage on the newly-unveiled XP-2 vehicle, designed by BIG – Bjarke Ingels Group and Kilo Design, which was custom-built with occupant safety and comfort in mind."</em> <a href="https://virginhyperloop.com/press/first-passenger-testing">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://x.company/projects/taara/">Taara - Expanding global access to fast, affordable internet with beams of light</a></h2>

<p><em>"Increasing access to the internet will require affordable, reliable, and scalable infrastructure. Global internet traffic is projected to grow 24% annually. Fiber-optic cable can support this growth in demand, but rolling out an extensive fiber network often means deployment complications. Planning and digging trenches to lay lines can be time-consuming and costly, and tough terrain can pose physical challenges that make expansion nearly impossible. Because of the difficulties laying fiber in some places, there’s a significant divide in mobile internet speeds between the countries with the fastest internet and those with the slowest. There is a 7X difference in mobile internet speeds between countries with the fastest and slowest internet Source: Opensignal A potential solution to this problem arose during work on Project Loon."</em> <a href="https://x.company/projects/taara/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Holograms have been wowing us ever since they were first invented in 1947. The incredible thing about holograms is that they allow us to experience the real and virtual worlds at the same time. Though they’ve long been regarded as the most perfect way to represent objects with light, their widespread commercialization has thus far been hindered by technological limitations. As part of an effort to find ways to apply holograms to a wider range of fields, researchers from the Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT), which has long recognized holograms’ limitless potential, began to study the development of holographic displays.1 After eight years of trials, the team published a thesis on slim-panel holographic video displays in the world-renowned scientific journal, Nature Communications. What does SAIT’s thesis mean for the study and development of holograms, and how could holograms eventually be applied to our daily lives? To answer those questions and more, Samsung Newsroom interviewed Master Hong-Seok Lee of the Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, along with Principal Researcher Jungkwuen An and Staff Researcher Kanghee Won."</em> <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/interview-samsung-researchers-open-a-new-chapter-for-holographic-displays">[...]</a>

The faster the memory, the more expensive it is, and the faster the data need to be moved between computing elements."</em> <a href="https://discovery.kaust.edu.sa/en/article/1046/keep-the-data-coming">[...]</a>

These systems aren’t just weather monitors, they are also potent tools for research on topics from farming to renewable energy generation. Commercial weather stations can cost thousands of dollars, limiting both their availability and thus the amount of climate data that can be collected.

With plasma hotter than the core of the sun being generated in a donut-shaped vacuum chamber just a meter away from these magnets, what temperature ranges might be possible with different coolants, he wondered. “I was drawing these plans and showing them to my father,” he recalls. “Then somehow I forgot about this fusion idea.” Now starting his second year at the MIT Plasma Science and Fusion Center (PSFC) as a postdoc and a new Eni-sponsored MIT Energy Fellow, Fischer has clearly reconnected with the “fusion idea.” And his research revolves around the concepts that so engaged him as a youth. Fischer’s early designs explored a popular approach to generating carbon-free, sustainable fusion energy known as “magnetic confinement.” Since plasma responds to magnetic fields, the tokamak is designed with magnets to keep the fusing atoms inside the vessel and away from the metal walls, where they would cause damage."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/pushing-envelope-fusion-magnets-david-fischer-1106">[...]</a>

The research team attached experimental tiles to vertical seawalls in Sham Shui Kok on Lantau Island and Lok On Pai in Tuen Mun. Applying the principles of eco-engineering, eco-friendly tiles were created with crevices and grooves that can serve as microhabitats for marine organisms while the shade can lower the surface temperature during low tides and in summer, thus overcoming thermal stresses caused by conventional seawalls. Additionally, bivalve seeding was applied by affixing half of the tiles with the local rock oyster Saccostrea cuccullata as a more natural way to increase habitat complexity. The experiment produced positive results as the experimental tiles with crevices 2.5 cm or 5 cm deep had up to twice the number of species present in the shaded crevices than on the exposed ledges. When compared with flat tiles, the tiles with crevices could harbour more marine species (with an increase of 19 - 51%) and higher abundance of organisms (with an increase of 59 - 416%)."</em> <a href="https://www.cityu.edu.hk/media/press-release/2020/11/05/seawalls-marine-biodiversity-enhanced-eco-engineered-tiles-cityu-study">[...]</a>

Surely, one of the reasons it's caught on. But another reason is that it's actually quite powerful. Once you start using it to the full for your own meetings you can share your screen, presentations, music and videos, and a whiteboard, and you can manage your participants."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Zoom-Control-Box/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The 8008 was Intel's first 8-bit microprocessor, introduced in 1972. While primitive by today's standards, the 8008 is historically important because it essentially started the microprocessor revolution and is the ancestor of the modern x86 processor family. I've been studying the 8008's silicon die under the microscope and reverse-engineering its circuitry. The die photo below shows the main functional blocks1 including the registers, instruction decoder, and on-chip stack storage. The 8-bit arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is on the left. Above the ALU is the carry-lookahead generator, which improves performance by computing the carries for addition, before the addition takes place."</em> <a href="http://www.righto.com/2020/11/reverse-engineering-carry-lookahead.html">[...]</a>

Fortunately, the existing RTUs have the ability to be programmed as Modbus RS485 slave devices. So the solution is to use the Arduino MKR 1400 to interface with the existing RTU devices and then have them connect to a cloud service and send MQTT updates.
