<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1875 o inventor norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Chrysler">Walter Chrysler</a>. Ele começou na adolescência a trabalhar no sector ferroviário tendo subido a cargos de gerência. Então, em 1912, Charles W. Nash recrutou-o como gerente da divisão de produção da Buick da General Motors. Chrysler reorganizou a produção para obter eficiência, aumentando a produção e os lucros, mas renunciou em 1920. Ele resgatou a empresa de automóveis Willys-Overland da falência e depois transformou a Maxwell Motor Company na Chrysler Corporation (1924), que produziu o primeiro carro da Chrysler em Junho de 1925. A empresa cresceu tornar-se um dos "Três Grandes" fabricantes de automóveis.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1878, o matemático norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Kasner">Edward Kasner</a>. Ele foi responsável pela introdução da palavra googol para um número muito grande (10 elevado ao poder 100, que é 1 seguido de 100 zeros) com o nome inventado por seu sobrinho de 9 anos. Foi introduzida no livro não técnico de matemática que ele co-escreveu com James R. Newman, Matemática e Imaginação.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1934, o matemático norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Cohen">Paul Cohen</a>. Ele ficou conhecido pelo seu trabalho fundamental sobre os fundamentos da teoria dos conjuntos. Cohen inventou uma técnica chamada "forçar" para provar a independência na teoria dos conjuntos do axioma da escolha e da hipótese do continuum generalizado. O problema da hipótese do continuum foi o primeiro dos 23 famosos problemas de Hilbert entregues ao Segundo Congresso Internacional de Matemáticos em Paris em 1900. O famoso discurso de Hilbert Os problemas da matemática desafiaram (então e agora) os matemáticos a resolver essas questões fundamentais e Cohen tem a distinção de Resolvendo o Problema 1. Ele também trabalhou em equações diferenciais e análise harmónica. Foi reconhecido com a medalha Fields em 1966.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou foi lançada a versão final do Kernel 5.6 do Linux. De entre as várias novidades destaca-se a integração com o WireGuard VPN. Também está nesta versão o suporte inicial para o USB4 cujo contributo foi dado pela Intel. Este Kernel é também o primeiro a endereçar em 32-bits o problema do ano 2038 (overflow de segundos em 32-bits). Foram feitas muitas alterações no driver de suporte de monitorização de temperatura dos AMDs nomeadamente o suporte para os CPUs ZEN. Foi finalmente incorporado no kernel o VirtualBox Shared Folder driver para melhorar o suporte de sistemas Linux guest out-of-the-box.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos artigos científicos assim como projetos de maker.</p>

<h2><a href="https://news.softpedia.com/news/linux-kernel-5-6-officially-released-529596.shtml">Linux Kernel 5.6 Officially Released</a></h2>

<p><em>"Linus Torvalds has announced the Linux kernel 5.6 with highly anticipated improvements including support for WireGuard VPN. Torvalds says in the official announcement that the development of the next kernel update is unlikely to be impacted substantially by the new coronavirus outbreak, as most engineers are typically working from home anyway. However, he does admit that a slowdown is expected due to social distancing and the pandemic. “And while I haven't really seen any real sign of kernel development being impacted by all the coronavirus activity - I suspect a lot of us work from home even normally, and my daughter laughed at me and called me a "social distancing champ" the other day - it may be worth just mentioning: I think we're all reading the news and slightly distracted,” Torvalds said. “I'm currently going by the assumption that we'll have a fairly normal 5.7 release, and there doesn't seem to be any signs saying otherwise, but hey, people may have better-than-usual reasons for missing the merge window. Let me know if you know of some subsystem that ends up being affected.” What’s new in Linux kernel 5.6 As for what’s new in this fresh release, there’s no doubt the main highlight is the addition of WireGuard VPN support, which is pretty good news for everyone who wants to switch from IPsec."</em> <a href="https://news.softpedia.com/news/linux-kernel-5-6-officially-released-529596.shtml">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Electronically controlled 2-D reflector promises improved microwave communications, beam steering without moving pieces, and one-way microwave mirrors Researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory are reinventing the mirror, at least for microwaves, potentially replacing the familiar 3-D dishes and microwave horns we see on rooftops and cell towers with flat panels that are compact, versatile, and better adapted for modern communication technologies. “Our new reflectors offer lightweight, low-profile alternatives to conventional antennas. This is a potential boon for satellites, where minimizing weight and size is crucial,” said Abul Azad, of the MPA-CINT group at Los Alamos National Laboratory. “The panels could be easily incorporated onto surfaces of buildings or terrestrial vehicles as well.” Most reflectors are reciprocal: in the case of a bathroom mirror, for example, if you can see someone reflected in it, they can see you too. The new reflector design breaks reciprocity, effectively turning it into a one-way mirror. The flat-panel reflector can be controlled electronically, which means its characteristics can be reconfigured on the fly."</em> <a href="https://www.lanl.gov/discover/news-release-archive/2020/March/0320-metasurface-reflector.php">[...]</a>

<p><em>"You know how you leave space in a water bottle before you pop it in the freezer—to accommodate the fact that water expands as it freezes? Most metal parts in airplanes face the more common opposite problem. At high altitudes (low temperatures) they shrink. To keep such shrinkage from causing major disasters, engineers make airplanes out of composites or alloys, mixing materials that have opposite expansion properties to balance one another out. New research conducted in part at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Brookhaven National Laboratory may bring a whole new class of chemical elements into this materials science balancing act. As described in a paper just published in the journal Physical Review Letters, scientists used x-rays at Brookhaven’s National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II)—a U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science user facility—and two other synchrotron light sources to explore an unusual metal that expands dramatically at low temperature."</em> <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=117135">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Technique may enable speedy, on-demand design of softer, safer neural devices. The brain is one of our most vulnerable organs, as soft as the softest tofu. Brain implants, on the other hand, are typically made from metal and other rigid materials that over time can cause inflammation and the buildup of scar tissue. MIT engineers are working on developing soft, flexible neural implants that can gently conform to the brain’s contours and monitor activity over longer periods, without aggravating surrounding tissue. Such flexible electronics could be softer alternatives to existing metal-based electrodes designed to monitor brain activity, and may also be useful in brain implants that stimulate neural regions to ease symptoms of epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, and severe depression. Led by Xuanhe Zhao, a professor of mechanical engineering and of civil and environmental engineering, the research team has now developed a way to 3D print neural probes and other electronic devices that are as soft and flexible as rubber."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2020/engineers-3d-print-brain-implants-0330">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Device for harnessing terahertz radiation might enable self-powering implants, cellphones, other portable electronics. Any device that sends out a Wi-Fi signal also emits terahertz waves —electromagnetic waves with a frequency somewhere between microwaves and infrared light. These high-frequency radiation waves, known as “T-rays,” are also produced by almost anything that registers a temperature, including our own bodies and the inanimate objects around us. Terahertz waves are pervasive in our daily lives, and if harnessed, their concentrated power could potentially serve as an alternate energy source. Imagine, for instance, a cellphone add-on that passively soaks up ambient T-rays and uses their energy to charge your phone. However, to date, terahertz waves are wasted energy, as there has been no practical way to capture and convert them into any usable form."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2020/energy-harvesting-wi-fi-power-0327">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Entangled photons can be used to improve imaging and measurement techniques. A team of researchers from the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Optics and Precision Engineering IOF in Jena has developed a quantum imaging solution that can facilitate highly detailed insights into tissue samples using extreme spectral ranges and less light. While optical analysis techniques such as microscopy and spectroscopy are extremely efficient in visible wavelength ranges, they quickly reach their limits in the infrared or terahertz range. That, however, is precisely where valuable information is hidden. For example, bio-substances such as proteins, lipids and other biochemical components can be distinguished based on their characteristic molecular vibrations. These vibrations are stimulated by light in the mid-infrared to terahertz range and are very difficult to detect with conventional measurement techniques."</em> <a href="https://www.fraunhofer.de/en/press/research-news/2020/april/making-the-invisible-visible.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers at Linköping University, working with colleagues in Great Britain, China and the Czech Republic, have developed a perovskite light-emitting diode (LED) with both high efficiency and long operational stability. “Light-emitting diodes based on perovskites are still not sufficiently stable for practical use, but we have brought them one step closer”, says professor Feng Gao, and head of research at the Division of Biomolecular and Organic Electronics, Linköping University. Perovskites are a large family of semiconducting materials that have aroused the interest of scientists around the world. Their special crystal structure means that they have excellent optical and electronic properties, while they are both easy and cheap to manufacture. Most progress has been made in research into the use of perovskites in solar cells, but they are also well-suited for the manufacture of LEDs. The efficiency of the LEDs, which measures the fraction of charge carriers input to the material that are subsequently emitted as light, has increased considerably in recent years, and will soon reach that of competing technology."</em> <a href="https://liu.se/en/news-item/ett-steg-narmare-en-stabil-lysdiod-i-perovskit">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.fuw.edu.pl/press-release/news6322.html">Does relativity lie at the source of quantum exoticism?</a></h2>

<p><em>"Since its beginnings, quantum mechanics hasn’t ceased to amaze us with its peculiarity, so difficult to understand. Why does one particle seem to pass through two slits simultaneously? Why instead of specific predictions can we only talk about evolution of probabilities? According to theorists from universities in Warsaw and Oxford, the most important features of the quantum world may result from the special theory of relativity, which until now seemed to have little to do with quantum mechanics. Since the arrival of quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity, physicists have lost sleep over the incompatibility of these three concepts (three, since there are two theories of relativity: special and general). It has commonly been accepted that it is the description of quantum mechanics that is the more fundamental and that the theory of relativity that will have to be adjusted to it."</em> <a href="https://www.fuw.edu.pl/press-release/news6322.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Turning a brittle oxide into a flexible membrane and stretching it on a tiny apparatus flipped it from a conducting to an insulating state and changed its magnetic properties. The technique can be used to study and design a broad range of materials for use in things like sensors and detectors. One way to change the properties of a material is to stretch it just a wee bit, so its atoms are farther apart but the bonds between them don’t break. This extra distance affects the behavior of electrons, which determine whether the material is an insulator or a conductor of electricity, for instance. But for an important class of complex oxide materials, stretching doesn’t work so well; they’re as brittle as ceramic coffee cups and would break. Scientists at the Department of Energy’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and Stanford University have now found a way around this problem for a complex oxide known as LCMO."</em> <a href="https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/news/2020-04-02-new-way-fine-tune-exotic-materials-thin-stretch-and-clamp.aspx">[...]</a>

A new technique developed by researchers at the University of Michigan could enable broader adoption of post-Moore’s Law computing components through automatic code translation. The system, called AutomataSynth, allows software engineers to tap into the power of hardware accelerators like FPGAs without specialized programming knowledge or needing to rewrite old, CPU-centric code. With Moore’s Law nearing its end, companies and designers rely on a number of hardware techniques to circumvent the diminishing returns provided by new CPUs.

While the technology to disentangle multiple, parallel signals moving through a channel already exists, thanks to signal processing methods developed by John Cioffi, the inventor of digital subscriber lines, or DSL, questions remained related to the effectiveness of implementing these ideas at higher frequencies. To test the transmission of data at higher frequencies, authors of a paper published this week in Applied Physics Letters, from AIP Publishing, used experimental measurements and mathematical modeling to characterize the input and output signals in a waveguide. They used a device with two wires running parallel inside a sheath with a large diameter that facilitates increased mixing of the waveguide modes. These mixtures enable the transmission of parallel noninterfering data channels."</em> <a href="https://publishing.aip.org/publications/latest-content/extreme-high-frequency-signals-enable-terabits-per-second-data-links/">[...]</a>

Asteroids have the potential to impact Earth and cause damage at the local to global scale. Humankind is capable of deflecting or disrupting a potentially hazardous object. However, due to the limited ability to perform experiments directly on asteroids, understanding how multiple variables might affect a kinetic deflection attempt relies upon large-scale hydrodynamic simulations thoroughly vetted against relevant laboratory‐scale experiments. “We’re preparing for something that has a very low probability of happening in our lifetimes, but a very high consequence if it were to occur,” Remington said."</em> <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/news/planetary-defenders-validate-asteroid-deflection-code">[...]</a>

I found one nice design here but the position of the buttons is not perfect.
