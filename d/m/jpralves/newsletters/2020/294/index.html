<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1778, o químico inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphry_Davy">Humphry Davy</a>. Ele descobriu vários elementos e compostos químicos, inventou a lâmpada de segurança do mineiro e resumiu o método científico. Davy descobriu os metais alcalinos: potássio e sódio, um isolamento feito com corrente eléctrica pela primeira vez; bem como metais alcalino-ferrosos: cálcio, estrôncio, bário e magnésio (1808). Ele descobriu o boro ao mesmo tempo que Gay-Lussac. Ele reconheceu o cloro como um elemento que os trabalhadores anteriores confundiam como um composto.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1797, o físico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Henry">Joseph Henry</a>. Ele foi um dos notáveis cientistas americanos depois de Benjamin Franklin. Quando adolescente, Henry interessou-se por teatro, mas depois de ler um livro de palestras sobre ciências, a sua vida voltou-se para sempre nessa busca. Ele ajudou Samuel F.B. Morse no desenvolvimento do telégrafo. Independentemente de Michael Faraday, Henry investigou a electricidade e o magnetismo e descobriu o fenómeno da auto-indução. (Seu nome foi dado à unidade SI de indutância, o henry, H). Ele foi o primeiro director do Smithsonian Institution (1846-1878), onde iniciou a fundação de um serviço meteorológico nacional. Henry insistiu que a pesquisa básica era de fundamental importância, não um luxo.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1842, o matemático norueguês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophus_Lie">Sophus Lie</a>. Ele fez contribuições significativas para as teorias de invariantes algébricos, grupos contínuos de transformações e equações diferenciais. Grupos de Lie e álgebras de Lie foram nomeados em sua homenagem. Lie estava em Paris na eclosão da guerra franco-alemã de 1870. Lie deixou a França, decidindo ir para a Itália. No caminho, ele foi preso como um espião alemão e as suas notas matemáticas foram consideradas mensagens codificadas. Só após a intervenção do matemático francês Gaston Darboux, Lie foi libertado e decidiu regressar a Christiania, na Noruega, onde originalmente tinha estudado matemática para continuar o seu trabalho.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1861, o engenheiro electrotécnico de origem irlandesa <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_E._Kennelly">Arthur Edwin Kennelly</a>. Ele fez inovações em métodos analíticos em electrónica, particularmente a aplicação definitiva da teoria dos números complexos para circuitos de corrente alternada (CA). Após sua co-descoberta (com Oliver Heaviside) das propriedades reflexivas de rádio da ionosfera na atmosfera superior, o estrato foi chamado de camada Kennelly-Heaviside.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1908, o químico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willard_Libby">Willard Libby</a>. Ele descobriu a técnica de datação por carbono-14 (ou radiocarbono) que forneceu uma ferramenta extremamente valiosa para arqueólogos, antropólogos e cientistas da Terra. Por esse desenvolvimento, ele foi homenageado com o Prémio Nobel de Química em 1960. Libby é um especialista em radioquímica, particularmente química de átomos quentes, técnicas de traçadores e trabalho com traçadores de isótopos. Ele tornou-se conhecido na Universidade de Chicago também pelo seu trabalho com trítio natural e seu uso em hidrologia e geofísica. Em 18 de maio de 1952, ele determinou que a idade de Stonehenge era 1848 aC, com base na análise de radio-isótopos no carvão.</p>

<p>Faz hoje anos que, em 1903, os primeiros voos tripulados, motorizados, sustentados e controlados foram realizados pelos irmãos Wright com o The Flyer, um biplano de madeira e tecido, em Kitty Hawk, Carolina do Norte. Apesar de um frio cortante, vento de 27 mph, às 10 da manhã, os Wrights decidiram tentar um voo. Orville Wright, lançado de uma pista contra o vento. O biplano voou baixo sobre o solo por 37 m, no ar por 12 segundos. Pela primeira vez, uma máquina que carregava um homem ergueu-se no ar pela sua própria força em pleno voo, voou para a frente sem redução de velocidade e finalmente pousou num ponto tão alto como aquele de onde tinha partido. Mais três voos foram feitos nas horas seguintes. O último, com Wilbur Wright a bordo, foi o mais longo, cobrindo 260 m em 59 segundos. O vento então perturbou o Flyer, danificando-o e ele nunca mais voou.</p>

<p>Em 1979, o primeiro veículo foguete que alegadamente quebrou a barreira do som em terra foi conduzido pelo piloto acrobático Stan Barrett, que atingiu 1190 km/h (mais rápido que a velocidade do som) numa pista de testes de 4.8 quilómetros em Rogers Lake, Edwards Air Force Base, Califórnia. O seu veículo de três rodas tinha 48.000 h.p. o foguete impulsionado por 12.000 h.p. de um Míssil Sidewinder. Foi interrompido por um pára-quedas de arrasto. O carro em formato de avião custou cerca de US $ 800.000. O recorde de velocidade nunca se tornou oficial porque a média de duas corridas é necessária, e o carro nunca mais andou. Além disso, a carga de combustível do carro era insuficiente para permitir que ele completasse uma milha medida em velocidade recorde, e os motores de foguete não poderiam ser preparados para uma volta de retorno dentro do período estipulado de 1 hora.)</p>

<p>E nesta semana que passou a cápsula da sonda Chang'e-5 pousou cerca das 2 horas locais (18 horas em Portugal) no distrito de Siziwang, na região da Mongólia Interior no passado dia 16. Passaram-se mais de 40 anos desde que as missões American Apollo e a Soviética Luna trouxeram as suas amostras para casa. Os novos espécimes devem fornecer uma nova visão sobre a geologia e a história do satélite da Terra. Não está claro a quantidade, mas possivelmente na faixa de 2-4kg.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou a Agência de Exploração Aeroespacial do Japão (JAXA )tem o prazer de confirmar que as amostras do asteróide Ryugu foram recolhidas dentro do recipiente de amostra dentro da cápsula de reentrada do explorador de asteróide, Hayabusa2. A cápsula Hayabusa2 foi recuperada em Woomera, Austrália, em 6 de Dezembro de 2020 e entregue no Campus JAXA Sagamihara a 8 de Dezembro. Os trabalhos começaram então para abrir o recipiente das amostras dentro da cápsula de reentrada. A 14 de Dezembro, uma amostra de grãos de areia preta que se pensava ser derivada do asteróide Ryugu foi confirmada estar dentro do recipiente de amostra. Acredita-se que sejam partículas presas à entrada do colector de amostras (o recipiente no qual as amostras foram armazenadas).</p>

<p>Também esta semana Linus Torvalds anunciou a disponibilização do kernel de Linux 5.10 LTS. Como de costume, após dois meses de desenvolvimento, o criador do Linux Linus Torvalds lançou oficialmente um novo kernel Linux 5.10. É também o kernel de suporte a longo prazo (LTS) mais recente, que será mantido e receberá correcções de bugs durante os próximos cinco anos até 2026. Como novidades o sistema de ficheiros XFS suporta agora "timestamps" até ao 2486 em vez da limitação anterior para o ano 2038, e o EXT4 suporta o modo de confirmação rápida para um desempenho de reescrita de ficheiros mais rápido. O sistema de ficheiros Btrfs também recebeu melhorias significativas de desempenho na área de operação fsync. Adicionalmente este kernel suporta o display do Raspberry Pi 4 através do driver VC4 DRM. De entre as restantes novidades temos o suporte para o controlador da Nintendo Switch, boot EFI de RISC-V, suporte para extensão de marcação de memória ARM, suporte para placa de som Creative Labs SoundBlaster AE-7, suporte para processador Ingenic MIPS X2000 / X2000E IoT, suporte de processadores de display AMDGPU DC GCN 1.0 “Southern Islands” assim como de encriptação de registos nos ambientes virtualizados de ADM.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos assim como projetos de maker. É apresentado o livro Data Parallel C++ e a revista MagPI nº 101 de Janeiro de 2021.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-55323176">China's Chang'e-5 mission returns Moon samples</a></h2>

<p><em>"China's Chang'e-5 mission has returned to Earth with the cargo of rock and "soil" it picked up off the Moon. A capsule carrying the materials landed in Inner Mongolia at 01:59 local time on Thursday (17:59 GMT, Wednesday). It's more than 40 years since the American Apollo and Soviet Luna missions brought their samples home. The new specimens should provide fresh insight on the geology and early history of Earth's satellite. For China, the successful completion of the Chang'e-5 venture will also be seen as another demonstration of the nation's increasing capability in space. Recovery teams were quick to move in on the returned capsule."</em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-55323176">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency is pleased to confirm that samples from asteroid Ryugu have been collected within the sample container inside the re-entry capsule of the asteroid explorer, Hayabusa2. The Hayabusa2 re-entry capsule was recovered in Woomera, Australia on December 6, 2020 and delivered to the JAXA Sagamihara Campus on December 8. Work then began to open the sample container inside the re-entry capsule. On December 14, a sample of grains of black sand thought to be derived from asteroid Ryugu was confirmed to be inside the sample container. These are believed to be particles attached to the entrance of the sample catcher (the container in which the samples have been stored). Work will continue with opening the sample catcher that sits in the sample container."</em> <a href="https://global.jaxa.jp/press/2020/12/20201214-1_e.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/about/news-releases/products/microchip-adds-64-mbit-parallel-superflash-memory-to-its-family-of-radiation-tolerant-cots-based-devices-for-space-systems">Microchip Adds 64 Mbit Parallel SuperFlash® Memory to its Family of Radiation-Tolerant COTS-Based Devices for Space Systems</a></h2>

<p><em>"Complements company’s COTS-based processors and communication interfaces to streamline development of space-qualified and scalable total system solutions To reduce the time, cost and risk of developing spaceflight-qualified systems, designers may start with Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) devices that can later be replaced by their space-qualified, radiation-tolerant equivalent parts available in plastic or ceramic packages featuring the same pinout distribution. Microchip Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP) today announced a radiation-tolerant, 64 Megabit (Mbit) parallel-interface SuperFlash memory device with unrivaled Total Ionizing Dose (TID) tolerance for maximum reliability and robustness in the harsh radiation environment of space missions. It is an ideal companion to Microchip’s space-ready microcontrollers (MCUs), microprocessors (MPUs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) that provide the building blocks for this scalable development model. “The SST38LF6401RT SuperFlash device further strengthens our scalable approach to developing total space system solutions using our radiation-tolerant or radiation-hardened microprocessors and FPGAs,” said Bob Vampola, associate vice president of Microchip’s aerospace and defense business unit. “It offers the vital protection these space systems need for the most reliable digital processing where companion Flash memory is required to store the critical software code or bitstream that drives the complete system.” Radiation-tolerant up to 50 kilorad (krad) TID, even while the Flash is still biased and operating, the SST38LF6401RT device enables systems to operate in a broad range of space applications where they cannot afford any loss of code execution that could lead to severe defects and system loss. It is an ideal companion to Microchip’s SAMRH71 Arm® Cortex®-M7-based radiation-hardened SoC processor and can also be used with the company’s RT PolarFire® FPGAs to support in-flight system reconfiguration."</em> <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/about/news-releases/products/microchip-adds-64-mbit-parallel-superflash-memory-to-its-family-of-radiation-tolerant-cots-based-devices-for-space-systems">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Today, IBM (NYSE: IBM) Security launched a new service that allows companies to experiment with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) – an emerging technology designed to allow data to remain encrypted even while being processed or analyzed in cloud or third-party environments. The new IBM Security Homomorphic Encryption Services provide companies with education, expert support, and a testing environment for clients to develop prototype applications that can take advantage of FHE. With the growth of hybrid cloud, sensitive data will be even more broadly stored, shared and analyzed across platforms and parties, exposing it to varying security controls and risks. While current encryption techniques allow data to be protected during storage and in transit, data must be decrypted while it is being processed or analyzed – creating a window of opportunity where data is more vulnerable to theft or exposure. FHE is an emerging and advanced encryption technology that allows data to remain encrypted even while it’s being processed, potentially closing this critical gap in current encryption solutions being used today. “Fully homomorphic encryption holds tremendous potential for the future of privacy and cloud computing, but businesses must begin learning about and experimenting with FHE before they can take full advantage of what it has to offer,” said Sridhar Muppidi, Chief Technology Officer, IBM Security."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2020-12-17-IBM-Helps-Prepare-Clients-for-Next-Generation-Encryption-Technology#assets_all#assets_all">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Small launch vehicle developer Astra Space fell just short of reaching orbit on its second launch attempt Dec. 15, but the company is “beyond ecstatic” with the performance of the rocket. Astra’s Rocket 3.2 vehicle lifted off from Pacific Spaceport Complex – Alaska at 3:55 p.m. Eastern. The company did not provide a live webcast of the launch but instead offered a series of updates via Twitter as the vehicle made it through its initial phases of flight, including main engine cutoff, stage separation and passing the Karman Line, the 100-kilometer altitude commonly used as the demarcation of space. The rocket’s upper stage fired its single engine, gaining altitude and speed. However, Chris Kemp, chief executive of Astra, said in a call with reporters that the upper stage engine shut down about 12 to 15 seconds early when it depleted its fuel. The rocket reached a peak altitude of 390 kilometers and speed of 7.2 kilometers per second, about 0.5 kilometers short of orbital velocity."</em> <a href="https://spacenews.com/astra-narrowly-misses-reaching-orbit-on-second-launch/">[...]</a>

In a new paper published in the journal Nature Communications Earth and Environment, researchers at the University of Rochester were able to use magnetism to determine, for the first time, when carbonaceous chondrite asteroids—asteroids that are rich in water and amino acids—first arrived in the inner solar system. The research provides data that helps inform scientists about the early origins of the solar system and why some planets, such as Earth, became habitable and were able to sustain conditions conducive for life, while other planets, such as Mars, did not. The research also gives scientists data that can be applied to the discovery of new exoplanets. “There is special interest in defining this history—in reference to the huge number of exoplanet discoveries—to deduce whether events might have been similar or different in exo-solar systems,” says John Tarduno, the William R.

<p><em>"JILA physicists have boosted the signal power of their atomic “tweezer clock” and measured its performance in part for the first time, demonstrating high stability close to the best of the latest generation of atomic clocks. The unusual clock, which uses laser tweezers to trap, control and isolate atoms, offers unique possibilities for enhancing clock performance using the tricks of quantum physics as well as for future applications in quantum information processing, quantum simulation and measurement science. Described in a new Nature paper, the clock platform is a rectangular grid of about 150 strontium atoms confined individually by optical tweezers, which are created by a laser beam aimed through a microscope and deflected into 320 spots. This upgraded version of the clock has up to 30 times as many atoms as the preliminary design unveiled last year, due mainly to the use of several different lasers, including a green one for trapping the atoms and two red ones to make them “tick.” Once the laser started atoms ticking in the experiments described in the paper, a selection of these atoms kept vibrating in unison at the same frequency for more than 30 seconds, a record for what is called quantum coherence. The large number of atoms and their long coherence times resulted in excellent clock stability of 5.2 x 10-17 at 1 second averaging time. This means that the duration of each clock “tick” matches the others to within about 1.9 quintillionths of a second."</em> <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2020/12/jilas-bigger-and-better-tweezer-clock-super-stable">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers from Trinity have shed new light on the formation mechanisms of a rare earth-bearing mineral that is in increasingly high demand across the globe for its use in the green energy and tech industries. Their discovery has important economic implications because there are no substitute alternatives to these rare earth elements (REEs), which are indispensable due to their ability to form small and very powerful magnets essential for smart devices and low-carbon energy generation (e.g., electronics, wind turbines, hybrid cars). Most REEs are exploited in carbonatite deposits (the largest known carbonatite is the Bayan Obo in China), but scientists still debate how and why they form due to their complicated mineralogy, element composition and geologic history. There are more than 250 known REE-bearing minerals, but only three are economically viable and exploited commercially. Bastnäsite is likely the primary valuable mineral for REEs in the world and was the focus of the Trinity team’s study. By considering how water containing REEs interacted with calcite, a mineral that is ubiquitous in nature and often present in hydrothermal environments, the team discovered a new pathway by which bastnäsite formed."</em> <a href="https://www.tcd.ie/Geology/news/2020/rare-mineral.php">[...]</a>

In 2019, Google's research team made a major breakthrough when their quantum computer managed to solve a task far more quickly than the world's best supercomputer. The downside is that the solved task had no practical use whatsoever – it was chosen because it was judged to be easy to solve for a quantum computer, yet very difficult for a conventional computer.

<p><em>"While many cities and eight states have banned single-use plastics, bags and other polyethylene packaging still clog landfills and pollute rivers and oceans. One major problem with recycling polyethylene, which makes up one-third of all plastic production worldwide, is economic: Recycled bags end up in low-value products, such as decks and construction material, providing little incentive to reuse the waste. A new chemical process developed at the University of California, Berkeley, converts polyethylene plastic into a strong and more valuable adhesive and could change that calculus. “The vision is that you would take a plastic bag that is of no value, and instead of throwing it away, where it ends up in a landfill, you would turn it into something of high value,” said John Hartwig, the Henry Rapoport Chair in Organic Chemistry at UC Berkeley and leader of the research team. “You couldn’t take all of this recycled plastic — hundreds of billions of pounds of polyethylene are produced each year — and turn it into a material with adhesive properties, but if you take some fraction of that and turn it into something that is of high value, that can change the economics of turning the rest of it into something that is of lower value.” For most plastics, recycling means chopping it up and forming it into generic products, in the process tossing out many of the properties painstakingly engineered into the original plastic, such as pliability and ease of processing. And while new methods of recycling can break down plastics into their chemical constituents for use as fuels or lubricants, these products, too, are low-value and can be environmentally questionable — another fossil fuel to burn — or have a short lifetime."</em> <a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/12/17/upcycling-turning-plastic-bags-into-adhesives/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Super-fast quantum computers and communication devices could revolutionize countless aspects of our lives — but first, researchers need a fast, efficient source of the entangled pairs of photons such systems use to transmit and manipulate information. Researchers at Stevens Institute of Technology have done just that, not only creating a chip-based photon source 100 times more efficient that previously possible, but bringing massive quantum device integration within reach. “It’s long been suspected that this was possible in theory, but we’re the first to show it in practice,” said Yuping Huang, Gallagher associate professor of physics and director of the Center for Quantum Science and Engineering. To create photon pairs, researchers trap light in carefully sculpted nanoscale microcavities; as light circulates in the cavity, its photons resonate and split into entangled pairs. But there’s a catch: at present, such systems are extremely inefficient, requiring a torrent of incoming laser light comprising hundreds of millions of photons before a single entangled photon pair will grudgingly drip out at the other end. Huang and colleagues at Stevens have now developed a new chip-based photon source that’s 100 times more efficient than any previous device, allowing the creation of tens of millions of entangled photon pairs per second from a single microwatt-powered laser beam."</em> <a href="https://www.stevens.edu/news/stevens-researchers-create-entangled-photons-100-times-more-efficiently-previously-possible">[...]</a>

Phenomena related to synchronization allow the group to create very simple networks that generate complex rhythmic patterns. “These networks, CPGs, are the basis of legged locomotion everywhere within nature,” he said."</em> <a href="https://publishing.aip.org/publications/latest-content/chaotic-way-to-create-insectlike-gaits-for-robots/">[...]</a>

Terahertz, a frequency range located between microwaves and infrared light, can transit much more data than current, radio-based wireless systems.

Facing the emergence of technologies such as self-driving cars and augmented reality applications, the terahertz band presents an opportunity for engineers seeking ways to increase data transmission rates.

<p><em>"Optics researchers from The University of Queensland and Nokia Bell Labs in the US have developed a new technique to demonstrate the time reversal of optical waves, which could transform the fields of advanced biomedical imaging and telecommunications. Time reversal of waves in physics doesn’t mean travelling back to the future; it describes a special type of wave which can retrace a path backwards through an object, as if watching a movie of the travelling wave, played in reverse. UQ’s Dr Mickael Mounaix and Dr Joel Carpenter, together with Dr Nick Fontaine’s team at Nokia Bell Labs, are the first to demonstrate this time reversal of optical waves, using a new device they developed that allows full 3D control of light through an optical fibre. “Imagine launching a short pulse of light from a tiny spot through some scattering material, like fog,” Dr Mounaix said. “The light starts at a single location in space and at a single point in time but becomes scattered as it travels through the fog and arrives on the other side at many different locations at many different times. “We have found a way to precisely measure where all that scattered light arrives and at what times, then create a ‘backwards’ version of that light, and send it back through the fog."</em> <a href="https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2020/12/physicists-create-time-reversed-optical-waves">[...]</a>

To accomplish this, the group headed by Prof. Steve Albrecht investigated physical processes at the interfaces to improve the transport of the charge carriers. Solar cells consisting of two semiconductors with differing band gaps can achieve considerably higher efficiencies when used in tandem compared to the individual cells on their own. This is because tandem cells use the solar spectrum more efficiently.

<p><em>"Pyramid Levitation System - How it works: The Pyramid Levitator uses two Piezo ultrasonic transmitting speakers pointing towards each other. The opposing beams of 40kHz sound waves create what's called standing waves and pressure nodes. Small items will levitate at those pressure nodes due to the acoustic radiation pressure. Acoustic radiation pressure is the physical pressure that a sound wave can exert on a surface, in this case balancing the pull of gravity and causing levitation. In the picture is a piece of styrofoam being levitated. The Pyramid has an LED on top that slowly changes colors and illuminates the floating objects.There are no magnets, just ultrasonic sound to do the levitating."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Pyramid-Levitator/">[...]</a>

Today I will show you how to make a 2-Wheel Bluetooth Controlled Car using an Arduino Nano, a 3D printer and some simple electronic components! Make sure to watch my YouTube Video to see the car in action to follow the instructions from there if you prefer! Motivation I got into basic electronics when I was 9 years old when my dad brought me some batteries, a switch and a small light bulb to play with, I was super excited. Around that time with the help of my dad I made my first ever car which was as simple as it could be."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Arduino-Bluetooth-Controlled-Car/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Programmable LED strips, e.g. based on WS2812, are fascinating. Applications are manifold and you rapidly can get impressive results. And somehow building clocks seem to be another domain which I think about a lot. Starting with some experience in building a word clock based on single LEDs, an Arduino and a digital clock module I moved to web based NTP time which is a neat component of a WLAN integrated nodemcu (ESP8622) module. Hence building a led matrix display clock out of an LED strip and a nodemcu controller is all but obvious."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/WiFi-Controlled-LED-Strip-Matrix-Display-Clock-Lig/">[...]</a>

Similarly the Solar Power Plants will be kilometer long and every solar panel uses brushes needs to be cleaned once in a while.
