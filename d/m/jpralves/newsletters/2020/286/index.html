<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1881, o físico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_Davisson">Clinton Davisson</a>. Ele dividiu o Prémio Nobel de Física em 1937 (com o inglês George P. Thomson) por descobrir que os electrões podem ser difractados como ondas de luz, verificando assim a tese de Louis de Broglie de que os electrões comportam-se tanto como ondas assim como partículas. Davisson estudou o efeito do bombardeamento de electrões em superfícies e observou que o ângulo de reflexão pode depender da orientação do cristal. Seguindo a teoria de Louis de Broglie da natureza ondulatória das partículas, ele percebeu que os seus resultados poderiam ser devidos à difracção de electrões pelo padrão dos átomos na superfície do cristal. Davisson trabalhou com Lester Germer numa experiência na qual electrões ricocheteando numa superfície de níquel produziram padrões de onda semelhantes aos formados pela luz reflectida numa rede de difracção e apoiando o comprimento de onda do electrão de Broglie. Esta descoberta foi aplicada ao estudo da estrutura nuclear, atómica e molecular. Davisson ajudou a desenvolver o microscópio electrónico que usa a natureza de onda dos electrões para ver detalhes mais pequenos que o comprimento de onda da luz visível.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1902, o químico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Spedding">Frank Spedding</a>. Ele desenvolveu processos de redução de elementos individuais de terras raras ao estado metálico a baixo custo, tornando assim essas substâncias disponíveis para a indústria a preços razoáveis. Anteriormente, após a descoberta da fissão nuclear em 1939, o governo dos Estados Unidos pediu aos principais cientistas que se unissem ao desenvolvimento da energia nuclear. Em 1942, Frank H. Spedding do Iowa State College, um especialista em química de terras raras, concordou em estabelecer a parte Ames do Projecto Manhattan, tendo como resultado um procedimento fácil e barato para produzir urânio de alta qualidade.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1905, o engenheiro electrotécnico norte-american <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Guthe_Jansky">Karl Guthe Jansky</a>. Ele descobriu as emissões de rádio cósmicas em 1932. Nos laboratórios Bell em NJ, Jansky estava a seguir os ruídos crepitantes de estática que atormentavam a recepção de telefone no exterior. Ele descobriu que certas ondas de rádio vinham de uma região específica do céu a cada 23 horas e 56 minutos, da direcção de Sagitário em direcção ao centro da Via Láctea. Na publicação do seus resultados, ele sugeriu que a emissão de rádio estava de alguma forma ligada à Via Láctea e que provinha não de estrelas, mas de gás interestelar ionizado. Aos 26 anos, Jansky fez uma descoberta histórica - que os corpos celestes podiam emitir ondas de rádio assim como ondas de luz.</p>

<p>Foi a 22 de Outubro de 1879 que a longa série de experiências de Edison a testar materiais como filamento de luz eléctrica chegou a um ponto crítico. Charles Batchelor, a trabalhar no laboratório de Edison em Menlo Park, produziu iluminação durante 14 horas e meia a partir de uma lâmpada usando um fio de algodão carbonizado. Ela falhou quando foi adicionada energia extra. No entanto, esta foi uma melhoria tão substancial, que a atenção se voltou para melhorar o filamento carbonizado. As patentes foram registadas e, em dois meses, o progresso com a lâmpada Edison foi tornado público. Um artigo foi publicado em 21 de Dezembro pelo New York Herald. Nessa altura, o laboratório de Menlo Park estava permanentemente iluminado pelas lâmpadas incandescentes de Edison.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou foi lançada a versão 20.10 da Distro de Linux Ubuntu. Esta Distro é criada pela Canonical e esta versão tem como principais novidades o GNOME 3.38, o Kernel Linux 5.8, o GCC 10 e o Python 3.8. Esta é a primeira versão que suporta oficialmente o Raspberry PI 4.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou a sonda OSIRIS-REx entrou em contacto com o asteróide Bennu e fez recolha de amostras. Este momento foi muito celebrado uma vez que este é o quarto ano desta missão e este é um ponto crucial da mesma. A sonda agora deverá regressar à Terra e chegar daqui a três anos, em 2023.</p>

<p>Nesta semana foi também apresentada pela fundação Raspberry PI a versão SOM (system-on-module) do Raspberry PI 4. Esta versão apresenta uma grande novidade relativamente às anteriores - deixou de usar os conectores do tipo JEDEC DDR2 e passou a usar um conector de alta densidade. Construído com o mesmo processador BCM2711 quad-core de 64 bits do Raspberry Pi 4, o novo Compute Module 4 oferece uma mudança radical no desempenho em relação aos seus predecessores: núcleos de CPU mais rápidos, melhor multimédia, mais recursos de interface e, pela primeira vez, uma escolha de capacidade de RAM e uma opção de conectividade Wifi. Existem 32 variantes de onde escolher, entre as varias opções de RAM, storage eMMC e Wifi. A placa de Módulos de I/O onde se encaixa a nova SOM tem suporte para dois HDMI, Gigabit Ethernet, uma PCI Express Gen2, RTC com bateria e duas Portas USB 2.0.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos assim como projetos de maker. É apresentada a revista Hackspace Magazine Nº36 de Novembro.</p>

<h2><a href="https://news.softpedia.com/news/canonical-officially-launches-ubuntu-20-10-531398.shtml">Canonical Officially Launches Ubuntu 20.10</a></h2>

<p><em>"Ubuntu was, is, and will probably remain the leading Linux distribution out there, at least as far as the number of users is considered. And the one to thank is Canonical’s commitment to keeping Ubuntu up-to-date with the latest technologies, features, and apps out there, so the frequent OS updates that the company releases brings its platform in line with the rest of the market. Ubuntu 20.10 is the newest release that went live this week, and this time, there are massive improvements coming to users. The most important of them is the release of optimized Raspberry Pi images for desktop and servers, which according to the company, should come in handy to “learners, inventors, educators, and entrepreneurs.” While support for the Raspberry Pi has been around for a while, this is the first release that adds the pocket-size computers to the list of devices certified with Ubuntu. “In this release, we celebrate the Raspberry Pi Foundation’s commitment to put open computing in the hands of people all over the world,” said Mark Shuttleworth, CEO at Canonical. “We are honoured to support that initiative by optimising Ubuntu on the Raspberry Pi, whether for personal use, educational purposes or as a foundation for their next business venture.” All latest Raspberry Pi models are now certified with Ubuntu, as long as they come with 4GB or 8GB RAM."</em> <a href="https://news.softpedia.com/news/canonical-officially-launches-ubuntu-20-10-531398.shtml">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-osiris-rex-spacecraft-successfully-touches-asteroid">NASA’s OSIRIS-REx Spacecraft Successfully Touches Asteroid</a></h2>

<p><em>"NASA’s Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security, Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) spacecraft unfurled its robotic arm Tuesday, and in a first for the agency, briefly touched an asteroid to collect dust and pebbles from the surface for delivery to Earth in 2023. This well-preserved, ancient asteroid, known as Bennu, is currently more than 200 million miles (321 million kilometers) from Earth. Bennu offers scientists a window into the early solar system as it was first taking shape billions of years ago and flinging ingredients that could have helped seed life on Earth. If Tuesday’s sample collection event, known as “Touch-And-Go” (TAG), provided enough of a sample, mission teams will command the spacecraft to begin stowing the precious primordial cargo to begin its journey back to Earth in March 2021. Otherwise, they will prepare for another attempt in January. “This amazing first for NASA demonstrates how an incredible team from across the country came together and persevered through incredible challenges to expand the boundaries of knowledge,” said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-osiris-rex-spacecraft-successfully-touches-asteroid">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-compute-module-4/">Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 on sale now from $25</a></h2>

<p><em>"It’s become a tradition that we follow each Raspberry Pi model with a system-on-module variant based on the same core silicon. Raspberry Pi 1 gave rise to the original Compute Module in 2014; Raspberry Pi 3 and 3+ were followed by Compute Module 3 and 3+ in 2017 and 2019 respectively. Only Raspberry Pi 2, our shortest-lived flagship product at just thirteen months, escaped the Compute Module treatment. It’s been sixteen months since we unleashed Raspberry Pi 4 on the world, and today we’re announcing the launch of Compute Module 4, starting from $25. Over half of the seven million Raspberry Pi units we sell each year go into industrial and commercial applications, from digital signage to thin clients to process automation. Many of these applications use the familiar single-board Raspberry Pi, but for users who want a more compact or custom form factor, or on-board eMMC storage, Compute Module products provide a simple way to move from a Raspberry Pi-based prototype to volume production."</em> <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-compute-module-4/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Software engineers can now map applications coded in C/C++ directly into PolarFire FPGAs and SoCs that are the industry’s lowest-power mid-range fabric solutions for acceleration Microchip Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP) today announced it acquired Toronto-based LegUp Computing Inc., expanding its Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-based edge compute solution stack with a high-level synthesis (HLS) tool. Commercialized from University of Toronto research, the LegUp HLS tool will make it easier for a larger community of software engineers to harness the algorithm-accelerating power of Microchip’s PolarFire® FPGA and PolarFire System on Chip (SoC) platforms. “The LegUp team brings us deep experience in high-level synthesis and related technologies as we continue to optimize the integrated design environment tool flows for our PolarFire FPGA and PolarFire SoC customers,” said Bruce Weyer, vice president of the FPGA business unit at Microchip. “The acquisition also gives our traditional Microchip MCU and MPU clients the ability to use FPGAs as accelerators through an easy-to-use compiler that will substantially improve their design productivity and system performance while shortening their time to market.” The LegUp HLS tool will be used alongside Microchip’s VectorBlox Accelerator Software Design kit and VectorBlox Neural Networking IP generator to provide a complete front-end solution stack for C/C++ algorithm developers who want to work with PolarFire FPGA and PolarFire SoC devices without having to understand the underlying Register Transfer Level (RTL) development flows. Microchip acquired Vancouver, Canada-based VectorBlox Computing in August 2019 to enhance its portfolio of solutions for edge compute applications. “Software engineers needing hardware acceleration demand performance and power efficiency, while looking for tools that enable higher levels of abstraction for the hardware that will implement their compute-intensive algorithms,” said Andrew Canis, CEO of LegUp Computing, now part of Microchip."</em> <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en/pressreleasepage/microchip-acquires-high-level-synthesis-tool-provider-legup">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://toshiba.semicon-storage.com/ap-en/company/news/news-topics/2020/10/mosfet-20201019-1.html">Toshiba Launches 1200V Silicon Carbide MOSFET that Contributes to High-efficiency Power Supply</a></h2>

<p><em>"Toshiba Electronic Devices &amp; Storage Corporation (“Toshiba”) has launched “TW070J120B,” a 1200V silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFET for industrial applications that include large capacity power supply. Shipments start today. The power MOSFET using the SiC, a new material, achieves high voltage resistance, high-speed switching, and low On-resistance compared to conventional silicon (Si) MOSFET, IGBT products.

The mi.1 Cable wirelessly connects two MIDI instruments, while the Mi.1 II is used to wirelessly connect a MIDI instrument to a smartphone. MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a technical standard that describes a communications protocol, digital interface, and electrical connectors that connect a wide variety of electronic musical instruments, computers, and related audio devices for playing, editing and recording music. Designed to replace a traditional wired MIDI cable, the mi.1 Cable is said to be the world’s first Bluetooth MIDI pair of wireless adaptors that does not require a separate battery to operate because its low power consumption enables it to take its power directly from the small amount of current flowing through the MIDI ports. MIDI over Bluetooth LE Supported by the Nordic SoC-based Insight SiP ‘ISP1507-AX’ RF module, the device provides MIDI over Bluetooth LE between, for example, the MIDI instrument such as a MIDI keyboard, a MIDI controller, and a MIDI tone generator.

In everyday life, you can safely use a hair dryer or toaster without knowing exactly how many electrons are flowing through it every second. But researchers on the frontiers of physics must have a precise definition of the ampere to detect when experiments unexpectedly deviate from theoretical predictions. “As technology progresses, lots of measurements that we could not do before become available, and then you can have extremely high-precision measurements,” said Fermilab scientist Javier Tiffenberg. “So you want to have a definition of the unit that is much more precise than whatever you are trying to measure.” For decades, scientists have struggled to achieve the necessary precision for the ampere."</em> <a href="https://news.fnal.gov/2020/10/pinning-down-the-ampere-with-a-supersensitive-particle-detector/">[...]</a>

In the process, however, energy is wasted; a typical car only converts around 25 percent of the energy in gasoline into useful energy to make it run. Engines that run with 100 percent efficiency are still more science fiction than science fact, but new research from the University of Rochester may bring scientists one step closer to demonstrating an ideal transfer of energy within a system.

<p><em>"You probably already know that placing a pared apple in saltwater prevents it from turning black from oxidation, but do you also know that saltwater can also be used to protect fragile quantum dot material? A research team led by Prof. Sean Chen of the Department of Materials Science and Engineering has recently developed the world’s first quantum dot material using saltwater as a coating, which not only resists water and oxygen corrosion, but can also be uniformly printed as a micro LED on flexible plastic film for use in high-resolution mobile phones, glasses, etc. The team’s research has been published in a recent issue of ACS Applied Materials &amp; InterfacesACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces, and the material they have developed is currently being patented in the United States and Taiwan. Eager to develop displays which are high-resolution, high-brightness, ultra-thin, flexible, and long-life for use in the goggles used in augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), and for watches and other wearable electronic devices, Apple, Samsung and other major panel manufacturers have invested heavily in the research and development of micro LEDs to replace the current OLEDs. But arranging millions of LED dots less than 100 microns in size onto a substrate is no easy task. According to Chen, many manufacturers use a stamping method to move millions of red, green, and blue micro LEDs one by one to the substrate, but if a few small dots don’t stick, the screen will be marred by dead pixels."</em> <a href="http://nthu-en.site.nthu.edu.tw/p/404-1003-187860.php">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This highly compact beam forming network has been designed for multi-beam satellite payload antennas. Generating a total of 64 signal beams outputted from a single antenna, this novel design could cover the entire Earth with multiple spot beams from geostationary orbit. “The traditional solution for a multibeam telecommunications satellite payload would be a single feed per signal beam, but only a limited number of feeds are able to be accommodated in front of the satellite antenna, with each feed requiring a dedicated amplifier,” explains Petar Jankovic of ESA’s Radio Frequency Equipment and Technology section. “This is a highly integrated, lower mass alternative, developed with Airbus in Italy.” What looks like a sunburst design is actually a ‘Rotman’ lens, laid down on a printed circuit board, used to direct and focus microwaves. These are commonly employed in terrestrial radar systems, for instance aboard high-end drones or in-car radar, and are also being looked at for future 5G base stations. A single flat Rotman lens allows beam scanning along a single axis."</em> <a href="https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2020/10/Microwave_lenses_harnessed_for_multi-beam_forming">[...]</a>

While much of these objects can be freely designed and quickly made, the addition of electronics to embed things like sensors, chips, and tags usually requires that you design both separately, making it difficult to create items where the added functions are easily integrated with the form. Now, a 3D design environment from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) lets users iterate an object’s shape and electronic function in one cohesive space, to add existing sensors to early-stage prototypes. The team tested the system, called MorphSensor, by modeling an N95 mask with a humidity sensor, a temperature-sensing ring, and glasses that monitor light absorption to protect eye health.

Landauer is known for the mantra “Information is Physical”, which reminds us that information is not abstract and is encoded on physical hardware. The “bit” is the currency of information (it can be either 0 or 1) and Landauer discovered that when a bit is erased there is a minimum amount of heat released.

The answer is an effect from Einstein's General Theory of Relativity called the "gravitational redshift," where light is shifted to redder colors because of gravity. Using NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, astronomers have discovered the phenomenon in two stars orbiting each other in our galaxy about 29,000 light years (200,000 trillion miles) away from Earth. While these stars are very distant, gravitational redshifts have tangible impacts on modern life, as scientists and engineers must take them into account to enable accurate positions for GPS. While scientists have found incontrovertible evidence of gravitational redshifts in our solar system, it has been challenging to observe them in more distant objects across space.

So I'll be documenting the whole process here, from PCB design to programming the microcontroller. 1. Circuit Schematic and PCB Design The first step was choosing the microcontroller I was going to use, based on the functionalities I wanted my violin to have. I needed at least one PWM pin for the piezoelectric buzzer and another two digital pins for the LEDs and for the push-button, so the ATtiny85 turned out to be the perfect fit.

Although watering houseplants is an everyday task that most of us have not taken an interest in and therefore it is struggling to discern its effect on sustainable water supplies, repetitive water overuse adds up to tons of liters of water. To aid this problem, I decided to create a device that tracks the total water discharged while watering houseplants, evaluates the approximate evaporation rates by using temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, and lets the user observe soil moisture and altitude.

So, after I got a 3D in September, I worked through several simple designs in TinkerCAD and felt like I was ready to tackle something a little more difficult. There may have been easier ways to do what I did, but the "ungrouped" image from TinkerCAD shows the number of objects required to create the monitor section. The tools, software and materials needed for this project are: Ender 3 pro 3D printer (or any 3D printer) Cura (or your favorite slicer) TinkerCAD (I used this as it was free and had a easy learning curve) Gray PLA 1.75 mm filament (any color will do, but the original in the show was a shade of gray) #4 x 3/8" sheet metal cap screw (Phillips head) Phillips screw driver And of course an Apple Watch and charger.

In the first case, the stations are selected manually using a rotary encoder which in this case simulates a variable capacitor. Also, in the code, we can redefine known radio station frequencies which we can select then by pressing the rotary encoder switch."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/mircemk/diy-retro-look-fm-radio-with-linear-scale-f14ca2">[...]</a>

The sensitivity is not enough for treasure-hunting, but it can be made into a small hand-held device that is very useful indoors to check for the presence of metals. It will help you find nails inside wood or heating pipes in the wall, and to check the composition of tools and furniture. The method can also be used to integrate as a sensor, integrated with more elaborate projects.

<p><em>"This is a story about failure and how I managed to iterate on the design process so I can fix my mistakes. For some time now, I wanted to make a boat that I can use on my fishing trips where I can use this boat to pull the fishing line out on the water, beyond what I can cast by throwing and to also serve as a feeder boat to bring in extra food to the cast place for when catching carp. When thinking about the design of the boat, I chose to make an airboat because the lake where I usually go fishing has a lot of grass growing in the shallow water, so any propeller or anything else sticking out of the bottom will become tangled and the boat can get stuck. Below are the two videos of the entire process. The first one is the initial making that at the end did not work as expected but then after fixing the issues, the boat worked perfectly even while carrying a lot of weight.

When the user presses the start button, the automaton will start, cycle through the presentation, then stop automatically using this mechanism. I wrote a Python script for the Autodesk Fusion 360 "Add-Ins" menu in order to generate a hypocycloidal "sketch" curve based on pin count and pin diameter. From this curve I can easily create a cycloidal disk and plate. Thus the Python script allows me to easily adjust the input to output ratio and size of the cycloidal mechanism in order to synchronize the running time of an automaton with its presentation, all within a much smaller space than before. For this mechanism, I designed the cycloidal disk and plate for a ten to one input to output ratio, meaning the large gear will turn ten times before the cycloidal disk turns one time, at which point the mechanism stops."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Cycloidal-Disk-Mechanical-Timer/">[...]</a>
