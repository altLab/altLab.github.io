<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1682, o matemático e inventor britânico <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hadley">John Hadley</a>. Ele aperfeiçoou os métodos de rectificação e polimento de lentes telescópicas. Hadley melhorou o telescópio reflector (introduzido pela primeira vez por Newton em 1668) e produziu o primeiro deste tipo com precisão e potência suficientes para serem úteis na astronomia. Tinha um espelho de 6 polegadas. Ele também é conhecido pelo octante reflectivo (1730) usado no mar para medir a altitude do Sol ou de um corpo celeste acima do horizonte, dentro de um segundo do arco. Era o ancestral do sextante náutico moderno.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1838, o químico industrial belga <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Solvay">Ernest Solvay</a>. Ele inventou o Processo Solvay (1863), um processo comercialmente viável de amónia-soda para a produção de carbonato de sódio, amplamente utilizado na fabricação de produtos como o vidro e o sabão. Embora meio século antes, A.J. Fresnel tinha mostrado (1811) que o bicarbonato de sódio podia ser precipitado a partir de uma solução salina contendo bicarbonato de amónio; muitos obstáculos de engenharia precisavam ser ultrapassados. O projecto bem-sucedido de Solvay usava uma torre de carbonatação de alta eficiência e 80 pés de altura, na qual salmoura amonizada escorria de cima e dióxido de carbono subia do fundo. Placas e tampas de bolhas ajudaram a criar uma superfície maior sobre a qual os dois poderiam reagir, formando bicarbonato de sódio.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1850, o metalúrgico e inventor britânico <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Gilchrist_Thomas">Sidney Gilchrist Thomas</a>. Ele desenvolveu com seu primo Percy Gilchrist, o processo Thomas-Gilchrist que elimina a impureza do fósforo de certos minérios de ferro no conversor Bessemer. O fósforo faz com que o aço seja frágil e de pouca utilidade. No entanto, a maioria dos minérios de ferro de fontes britânicas, francesas, alemãs e belgas era fosfórico. Thomas concebeu a ideia de incorporar cal (ou magnésia ou calcário magnesiano com propriedades químicas básicas semelhantes), como revestimento do conversor Bessemer. Gilchrist, químico industrial de uma grande indústria siderúrgica, confirmou essa ideia em 4 de Abril de 1879. Thomas registou uma patente em 1878. Até a escória de resíduos era lucrativa para a indústria de fertilizantes artificiais.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1867, inventor e aviador americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_brothers">Wilbur Wright</a>. Ele com o seu irmão Orville, inventou o primeiro avião a motor, Flyer, capaz de voo controlado e sustentado (17 de Dezembro de 1903). Orville fez o primeiro voo, no ar por 12 segundos. Wilbur fez o segundo voo, cobrindo 260 m em 85 segundos. Em 1905, eles tinham melhorado o desenho, construído e realizado vários vos longos no Flyer III, que foi o primeiro avião totalmente prático (1905), capaz de voar até 38 minutos e viajar 39 km. O modelo A foi produzido em 1908, capaz de voar durante mais de duas horas.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1894, o matemático russo-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerzy_Neyman">Jerzy Neyman</a>. Ele foi um dos principais arquitectos da estatística teórica moderna. Os seus trabalhos sobre testes de hipóteses (1928-33) ajudaram a estabelecer o assunto. Durante 1934-38, ele deu uma teoria dos intervalos de confiança (importante na análise de dados); teoria estatística estendida a distribuições contagiosas (para interpretação de dados biológicos); escreveu sobre amostragem de populações estratificadas (o que levou a aplicações como a Pesquisa Gallup); e desenvolveu o modelo para experiências aleatórias (amplamente relevantes nos campos da ciência, incluindo agricultura, biologia, medicina e ciências físicas). As suas pesquisas posteriores aplicaram estatísticas à meteorologia e à medicina. Em 1968, ele foi premiado com a prestigiada Medalha Nacional da Ciência.</p>

<p><em>"A team of transatlantic scientists, using reanalyzed data from NASA’s Kepler space telescope, has discovered an Earth-size exoplanet orbiting in its star's habitable zone, the area around a star where a rocky planet could support liquid water. Scientists discovered this planet, called Kepler-1649c, when looking through old observations from Kepler, which the agency retired in 2018. While previous searches with a computer algorithm misidentified it, researchers reviewing Kepler data took a second look at the signature and recognized it as a planet. Out of all the exoplanets found by Kepler, this distant world – located 300 light-years from Earth – is most similar to Earth in size and estimated temperature. This newly revealed world is only 1.06 times larger than our own planet. Also, the amount of starlight it receives from its host star is 75% of the amount of light Earth receives from our Sun – meaning the exoplanet's temperature may be similar to our planet’s, as well."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/earth-size-habitable-zone-planet-found-hidden-in-early-nasa-kepler-data">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news/intel-qutech-demonstrate-high-fidelity-hot-qubits-practical-quantum-systems/">Intel and QuTech Demonstrate High-Fidelity ‘Hot’ Qubits for Practical Quantum Systems</a></h2>

<p><em>"Intel, in collaboration with QuTech, today published a paper in Nature demonstrating the successful control of “hot” qubits, the fundamental unit of quantum computing, at temperatures greater than 1 kelvin. The research also highlighted individual coherent control of two qubits with single-qubit fidelities of up to 99.3%. These breakthroughs highlight the potential for cryogenic controls of a future quantum system and silicon spin qubits, which closely resemble a single electron transistor, to come together in an integrated package. “This research represents a meaningful advancement in our research into silicon spin qubits, which we believe are promising candidates for powering commercial-scale quantum systems, given their resemblance to transistors that Intel has been manufacturing for more than 50 years. Our demonstration of hot qubits that can operate at higher temperatures while maintaining high fidelity paves the way to allow a variety of local qubit control options without impacting qubit performance.” –Jim Clarke, director of quantum hardware, Intel Labs Why It’s Important: Applying quantum computing to practical problems hinges on the ability to scale to and control thousands – if not millions – of qubits at the same time with high levels of fidelity. However, current quantum systems designs are limited by overall system size, qubit fidelity and especially the complexity of control electronics required to manage the quantum at large scale."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news/intel-qutech-demonstrate-high-fidelity-hot-qubits-practical-quantum-systems/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A team of National Science Foundation-supported researchers at Northern Illinois University and the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado, report in the journal Nature on a potential breakthrough in the development of hybrid perovskite solar cells. Perovskite solar cells convert light into electricity and are potentially cheaper and simpler to produce than traditional silicon-based solar cells. But the top-performing hybrid perovskite solar cells typically contain lead, raising concerns over its potential leakage from damaged cells. Led by Tao Xu of NIU and Kai Zhu of NREL, the team has developed a technique to sequester the lead in perovskite solar cells, minimizing potential toxic leakage. A transparent lead-absorbing film is applied to a conducting glass on the front of the solar cell. The sequestration film contains strong, lead-binding phosphonic acid groups but does not hinder cell capture of light."</em> <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?org=NSF&amp;cntn_id=300084&amp;preview=false">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://grainger.illinois.edu/news/36397">New measurements reveal evidence of elusive particles in a newly-discovered superconductor</a></h2>

<p><em>"Particle chasing—it’s a game that so many physicists play. Sometimes the hunt takes place inside large supercolliders, where spectacular collisions are necessary to find hidden particles and new physics. For physicists studying solids, the game occurs in a much different environment and the sought-after particles don’t come from furious collisions. Instead, particle-like entities, called quasiparticles, emerge from complicated electronic interactions that happen deep within a material. Sometimes the quasiparticles are easy to probe, but others are more difficult to spot, lurking just out of reach. Now a team of researchers at the University of Illinois, led by physicist Vidya Madhavan, in collaboration with researchers from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the University of Maryland, Boston College, and ETH Zurich, have used high-resolution microscopy tools to peer at the inner-workings of an unusual type of superconductor, uranium ditelluride (UTe2)."</em> <a href="https://grainger.illinois.edu/news/36397">[...]</a>

<p><em>"How do you detect a particle that has almost no mass, feels only two of the four fundamental forces, and can travel unhindered through solid lead for an entire light-year without ever interacting with matter? This is the problem posed by neutrinos, ghostly particles that are generated in the trillions by nuclear reactions in stars, including our sun, and on Earth. Scientists can also produce neutrinos to study in controlled experiments using particle accelerators. One of the ways neutrinos can be detected is with large vats filled with liquid argon and wrapped with a complex web of integrated circuitry that can operate in temperatures colder than the average day on Neptune. Industry does not typically use electronics that operate at cryogenic temperatures, so particle physicists have had to engineer their own. A collaboration of several Department of Energy national labs, including Fermilab, has been developing prototypes of the electronics that will ultimately be used in the international Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment, called DUNE, hosted by Fermilab."</em> <a href="https://news.fnal.gov/2020/04/the-cold-eyes-of-dune/">[...]</a>

MIT researchers have designed a congestion-control scheme for wireless networks that could help reduce lag times and increase quality in video streaming, video chat, mobile gaming, and other web services. To keep web services running smoothly, congestion-control schemes infer information about a network’s bandwidth capacity and congestion based on feedback from the network routers, which is encoded in data packets. That information determines how fast data packets are sent through the network. Deciding a good sending rate can be a tough balancing act. Senders don’t want to be overly conservative: If a network’s capacity constantly varies from, say, 2 megabytes per second to 500 kilobytes per second, the sender could always send traffic at the lowest rate."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2020/reducing-delays-wireless-networks-csail-0410">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scientists at the University of South Florida have reached a new milestone in the development of two-dimensional supramolecules – the building blocks that make areas of nanotechnology and nanomaterial advancement possible. Since the 2004 discovery of graphene, the world’s thinnest (one atom thick) and strongest (200 times stronger than steel) material, researchers have been working to further develop similar nanomaterials for industrial, pharmaceutical and other commercial uses. Thanks to its conductive properties and strength, graphene can be used in microelectronics to fortify mechanical materials and has recently enabled precise 3D imaging of nanoparticles. While work to develop new supramolecules capable of further applications has seen some success, those molecular formations are either small – less than 10 nanometers in size – or arbitrarily assemble, limiting their potential use. But now, new research published in "Nature Chemistry," outlines a profound leap forward in supramolecular progress. “Our research team has been able to overcome one of the major supramolecular obstacles, developing a well-defined supramolecular structure that pushes the 20-nanometer scale,” said Xiaopeng Li, an associate professor in the USF Department of Chemistry and the study’s lead researcher."</em> <a href="https://www.usf.edu/news/2020/pushing-the-limits-of-2d-supramolecules.aspx">[...]</a>

Therefore we will instead focus what we've learned from building "Fetch", which traps you should avoid, and which details you should pay the most attention to - as well as some tips and tricks for handling ferrofluid in general. The team behind this project is currently discussing options for making a smaller, more affordable, ferrofluid-display for more realistic replication by hobbyists.

Instead of using individual LEDs with another controller, I have used RGB LED strips with individual ICs on each of them, connected into 8 columns of 6 LEDs. Not only does this make the matrix bigger, it also allows us to use CRGB colors instead of just one color. *Note: I know the code can be simplified if the LEDs are all chained together, but I wanted to try something new, so I separated the LED strips into 8 strips of 6. * Sources: Original Project: https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-5X3-LED-Matrix-to-Run-Alphabets/ CRGB colors: https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/wiki/Pixel-reference You will need: Jumper wires: these are needed to connect the LED matrix to the circuit board so you can control it.

<p><em>"A couple of months ago I built a two digit mechanical 7 segment display which I turned into a countdown timer. It came out quite well and a number of people suggested doubling up on the display to make a clock. The problem was that I was already running out of PWM IO on my Arduino Mega and didn't have enough available for the second or third digits. I was then pointed in the direction of these PCA9685 16 channel PWM drivers which operates over an I2C interface. These made it possible to drive the 28 servos I needed all using the two I2C pins on an Arduino. So I got to work building a clock which now uses a DS1302 real time clock module to keep the time and two 16 channel servo drivers to control the 28 servos used to make up the display, all powered by an Arduino Uno."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Mechanical-Seven-Segment-Display-Clock/">[...]</a>

This project uses very few materials and is very simple to make. My soldering and design skills are quite mediocre, I just began electronics as a hobby so bare with me. I had a few old phone batteries lying around and they are still capable of holding about 65% charge so its good enough for this project, the lithium ion battery in this project can also be replaced by a suitable AA or AAA or even a 9V battery, you only need to change the resistors accordingly. If you were having my exact thoughts at this moment you would have realised that as voltage of the batteries reduces the brightness of the light also decreases gradually (like i mentioned earlier crappy design), I could probably add a constant current / constant voltage design later. I used 10 ohm resistors as that is what i had, the led's that I have used are 5730 normal white which are rated at 3V and 150ma(max), the resistors in this design are not the most suitable for these LED but for my need it was not required to be on max current and also at max currents these led's last much shorter, so at max battery voltage of about 4.1V I get 110ma and at about 3.7V I still get about 70ma per LED which is half its brightness."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Simple-Pocket-Light/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Any workshop must have a good lab power supply. Somehow it happened that a PC power supply was always enough for me. But when power was needed at 30, 40 and 50 Volts, the situation slightly changed. After a short two-month deliberation, the DPS5015 module was ordered. This unit is rated at a maximum of 50 Volts and 15 Amperes. And this post is about how this Chinese module turned into a compact, mobile and pretty cute laboratory power supply unit with the ability to connect an additional external power source."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Simple-and-Small-Programmable-Lab-Power-Supply/">[...]</a>

After the Pythagotron which is a single stringed bass roboter, this is my first attempt to combine three string units to make a polyphonic instrument. Pitch actuators While the Pythagotron features a motor driven carriage which shortens the string to the desired pitch by sliding up and down, for Greg’s Harp I came up with the concept of motorized frets. They make quick changes between chords possible. Since every moFret needs a dedicated servo and driver, we tried to keep the number of needed moFrets low but still enough to allow for playing every possible triad (e.g. c-minor in at least one inversion)."</em> <a href="https://frankpiesik.wordpress.com/2020/04/02/gregs-harp/">[...]</a>

So, without further ado, let's get started! For this project, you will need: An Arduino microcontroller board A PS/2 touchpad from a laptop(Try to get one with a Synaptics chip onboard) *A ULN2003 stepper motor driver(For unipolar stepper motors(5-wire)) *An L298N stepper motor driver(For bipolar stepper motors(4-wire)) 6 male to female jumper wires(2 for power and 4 for digital signals) A stepper motor A 5-12 volt DC power source(Depending on the stepper motor) Here, the setup is powered from a mobile phone charger that supplies 5-volts to the Arduino board and the stepper driver. Even though the stepper motor is rated for 12-volt, you can use a lower voltage supply if the torque requirements of the motor are not high because using a lower voltage supply will keep the motor as well as the driver cooler."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Reuse-Old-Laptops-Touchpad-to-Control-a-Stepper-Mo/">[...]</a>
