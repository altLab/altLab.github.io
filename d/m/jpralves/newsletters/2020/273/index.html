<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1886, o físico alemão, nascido na Suíça <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_H._Schottky">Walter H. Schottky</a>. Ele fez pesquisas em física do estado sólido que levaram ao desenvolvimento de vários dispositivos electrónicos. Ele descobriu o efeito Schottky, uma irregularidade na emissão de termiões num tubo de vácuo e inventou o tubo de tetrodo de grade de tela (1915). O díodo Schottky é um díodo de alta velocidade com muito pouca capacitância de junção (também conhecido como "díodo portador quente" ou "díodo de barreira de superfície".) Ele usa uma junção metal-semicondutora como barreira Schottky, em vez do semicondutor junção semicondutora de um díodo convencional.</p>

<p>Também faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1906, o químico suíço-jugoslavo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Prelog">Vladimir Prelog</a>. Ele partilhou o Prémio Nobel de Química de 1975 com John W. Cornforth pelo seu trabalho na estereoquímica de moléculas e reacções orgânicas. Estereoquímica é o estudo dos arranjos tridimensionais de átomos dentro de moléculas. Ele foi o autor de regras sistemáticas de nomenclatura para moléculas e sua versão de imagem espelhada, ou seja, qual configuração será chamada de "dextra" e qual será o "levo" (direita ou esquerda). Além disso, por difracção de raios X, ele elucidou a estrutura de vários antibióticos.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1952, o cientista da computação e visionário americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Weiser">Mark Weiser</a>. Ele foi o director de tecnologia da XEROX PARC, e é lembrado por ter desenvolvido a ideia pioneira do que ele chamou de "computação omnipresente". Ele cunhou esse termo em 1988 para descrever um futuro em que computadores pessoais serão substituídos por pequenos computadores embutidos em dispositivos "inteligentes" do quotidiano (itens do quotidiano, como cafeteiras e copiadoras) e sua conexão via rede. Ele disse: “Primeiro, os mainframes, cada um partilhado por muitas pessoas. Agora estamos na era da computação pessoal, pessoa e máquina observando-se inquietas na área de trabalho. Em seguida, vem a computação omnipresente, ou a era da tecnologia calma, quando a tecnologia retrocede para o fundo de nossas vidas.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou, foram enviados para o espaço em direcção a Marte dois foguetões. O primeiro foi lançado no passado domingo num foguetão Japonês uma sonda robótica dos Emirados Árabes Unidos. Esta viagem terá a duração de cerca de 7 meses até chegar a Marte.</p>

<p>Hoje, foi lançado pela China a sua mais ambiciosa missão a Marte, numa tentativa de pousar com sucesso uma sonda no planeta vermelho, feito alcançado apenas pelos Estados Unidos até à data. A Tianwen-1, é composta por uma sonda e por um rover equipados com instrumentos de recolha de dados. Os objectivos da missão são a exploração do solo marciano, procurando perceber a distribuição de água gelada do planeta e a composição da sua superfície, assim como do seu clima e atmosfera.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos assim como projetos de maker. É apresentada a revista HackSpace Magazine Nº 33 de Agosto.</p>

<p><em>"The United Arab Emirates is on its way to Mars, claiming the title of first Arab country to launch an interplanetary mission, which it designed and built in just six years and dubbed Hope. The Hope Mars orbiter launched toward Mars on a Japanese rocket on Sunday (July 19). Its name was carefully chosen to reflect the country's goal for the mission, which focused as on spurring space exploration and science in the UAE as on actually reaching the Red Planet. But like the name of NASA's own Mars mission launching this month, the Hope name has taken on a new resonance over the past months as the world navigates the throes of the coronavirus pandemic, which complicated launch preparations for both Mars missions. Nevertheless, both spacecraft made it to their rockets in time for the rare three-week launch window to the Red Planet. "Whether it's the Mars Perseverance mission or the Mars Hope mission, all of us believe that this is critical for our nations to inspire the next generation, to provide hope, and demonstrate perseverance," NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine said during a webcast held before launch."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/hope-mars-mission-uae-apollo-moment.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The six-wheeled robot, encapsulated in a protective probe, was lifted off Earth by a Long March 5 rocket from the Wenchang spaceport on Hainan Island at 12:40 local time (04:40 GMT). It should arrive in orbit around the Red Planet in February. Called Tianwen-1, or "Questions to Heaven", the rover won't actually try to land on the surface for a further two to three months. This wait-and-see strategy was used successfully by the American Viking landers in the 1970s. It will allow engineers to assess the atmospheric conditions on Mars before attempting what will be a hazardous descent. Tianwen-1 is one of three missions setting off to Mars in the space of 11 days."</em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-53504797">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Work has begun on an ambitious new mission that will carry a cutting-edge 8.4-foot (2.5-meter) telescope high into the stratosphere on a balloon. Tentatively planned to launch in December 2023 from Antarctica, ASTHROS (short for Astrophysics Stratospheric Telescope for High Spectral Resolution Observations at Submillimeter-wavelengths) will spend about three weeks drifting on air currents above the icy southern continent and achieve several firsts along the way. Managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, ASTHROS observes far-infrared light, or light with wavelengths much longer than what is visible to the human eye. To do that, ASTHROS will need to reach an altitude of about 130,000 feet (24.6 miles, or 40 kilometers) - roughly four times higher than commercial airliners fly. Though still well below the boundary of space (about 62 miles, or 100 kilometers, above Earth's surface), it will be high enough to observe light wavelengths blocked by Earth's atmosphere. The mission team recently put the finishing touches on the design for the observatory's payload, which includes its telescope (which captures the light), its science instrument, and such subsystems as the cooling and electronic systems."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7712">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Over the past few years, researchers have been trying to apply quantum physics theory to a variety of fields, including robotics, biology and cognitive science. Computational techniques that draw inspiration from quantum systems, also known as quantum-like (QL) models, could potentially achieve better performance and more sophisticated capabilities than more conventional approaches. Researchers at University of Genoa, in Italy, have recently investigated the feasibility of using a QL approach to enhance a robot's sensing capabilities. In their paper, pre-published on arXiv, they present the results of a case study where they tested a QL perception model on a robot with limited sensing capabilities within a simulated environment. "The idea for this study came to me after reading an article written in 1993 by Anton Amann, ('The Gestalt problem in quantum theory') in which he compared the problem of Gestalt perception with the attribution of molecular shape in quantum physics," Davide Lanza, one of the researchers who carried out the study, told TechXplore. "I was amazed by this parallel between cognition and quantum phenomena, and I discovered then the flourishing field of quantum cognition studies.""</em> <a href="https://techxplore.com/news/2020-07-quantum-like-enable-perception-robots-limited.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Cambridge Engineering alumnus Hal Evans has built a fully-functioning replica of a 1930s Polish cyclometer – an electromechanical cryptologic device that was designed to assist in the decryption of German Enigma ciphertext. The replica currently resides in King’s College, Cambridge. Work on the hardware-based replica began in 2018, as part of Hal’s fourth year Master’s project under the supervision of King's College Fellow and Senior Tutor Dr Tim Flack. The aim was to investigate further into cryptologist Marian Rejewski's cyclometer – an early forerunner to Cambridge University mathematician Alan Turing’s machine, known as the Bombe, which was used to crack the German Enigma code during the Second World War. Hal said he chose to work on the cyclometer as it was the very first machine used to assist the decryption effort. To his knowledge, the replica is the first fully-functioning hardware-based electromechanical cyclometer to exist since the years preceding the Second World War."</em> <a href="http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/news/enigma-code-breaking-machine-rebuilt-cambridge">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Their findings have been published in Energy &amp; Environmental Science on May 20, 2020. A new rechargeable battery that can be charged wirelessly using light from indoor sources, like desk lamps has been developed. This will enable the so-called ‘Energy Recycling,’ which refers to the energy recovery process of utilizing indoor lights that would normally be wasted, by converting it into electricity. A joint research team, led by Professor Hyun-Kon Song (School of Energy and Chemical Engineering) and Professor Tae-Hyuk Kwon (Department of Chemistry) has presented an external-power-free single-structured PRB, named a dye-sensitized photo-rechargeable battery (DSPB) with an outstanding light-to-charge energy efficiency (ηoverall) of 11.5% under the dim light condition. Researchers have also succeeded in demonstrating the ability of the DSPB to operate a temperature-sensing IoT device only by indoor lights, and thus opening the possibility of realizing indoor-light-harvesting PRBs. “Lighting accounts for about 10% of total commercial sector electricity consumption, and thus we expect that the energy recycling effect of that will be enormous,” says Professor Song."</em> <a href="https://news.unist.ac.kr/new-study-presents-indoor-light-energy-harvesting-dye-sensitized-photo-rechargeable-battery/">[...]</a>

Topological physics took off in 2008 with the discovery of topological insulator, a type of material that is electrically insulating in the bulk but metallic on the surface. Since then, scientists have found more exotic topological phases including Dirac semimetals, Weyl semimetals and Axionic insulators. But most recently, materials that are insulating in the bulk, on surfaces and edges but are metallic only on the hinges or at the corners have been theoretically predicted. These bizarre new materials called higher-order topological insulators are extremely rare and only the element bismuth has been experimentally proven to possibly belong to this category so far.

<p><em>"New method for producing thermoset plastics allows them to be broken down more easily after use. Thermosets, which include epoxies, polyurethanes, and rubber used for tires, are found in many products that have to be durable and heat-resistant, such as cars or electrical appliances. One drawback to these materials is that they typically cannot be easily recycled or broken down after use, because the chemical bonds holding them together are stronger than those found in other materials such as thermoplastics. MIT chemists have now developed a way to modify thermoset plastics with a chemical linker that makes the materials much easier to break down, but still allows them to retain the mechanical strength that makes them so useful. In a study appearing today in Nature, the researchers showed that they could produce a degradable version of a thermoset plastic called pDCPD, break it down into a powder, and use the powder to create more pDCPD. They also proposed a theoretical model suggesting that their approach could be applicable to a wide range of plastics and other polymers, such as rubber."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/tough-thermoset-plastics-recyclable-0722">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Character LCDs have been around for a long time. These displays contain a number of discinct blocks—each capable of displaying a single character—so displaying scrolling text would traditionally involve just shifting characters left one block at a time. That’s fine and all, but why not try and raise the bar.. 😏 Hardware Most character displays utilise the Hitachi HD44780 controller chip, which has the neat feature of letting us define and use up to eight custom characters, each 5x8 pixels in size. Mine uses this chip, so I’ll be taking advantage of repeatedly rendering custom characters to pull off smooth scrolling text. I connected an Arduino Leonardo to my salvaged display over its 4-bit interface, and got to work on the software side. Software As we use an Arduino, the software written is in C++."</em> <a href="https://joeraut.com/posts/smooth-scrolling-text-on-character-lcds/">[...]</a>

All of the original controls have been re-used, and you'd never know it's a conversion - until you turn it on! The centre of the tuning dial has been replaced with a bright LCD display showing the icon for the current radio station, with a convex glass bubble lens adding to the vintage aesthetic. The trio of clicky little buttons on top control the power and let you skip up or down through a set of eight station presets. The dials peeping out at each corner are actually large, tactile micro-switch buttons for precisely controlling the volume. On the inside is a Raspberry Pi, with a Pirate Audio board handling the display and amplification, and a 10,000 mAh power bank supplying plenty of juice for long summer afternoons in the garden."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/1964-Dansette-Pi-Internet-Radio/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"I always wanted to have a professional welding table. But the commercial ones cost couple of thousand dollars which is way too much for hobby use. So I have designed my own version which is very similar to the commercial ones, but it costs a fraction of a price. The things that are really cool on this table: - it has pretty much perfectly flat surface - you can clamp your workpieces anywhere in the middle of the table and even on the sides of it. This increases the practicality a million times. - it is on wheels I decided to design a relatively compact table that would be still big enough for most of my projects."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Professional-Grade-Welding-Table-with-FREE-Pla/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This article shows you how to make an infra red analogue transmitter. This is an old circuit. Nowadays laser diodes are used to transmit digital signals via optic fibres. This circuit can be used to to transmit audio signal via infrared. You will need a receiver to detect the transmitted signal. The signal does not need to be modulated."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Infrared-Transmitter/">[...]</a>
