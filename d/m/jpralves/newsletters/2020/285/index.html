<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1608, o matemático e físico italiano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelista_Torricelli">Evangelista Torricelli</a>. Ele inventou o barómetro e cujo trabalho em geometria auxiliou no eventual desenvolvimento do cálculo integral. Inspirado pelos escritos de Galileu, ele escreveu um tratado sobre mecânica, De Motu ("Movimento Concernente"), que impressionou Galileu. Ele também desenvolveu técnicas para a produção de lentes telescópicas. A experiência do barómetro usando "mercúrio" para encher um tubo e depois invertido num prato de mercúrio, realizado na primavera de 1644, tornou o nome de Torricelli famoso. O mérito do cientista italiano foi, antes de tudo, admitir que a causa efectiva da resistência apresentada pela natureza à criação do vácuo (no tubo invertido acima do mercúrio) se devia provavelmente ao peso do ar.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1829, o astrónomo norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asaph_Hall">Asaph Hall</a>. Ele foi responsável pela descoberta e baptismo das duas luas de Marte, Fobos e Deimos, e calculou suas órbitas. Nascido em Goshen, Connecticut, e aprendiz de carpinteiro aos 16 anos, ele tinha paixão por geometria e álgebra. Hall obteve uma posição no Observatório de Harvard em Cambridge, Massachusetts, em 1857 e tornou-se um calculador especialista em órbitas. Em Agosto de 1862, ele juntou-se à equipa do Observatório Naval em Washington, DC, onde fez as suas descobertas, em meados de Agosto de 1877, usando o telescópio refractor "Grande Equatorial" de 26 polegadas do Observatório, então o maior do seu tipo no mundo.</p>

<p>Em 1582, este foi o primeiro dia do calendário gregoriano, por decreto do Papa Gregório XIII, nos países católicos da Itália, Espanha, Portugal e Polónia, que realinharam o calendário com os equinócios. O resto do mundo ainda estava a usar o calendário juliano e reconheceu o dia como 5 de Outubro de 1582.</p>

<p>Em 1939, foi escrito num memorando que seria possível construir um computador com tubos de vácuo que processaria “10.000 operações por segundo”. A previsão de Helmut Schreyer veio na época em que os computadores estavam a ser construídos com relés para funcionar eletromecanicamente. Ele ajudou Konrad Zuse na construção da calculadora automática Z2 concluída no mesmo ano. A Z2 contava com 800 relés nas unidades aritmética e de controle, além de memória mecânica.</p>

<p>Em 1997, a nave espacial Cassini (carregando a sonda Huygens) foi lançada do Cabo Canaveral. O objectivo da missão era orbitar Saturno, recolhendo dados sobre o próprio planeta gigante, a sua magnetosfera, anéis e luas. Após uma viagem de quatro anos, em 30 de Junho de 2004, a Cassini entrou em órbita a volta de Saturno. No caminho, sobrevoou Vénus, a Terra e Júpiter. Pouco depois da chegada, lançou a sonda Huygens, que pousou na lua Titã. Após duas extensões produtivas, a missão da Cassini foi encerrada em 15 de Setembro de 2017, com um mergulho planeado para queimar na atmosfera de Saturno.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou o Linux Kernel 5.9 foi declarado estável, com Linus Torvalds observando "não parece haver nada particularmente assustador aqui", apesar do número de ajustes na semana anterior. Esta versão implementa melhor gestão de memória anónima (malloc'ed); um novo controlador cgroup slab que melhora a utilização do slab, permitindo que os cgroups de memória compartilhem a memória slab; suporte para desfragmentação pró-activa da memória; capacidade de observação da CPU para a classe de agendamento de prazos; suporte para executar programas BPF em pesquisas de sockets; nova chamada de sistema close_range() para fechar intervalos de descritores de ficheiros, suporte para instruções FSGSBASE x86 que fornecem comutação de contexto mais rápida, suporte NFS para atributos estendidos; e suporte no kernel da compressão ZSTD para ramdisk e initramfs. Como sempre, existem muitos outros novos drivers e melhorias, entre os quais há suporte inicial para placas de vídeo AMD Radeon RX 6000 e GPUs Intel Rocket Lake.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou foi anunciada a nova placa BBC micro:bit. A nova BBC micro:bit é um dispositivo mais poderoso que combina todos os mesmos recursos da placa original e adiciona microfone embutido, alto-falante, sensor de toque capacitivo e botão de economia de energia. Os desenvolvimentos mais recentes também fornecem uma plataforma técnica actualizada projectada para fornecer recursos para a introdução de projectos futuros que permitirão futuros projectos de educação de IA e ML nas escolas. O Processador foi substituído pelo Nordic nRF52833, tendo como consequência a sua Flash foi duplicada para 512KB e a memória RAM passou para 128KB, sendo o suporte de Bluetooth passado para 5.0. Foi igualmente aumentada a corrente disponível para dispositivos para 200mA, entre outras melhorias já referidas.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou a missão Soyuz MS-17 foi lançada no dia 14 a partir do cosmodromo de Baikonur, no Cazaquistão. Os três astronautas, uma norte-americana e dois russos percorreram os cerca de 400 km em apenas 3 horas e 3 minutos. A Acoplagem decorreu a cerca 400 km de altitude por cima do Brasil. Esta missão de duas órbitas foi modelada há algum tempo, tendo sido testada com veículos de carga.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos assim como projetos de maker. É apresentada a revista newelectronics de 13 Outubro.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/10/12/linux_5_9/">Eight release candidates later and it's out: New hardware and more AMD in Linux 5.9</a></h2>

<p><em>"Linux 5.9 has been declared stable, with Linus Torvalds observing "there doesn't really seem to be anything particularly scary in here" despite the number of tweaks in the last week. Although more lines had been changed than he would have preferred, the chief maintainer saw little reason for delay so version 5.9 is upon us. The bulk of the changes this time around lurked in "networking stuff", according to Torvalds, and there have been eight release candidates needed to get to this point. As for version 5.9 itself, there is initial support for AMD's Radeon RX 6000 graphics cards and Intel Rocket Lake GPUs. On the eve of release, the team at Phoronix noted that the AMDGPU graphics driver accounted for more than 10 per cent of the lines of code lurking within the source tree for the 5.9 kernel (although a huge chunk of that was actually auto-generated header files). For 5.9, the deadline scheduling class is now aware of the capacity of each CPU and FSGSBASE x86 instructions see support, bringing with it the potential for a jump in performance."</em> <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/10/12/linux_5_9/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Discover the simplicity of teaching with sound and touch with the new BBC micro:bit. Announced today and available from November 2020 the latest micro:bit comes with built-in speaker, microphone and capacitive touch sensor. The original BBC micro:bit was created at the BBC in partnership with world-class technology and product design co-creators. In 2016 the BBC "Make it Digital" campaign gave away one million micro:bits for free to students across the UK as computing was added to the school curriculum. BBC Director General Tim Davie said: “From the very beginning the BBC’s purpose has been to inform, educate and entertain – qualities which are all reflected in the micro:bit project. Since its launch through our Make it Digital campaign, it has helped transform digital skills and learning."</em> <a href="https://microbit.org/news/2020-10-13/meet-the-new-bbc-microbit/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.space.com/soyuz-rocket-launches-us-russian-astronauts-expedition-63-64">Soyuz crew launches on 'ultrafast' two-orbit flight to space station</a></h2>

<p><em>"An American astronaut and two Russian cosmonauts have launched to the International Space Station just ahead of and to extend 20 years of a continuous human presence in Earth orbit. Kate Rubins of NASA, together with Sergey Ryzhikov and Sergey Kud-Sverchkov of Roscosmos, lifted off on Russia's Soyuz MS-17 spacecraft from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on Wednesday (Oct. 14). Their launch, atop a Soyuz-2.1a rocket, began at 1:45 a.m. EDT (0545 GMT; 10:45 a.m. local Kazakh time). The three crewmates are docked their Soyuz at the station's Rassvet module at 4:48 a.m. EDT (0848 GMT) after a two-orbit rendezvous, wrapping up a three-hour, three-minute trip. This mission marks the first crewed use of an "ultrafast" flight plan, which will see the Soyuz arrive at the space station within three hours of its launch, rather than following an earlier expedited six-hour track or two-day path. "This two-orbit rendezvous has been modeled for quite a while now."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/soyuz-rocket-launches-us-russian-astronauts-expedition-63-64">[...]</a>

Down below is a potential trove of science targets. With a typical rover, the operators would need to find another target, but this is DuAxel, a robot built for situations exactly like this. The rover is actually made of a pair of two-wheeled rovers, each called Axel. To divide and conquer, the rover stops, lowers its chassis and anchors it to the ground before essentially splitting in two.

<p><em>"MIT engineers have made their initial design more practical, efficient, and scalable. Researchers at MIT and elsewhere have significantly boosted the output from a system that can extract drinkable water directly from the air even in dry regions, using heat from the sun or another source. The system, which builds on a design initially developed three years ago at MIT by members of the same team, brings the process closer to something that could become a practical water source for remote regions with limited access to water and electricity. The findings are described today in the journal Joule, in a paper by Professor Evelyn Wang, who is head of MIT’s Department of Mechanical Engineering; graduate student Alina LaPotin; and six others at MIT and in Korea and Utah. The earlier device demonstrated by Wang and her co-workers provided a proof of concept for the system, which harnesses a temperature difference within the device to allow an adsorbent material — which collects liquid on its surface — to draw in moisture from the air at night and release it the next day. When the material is heated by sunlight, the difference in temperature between the heated top and the shaded underside makes the water release back out of the adsorbent material."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/solar-extracts-drinkable-water-1014">[...]</a>

Featured as the cover article in the journal Nature, the work was conducted by the lab of Ranga Dias, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering and of physics and astronomy. Dias says developing materials that are superconducting—without electrical resistance and expulsion of magnetic field at room temperature—is the “holy grail” of condensed matter physics. Sought for more than a century, such materials “can definitely change the world as we know it,” Dias says. In setting the new record, Dias and his research team combined hydrogen with carbon and sulfur to photochemically synthesize simple organic-derived carbonaceous sulfur hydride in a diamond anvil cell, a research device used to examine miniscule amounts of materials under extraordinarily high pressure. The carbonaceous sulfur hydride exhibited superconductivity at about 58 degrees Fahrenheit and a pressure of about 39 million pounds per square inch (psi)."</em> <a href="https://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/rochester-sets-new-record-for-room-temperature-superconductor-455722/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/news/3378/">Tetrahedra May Explain Water ‘s Uniqueness</a></h2>

<p><em>"Researchers at the Institute of Industrial Science at The University of Tokyo sifted through experimental data to probe the possibility that supercooled water has a liquid-to-liquid phase transition between disordered and tetrahedrally structured forms. They found evidence of a critical point based on the cooperative formation of tetrahedra, and show its minor role in water's anomalies. This work shows that water's special qualities--which are essential for life--originate predominantly from the two-state feature. Liquid water is indispensable for life as we know it, yet many of its properties do not conform with the way other fluids behave. Some of these anomalies, such as water's maximum density at 4°C and its large heat capacity, have important implications for living organisms. The origin of these features has sparked fierce debates in the scientific community since the time of Röntgen."</em> <a href="https://www.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/news/3378/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Moore’s law is an empirical suggestion describing that the number of transistors doubles every few years in integrated circuits (ICs). However, Moore’s law has started to fail as transistors are now so small that the current silicon-based technologies are unable to offer further opportunities for shrinking. One possibility of overcoming Moore’s law is to resort to two-dimensional semiconductors. These two-dimensional materials are so thin that they can allow the propagation of free charge carriers, namely electrons and holes in transistors that carry the information, along an ultra-thin plane. This confinement of charge carriers can potentially allow the switching of the semiconductor very easily. It also allows directional pathways for the charge carriers to move without scattering and therefore leading to infinitely small resistance for the transistors."</em> <a href="http://www.fleet.org.au/blog/liquid-metals-come-to-the-rescue-of-semiconductors/">[...]</a>

This work, which verifies one of the predictions of Einstein’s General Relativity, is to be published in the journal Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics. The General Theory of Relativity, published by Albert Einstein between 1911 and 1916, introduced a new concept of space and time, by showing that massive objects cause a distortion in space-time which is felt as gravity. In this way, Einstein’s theory predicts, for example, that light travels in curved paths near massive objects, and one consequence is the observation of the Einstein Cross, four different images of a distant galaxy which lies behind a nearer massive object, and whose light is distorted by it. Other well known effects of General Relativity are the observed gradual change in Mercury’s orbit due to space-time curvature around the “massive” Sun, or the gravitational redshift, the displacement to the red of lines in the spectrum of the Sun due to its gravitational field. The gravitational redshift is an important effect for satellite navigation systems such as GPS, which would not work if General Relativity was not put into the equations."</em> <a href="http://www.iac.es/en/outreach/news/new-measurements-solar-spectrum-verify-einsteins-theory-general-relativity">[...]</a>

When researching how Braille worked and the tools that were used to generate said writing, I was surprised to see how expensive they were. It was as if there were two price ranges: Very expensive and very precise (we are talking upwards of $2000) Very cheap and not very precise For Braille to be read quickly and easily, there are a series of dimensions one must follow (such as the distance between bumps, from the edge of the paper etc.). As such, I thought that a tool that would be very useful would be one that was cheap and even Open Source, whilst also capable of stimulating the interaction between the blind and those who aren't. With that in mind, our team developed B.E.E (which stands for Braille Embossing Experience).

<p><em>"I made my NeoPixel Party Bike for two reasons: First, I've worked on a few simple NeoPixel projects in the past and it was like a "tease" that made me want to know more-more-more! Second, I'm a member of BikeJC, a bicycle club in Jersey City that goes on rides at night throughout the summer. Most members light up their bikes with off-the-shelf bike lights - but I've been wanting to apply my hacker skills to my bike -- and make it epic! I designed this project as my own personal "school" - my goal is to learn more about NeoPixels, music visualizations, and BLE. I already learned a lot and I'm happy to share it with you! I put in the time to make the physical hardware durable so that I can continue to deepen my knowledge of code, run tests, and try new skills on the same equipment - I think of it now as my "canvas for learning and testing"!"</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/NeoPixel-Party-Bike-Music-Reactive-Animations-With/">[...]</a>

Cause I've been working at home and being cooped up in my room, I decided to make a CO2 meter as a guide to ventilate my room. A MOX gas type that called CCS811 showed inappropriate results for measuring actual CO2 concentration, such as higher readings due to human farting, so I use a high-precision NDIR-type MH-Z19B in this case. I designed all of these to fit inside the enclosure for safe use.

<p><em>"WS2812 LEDs (‘NeoPixels’) are intelligent devices, that can be programmed to a specific 24-bit red, green &amp; blue (RGB) colour, by a pulse train on a single wire. They are capable of being daisy-chained, so a single pulse line can drive a large number of devices. The programming pulses have to be accurately timed to within fractions of a microsecond, so conventional Raspberry Pi techniques are of limited use; they can only handle a small number of pulse channels, driving a maximum of 1 or 2 strings of LEDs, which is insufficient for a complex display. This blog post describes a new technique that uses the RPi Secondary Memory Interface (SMI) to drive 8 or 16 channels with very accurate timing. No additional hardware is needed, apart from a 3.3 to 5V level-shifter, that is required for all NeoPixel interfaces.

I have previously worked on some real-time apps using Sockets, so with the same concept, I decided to make some IoT projects with Node.js server for self-learning. This Rover of mine communicates with my Node.js server using Bluetooth and on the front-end, I send commands to the server using Sockets. Project Aim To study and implement wireless communication between Node server and hardware (which is in this case our Rover), and to remotely control the Rover with a mobile web-page served by Node server using Sockets. Prerequisite You need to have some basic knowledge of Node, socket programming, and L298 Motor Driver working."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/adityahazarika08/node-js-wireless-controlled-rover-78cc00">[...]</a>

<p><em>"I've had too many requests about my mini power supply, so i made instructable for it. I’m in a progress of building new 2 channel power supply, but due to ongoing pandemic the shipping is slow and items keep disappearing. Meanwhile i decided to build temporary and easy PS from parts i had already laying around. Main goals where: - Easy to build - Cheap parts and modules - Easy to upgrade and modify - Look nice on the workbench"</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Mini-Bench-Power-Supply-Vintage-Style/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Two stepper motors and an Arduino to turn around an SMD part. For my manual pick and place machine, it would be handy to have a tool that flips SMD parts that are upside down in the storage box. The supplier has such a tool but it is not that cheap, so could I make such a tool myself? Yes... First, my son has designed the needed parts with Solid Works and prepared them for 3D printing. After that, I wrote a test program for driving the stepper motors. I'm using a Arduino Nano Every because of his price and the dimensions."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/VGEST/smd-flipper-4161fc">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Hello everyone! In this Instructables project I will show you how to make your own Arcade Box! I designed it to fit a 15" and 17" 4:3 Monitor and kept its dimensions small so that it does not take up much space. The "heart" of this game machine is the Raspberry Pi running the RetroPie, a front end management application for launching your games! Tutorial updates can also be found here: https://www.ardumotive.com/arcadegameboxen.html Here you can see a video from our Arcade Box! The video is in Greek language but I believe that you will catch the main idea..."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Arcade-Box-With-Raspberry-Pi-and-RetroPie/">[...]</a>
