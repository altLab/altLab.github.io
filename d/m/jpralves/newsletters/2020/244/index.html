<p>Esta é a primeira newsletter de 2020 e faz hoje 100 anos que nascia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a>, este autor de ficção cientifica é extraordinariamente conhecido pela sua obra extensa de mais de 500 livros. Juntamente com Arthur C. Clack e Robert A. Heinlein é considerado um dos três maiores escritores de ficção cientifica de todos os tempos. Ficou igualmente conhecido por ter enunciado as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics">três leis da robótica</a> que governam a ética dos robôs face aos humanos. As regras foram introduzidas numa pequena história designada por "Runaround", em 1942, sendo posteriormente incluídas na colecção "I, Robot".
Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Hatchett">Charles Hatchett</a>. Ele foi responsável pela descoberta do elemento químico nióbio.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Clausius">Rudolf Clausius</a>, um dos fundadores da termodinâmica também faz anos que nasceu, em 1822, publicou em 1850 os conceitos básicos da segunda lei da termodinâmica - "A quantidade de entropia de qualquer sistema isolado termo-dinamicamente tende a incrementar-se com o tempo, até alcançar um valor máximo".
Não menos importante é <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Keck">Donald B. Keck</a>, que faz anos hoje que nasceu, em 1941 e é responsável pela invenção da guia de onda óptica de sílica fundida mais conhecida por fibra óptica. Maurer, Keck, e Schultz resolveram o problema que anteriormente impedia a utilização desta tecnologia. Actualmente um cabo de fibra óptica consegue transportar a maior distância cerca de 65.000 vezes mais informação que um cabo de cobre.</p>

<p>Na newsletter desta semana ficámos a saber que o matemático e cientista da computação Donald Knuth, conhecido pela sua colecção de livros "The Art of Computer Programming" (TAOCP), considerada por muitos a bíblia da ciência da computação, usou um número muito particular ao longo dos seus livros. Ele usou o numero pi de forma explicita e também de forma relativamente despercebida ao longo dos seus livros divertindo-se com isso. Na sua apresentação anual ele falou de forma apaixonada do número pi e das suas curiosidades.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou e mesmo no final do ano a segunda plataforma WindFloat Atlantic das três que compõem o projecto saiu no passado domingo do porto de Ferrol para uma localização a cerca de 20 km da costa portuguesa, perto de Viana do Castelo. O transporte das três estruturas flutuantes do WindFloat Atlantic é um marco em si, pois evita a necessidade de rebocar embarcações projectadas especificamente para esse processo e possibilita a replicação do projecto em outras geografias. Uma vez operacional e com capacidade instalada de 25 MW, o parque eólico poderá gerar energia suficiente para abastecer o equivalente a 60.000 utilizadores por ano.</p>

<p>Na newsletter desta semana são apresentados diversos projectos de maker assim como diversas noticias de novidades que ocorreram nesta semana que passou.</p>

<p>Asimov disse "A frase mais emocionante de se ouvir na ciência, a que anuncia novas descobertas, não é 'Eureka!' mas 'Isto é engraçado ...'"</p>

<p>Um excelente ano para todos!</p>

<p><em>"For a quarter of a century, Stanford’s great computer science professor emeritus has been delivering a special “Christmas Tree” lecture each December. Now approaching his 82nd birthday, Donald Knuth emerged again on Dec. 5 for the 25th annual installment — and took the time to remind his audience that he’s also still diligently writing the book he’s been working on for the last 57 years. That book is The Art of Computer Programming, revered among programmers as one of the most comprehensive analyses of algorithms available. The book is “widely considered to be among the best scientific writings of the century,” according to one web page at Stanford. “My full-time writing schedule means that I have to be pretty much a hermit,” writes Knuth on his personal site. So it’s a doubly special occasion when the great man makes a live appearance."</em> <a href="https://thenewstack.io/donald-knuths-2019-christmas-tree-lecture-explores-pi-in-the-art-of-computer-programming/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This operation builds on the successful installation of the first platform in October and will follow the same route from the Galician port to its final destination 20 km off the Portuguese coast. Windplus is a consortium made up of EDP RENEWABLES, ENGIE, REPSOL and PRINCIPLE POWER. WindFloat Atlantic has taken another important step towards entry into operations. The second of the three platforms, which make up the project, has left the Port of Ferrol for its final destination 20 km off the coast of Portugal at Viana do Castelo.. Upon arrival to the project site, it will be installed next to the first floating platform, which has the exact same dimensions: 30 metres in height and with a 50-m distance between each column. The third and final platform, once it arrives to the site, will complete the first floating offshore wind farm in Continental Europe."</em> <a href="https://www.edpr.com/en/news/2019/12/30/second-platform-windfloatatlantic-has-set-from-port-ferrol">[...]</a>

<p><em>"NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory has observed a magnetic explosion the likes of which have never been seen before. In the scorching upper reaches of the Sun’s atmosphere, a prominence — a large loop of material launched by an eruption on the solar surface — started falling back to the surface of the Sun. But before it could make it, the prominence ran into a snarl of magnetic field lines, sparking a magnetic explosion. Scientists have previously seen the explosive snap and realignment of tangled magnetic field lines on the Sun — a process known as magnetic reconnection — but never one that had been triggered by a nearby eruption. The observation, which confirms a decade-old theory, may help scientists understand a key mystery about the Sun’s atmosphere, better predict space weather, and may also lead to breakthroughs in the controlled fusion and lab plasma experiments. “This was the first observation of an external driver of magnetic reconnection,” said Abhishek Srivastava, solar scientist at Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), in Varanasi, India."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/nasa-s-sdo-sees-new-kind-of-magnetic-explosion-on-sun">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.bris.ac.uk/news/2019/december/quantum-teleportation.html">First chip-to-chip quantum teleportation harnessing silicon photonic chip fabrication</a></h2>

<p><em>"The development of technologies which can process information based on the laws of quantum physics are predicted to have profound impacts on modern society. For example, quantum computers may hold the key to solving problems that are too complex for today’s most powerful supercomputers, and a quantum internet could ultimately protect the worlds information from malicious attacks. However, these technologies all rely on ‘quantum information’, which is typically encoded in single quantum particles that are extremely difficult to control and measure. Scientists from the University of Bristol, in collaboration with the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), have successfully developed chip-scale devices that are able to harness the applications of quantum physics by generating and manipulating single particles of light within programmable nano-scale circuits. These chips are able to encode quantum information in light generated inside the circuits and can process the ‘quantum information’ with high efficiency and extremely low noise. This demonstration could enable a significant boost in the ability to produce more complex quantum circuits that are required in quantum computing and communications."</em> <a href="http://www.bris.ac.uk/news/2019/december/quantum-teleportation.html">[...]</a>

With quantum computers on the rise, we can no longer exclude the possibility that a quantum computer will become so powerful it can break existing cryptography. Single particles of light are already being used to protect data but the transmission of 1 bit per photon is slow. Pepijn Pinkse led the experiment to increase the transmission speed up to 7 bits per photon.

<p><em>"Thanks to the implementation of advanced random access schemes using efficient, low complexity algorithms. According to a study published in International Journal of Satellite Communications and Networking of which one of its authors is Giuseppe Cocco, a researcher at the DTIC and at the German Aerospace Center (DLR). ince some years ago, the Internet of Things (IoT) has been a constantly evolving reality. The possibility that machines (nodes) can communicate with each other has paved the way for applications that promise to have a profound impact on our lives. They include smart farming, home automation and communication between vehicles. One of the key elements of the IoT is wireless communication between machines, known as Machine-to-Machine (M2M) Communication."</em> <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/e-noticies/home/-/asset_publisher/wEpPxsVRD6Vt/content/id/230986285/maximized">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/news/2019/045917.html">Paving the way for spintronic RAMs: A deeper look into a powerful spin phenomenon</a></h2>

<p><em>"Scientists at Tokyo Institute of Technology explore a new material combination that sets the stage for magnetic random access memories, which rely on spin—an intrinsic property of electrons— and could outperform current storage devices. Their breakthrough published in a new study describes a novel strategy to exploit spin-related phenomena in topological materials, which could spur several advances in the field of spin electronics. Moreover, this study provides additional insight into the underlying mechanism of spin-related phenomena. Spintronics is a modern technological field where the "spin" or the angular momentum of electrons takes a primary role in the functioning of electronic devices. In fact, collective spin arrangements are the reason for the curious properties of magnetic materials, which are popularly used in modern electronics. Researchers globally have been trying to manipulate spin-related properties in certain materials, owing to a myriad of applications in devices that work on this phenomenon, especially in non-volatile memories."</em> <a href="https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/news/2019/045917.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Imagine a world where people could only talk to their next-door neighbor, and messages must be passed house to house to reach far destinations. Until now, this has been the situation for the bits of hardware that make up a silicon quantum computer, a type of quantum computer with the potential to be cheaper and more versatile than today’s versions. Now a team based at Princeton University has overcome this limitation and demonstrated that two quantum-computing components, known as silicon “spin” qubits, can interact even when spaced relatively far apart on a computer chip. The study was published in the journal Nature. “The ability to transmit messages across this distance on a silicon chip unlocks new capabilities for our quantum hardware,” said Jason Petta, the Eugene Higgins Professor of Physics at Princeton and leader of the study. “The eventual goal is to have multiple quantum bits arranged in a two-dimensional grid that can perform even more complex calculations."</em> <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/news/2019/12/30/leap-quantum-computing-silicon-quantum-bits-establish-long-distance-relationship">[...]</a>

The design can control 16 servos simultaneously, using the Adafruit PCA9685 servo driver board. In order to save space, it only has 4 potentiometers for adjustment and a seperate set of switches are used to select the set of four you'd like to control. One problem I encountered in early prototypes was that the design was pretty hard to solder and then cram into a little box, so this most recent design is printed flat, soldered and folded up, making it super easy to assemble!

<h2><a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Lets-Make-the-BackpAQ-Personal-Air-Quality-Monitor/">Let's Make the BackpAQ Personal Air Quality Monitor</a></h2>

<p><em>"The BackpAQ Project The BackpAQ project is part of a middle and high school STEM curriculum that promotes learning about and experience with the monitoring of air quality (AQ) particularly in disadvantaged communities, and drives engagement among underrepresented youth in STEM activities. Key to the program is deployment of a suite of community-based mobile air quality monitors that leverage new low-cost sensors. These handheld units can be readily assembled by advanced middle-school and high school students and other STEM-oriented youth who are motivated by interest in obtaining, understanding and sharing hyper-local air quality data. What we'll build These student-built monitors, encased in a lightweight polycarbonate box, weigh less than a pound and are powered by rechargeable LiPo batteries. They feature carabineers and nylon straps for easy fastening to a backpack or bicycle frame. What well measure As designed, the monitors will measure and display criteria pollutants PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 concentrations in ug/m3, as well as display the US EPA Air Quality Index (AQI)."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Lets-Make-the-BackpAQ-Personal-Air-Quality-Monitor/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"That's a kind of project that took a long time to be finished, despite its simplicity! That's because I have used, for a long time, a UV fluorescent lamp box to do my printed circuit boards and I always thought that another one, using UV LED's, could wait once more time to be assembled!... Until now!The main design consists of a wood-covered MDF box, a UV LED matrix board and a PIC microcontroller to control exposure time. All the projecs is described and available below. Supplies: * Laser-cut MDF parts; * light imbuia sheet; * UV LED array; * PIC microcontroller timer circuit. "</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/PCB-UV-LED-Array-Timer/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Covert-ATX-Power-Supply-to-Bench-Power-Supply/">Covert ATX Power Supply to Bench Power Supply</a></h2>

<p><em>"A bench power supply is necessary when working with electronics, but a commercially available lab power supply can be very expensive for any beginner who wants to explore and learn electronics. But there is a cheap and reliable alternative. By converting a computer ATX power supply that can be found in any discarded computer or can be bought from scrapyard for less than a dollar, you can get a good lab power supply with huge current outputs, short circuit protection and very tight voltage regulation. In this instructable I will show you how to quickly convert any ATX power supply to get a lab power supply with following specifications. An ON/OFF switch Indicator LEDs Output voltages : 12VDC, 5VDC, 3.3VDC Two USB ports with 5VDC output @2A WARNING: YOU ARE WORKING WITH AC VOLTAGE!!! IF YOU ARE NOT SURE OF WHAT YOU ARE DOING - DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Covert-ATX-Power-Supply-to-Bench-Power-Supply/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/nategri/chernobyl_dice/tree/master">Chernobyl Dice</a></h2>

<p><em>"The Chernobyl Dice is a quantum random number generator [0] that uses nuclear decays from a weakly radioactive sample as a source of entropy. It consists of four primary components: - An Arduino Nano microcontroller - A Geiger counter - Six uranium glass marbles - Nixie tube display - Geiger counter events ("clicks") are converted into random bits using the following algorithm: In a ring buffer, for each millisecond record either a 0 or a 1, depending on whether or not a Geiger event occurred - Perform an initial de-bias of this 0-dominated stream using von Neumann's method [0] - Further de-bias by XOR-ing bits generated in the previous step with the mod2 of elapsed 4 microsecond intervals since since the device was powered on - The uranium glass sample is illuminated by an array of ultraviolet LEDs at each Geiger event, which makes them fluoresce bright green. This has nothing to do with the radioactivity of the sample, but it does, however, look really cool. Operation The device has three modes of operations, which can be selected via the rotary switch: Clock Mode Displays the current time, with the Geiger board unpowered. The time can be set by flipping the toggle switches on and off (the '16' toggle increments the hour, the '8' toggle increments 10 minutes, the '4' toggle increments 1 minute, and the '1' toggle resets the seconds). Streaming Mode Repeatedly generates random numbers of a size specified by the toggles (or random bytes from 0-255 if no toggles are set)."</em> <a href="https://github.com/nategri/chernobyl_dice/tree/master">[...]</a>
