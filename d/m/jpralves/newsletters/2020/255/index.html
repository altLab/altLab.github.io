<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1883, o químico inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Haworth">Norman Haworth</a>. Ele partilhou (com o químico suíço Paul Karrer) o Prémio Nobel de Química de 1937 pelo seu trabalho na determinação das estruturas químicas de vários carbo-hidratos e na síntese de vitamina C (1934), que foi a primeira preparação artificial de qualquer vitamina.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1900, o físico francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Joliot-Curie">Frédéric Joliot-Curie</a>. Ele tornou-se assistente pessoal de Marie Curie no Radium Institute, Paris, e no ano seguinte casou-se com sua filha Irène (que também era assistente do instituto). Mais tarde, eles colaboraram na pesquisa e partilharam o Prémio Nobel de Química de 1935 "em reconhecimento à síntese de novos elementos radioactivos". Por exemplo, eles descobriram que átomos de alumínio expostos a raios alfa se transmutavam em átomos de fósforo radioactivo.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1943, o químico mexico-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_J._Molina">Mario Molina</a>. Ele partilhou o Prémio Nobel da Química de 1995, juntamente com os químicos F. Sherwood Rowland e Paul Crutzen, por pesquisas na década de 1970 sobre a decomposição da camada de ozono, que protege a Terra de perigosas radiações solares. As descobertas de Molina e Rowland, de que alguns gases fabricados industrialmente destroem a camada de ozono, levaram a um movimento internacional no final do século 20 para limitar o uso generalizado de gases clorofluorocarbonetos (CFC).</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou continuamos a acompanhar a evolução da pandemia do COVID-19. E de entre as história da semana aparece uma de uma empresa de impressoras 3D na Itália que projectou e imprimiu 100 válvulas de respiração que salvam vidas em 24 horas para um hospital que ficou sem elas. A válvula conecta pacientes em terapia intensiva a aparelhos respiratórios. O hospital, em Brescia, tinha 250 pacientes com coronavírus em terapia intensiva e as válvulas foram projectadas para serem usadas por no máximo oito horas por vez.</p>

<p>Também esta semana nos chega outra história relacionada, esta do Prusa - criador da impressora 3D open source. Ele fala das opções que a comunidade de impressão 3D pode criar e que já criou como vimos a história anterior para resolver problemas de produção de dispositivos que se encontram em falta por ruptura de stock. Ele fala igualmente do trabalho que ele e a equipa dele teve junto das autoridades da Republica Checa para criar o "awareness" e a necessidade de ter este tipo de fabrico como opção válida.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como alguns modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis. São apresentados os livros "Essential Raspberry Pi Tips" e "Introduction to Circuits" ambos da element14.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51911070">Coronavirus: 3D printers save hospital with valves</a></h2>

<p><em>"A 3D-printer company in Italy has designed and printed 100 life-saving respirator valves in 24 hours for a hospital that had run out of them. The valve connects patients in intensive care to breathing machines. The hospital, in Brescia, had 250 coronavirus patients in intensive care and the valves are designed to be used for a maximum of eight hours at a time. The 3D-printed version cost less than €1 (90p) each to produce and the prototype took three hours to design. Italian journalist Nunzia Vallini put the hospital in touch with Isinnova chief executive Cristian Fracassi after discovering the original supplier was unable to supply new valves quickly. He and mechanical engineer Alessandro Romaioli raced there to see the valve for themselves - and three hours later, returned with a prototype."</em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51911070">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Hello everyone, times are tough so I will keep this short and to the point. The 3D printing community is amazing! We are all problem solvers and enjoy building things not only for our lives but also for others. In the past few weeks, we have received many messages with respirator designs, medical ventilators and other devices (that are missing in hospital’s warehouses right now) – you are looking for ways to help with this global pandemic and that’s a great thing. The worldwide demand for these devices is so huge, that in some countries, even doctors don’t have access to masks and face shields, so they have to undertake a huge risk and work without protective equipment. I am extremely proud of the whole 3D printing community and want you all to keep going!"</em> <a href="https://blog.prusaprinters.org/from-design-to-mass-3d-printing-of-medical-shields-in-three-days/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Nabil Imam, a senior research scientist in Intel Labs’ neuromorphic computing group, works with olfactory neurophysiologists at Cornell University. “My friends at Cornell study the biological olfactory system in animals and measure the electrical activity in their brains as they smell odors,” explains Imam, who has a doctorate in neuromorphic computing. “On the basis of these circuit diagrams and electrical pulses, we derived a set of algorithms and configured them on neuromorphic silicon, specifically our Loihi test chip.” Loihi is Intel’s neuromorphic computing chip that applies the principles of computation found in biological brains to computer architectures. First, how we smell: If you pick up a grapefruit and take a whiff, that fruit’s molecules stimulate olfactory cells in your nose (the word olfactory originates from Latin’s olfactare, which means “to smell”). The cells in your nose immediately send signals to your brain’s olfactory system where electrical pulses within an interconnected group of neurons generate a smell’s sensation. Whether you’re smelling a grapefruit, a rose or a noxious gas, networks of neurons in your brain create sensations specific to the object."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news/how-computer-chip-smell-without-nose/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4218.html">STMicroelectronics Launches Smart Gateway Platform for Automotive Gateway and Domain Controller Applications</a></h2>

<p><em>"The Smart Gateway Platform (SGP) from STMicroelectronics provides a valuable development tool for prototyping automotive Smart-Gateway and Domain-Controller applications. The evolution of automotive architectures to include high throughput in-vehicle networking and high data-rate connectivity to the cloud has increased demand for high-performance Smart-Gateway and Domain-Controller Electronic Control Units (ECUs). ST’s modular Smart-Gateway Platform (SGP), built on gigabit Ethernet communication between the secure and ASIL-B Telemaco3P microprocessor (MPU) and the ASIL-D SPC58/Chorus microcontroller (MCU), delivers powerful processing capability to handle firewall functionalities, predictive maintenance, Over-The-Air (OTA) upgrades, and high data-rate communication among different ECUs and to the cloud. While the Chorus MCU provides real-time, low-power, and secure in-vehicle connectivity through its multiple CAN-FD interfaces, the Telemaco3P MPU extends gateway computational capabilities by delivering dual Arm® Cortex® A7 processing power with the Posix OS support and embedded Security Module to handle OTA updates, firewall, and predictive-maintenance functions. The SGP reference design features a rich set of in-vehicle network interfaces including multiple Ethernet and CAN ports as well as support for LIN and FlexRay connections. It is deployed with a comprehensive starter package including hardware design files, hardware/software documentation, software utilities (drivers and flashers), and sample applications."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4218.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A few months ago, we revealed Xbox Series X, our fastest, most powerful console ever, designed for a console generation that has you, the player, at its center. When it is released this holiday season, Xbox Series X will set a new bar for performance, speed and compatibility, all while allowing you to bring your gaming legacy forward with you and play thousands of games from four generations. Recently, along with the tech experts Austin Evans and Digital Foundry, we had the chance to take a closer look at some of the technologies that are powering Xbox Series X and talk to the team about the choices they made when defining the next generation of gaming. We spent an entire day discussing everything from the console’s custom processor and latency solutions to backward compatibility and visual enhancements. (Editor’s Note: We’ll be using some acronyms and discussing technologies in this post without always defining them. To that end, we’ve created an Xbox Series X glossary that contains many of these terms and more."</em> <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/03/16/xbox-series-x-tech/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/19/open-source-project-spins-up-3d-printed-ventilator-validation-prototype-in-just-one-week/">Open-source project spins up 3D-printed ventilator validation prototype in just one week</a></h2>

<p><em>"In a great example of what can happen when smart, technically-oriented people come together in a time of need, an open-source hardware project started by a group including Irish entrepreneur Colin Keogh and Breeze Automation CEO and co-founder Gui Calavanti has produced a prototype ventilator using 3D-printed parts and readily available, inexpensive material. The ventilator prototype was designed and produced in just seven days, after the project spun up on Facebook and attracted participation from over 300 engineers, medical professionals and researchers. The prototype will now enter into a validation process by the Irish Health Services Executive (HSE), the country’s health regulatory body. This will technically only validate it for use in Ireland, which ironically looks relatively well-stocked for ventilator hardware, but it will be a key stamp of approval that could pave the way for its deployment across countries where there are shortages, including low-income nations. Ventilator hardware in the U.S. is also likely to encounter shortages, depending on the progress of coronavirus spread in the country. On Wednesday, the White House enacted the Defense Production Act, which provides broad powers to the President for redirecting materials and private company production capacity to building much-needed supplies and equipment in a time of crisis."</em> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/19/open-source-project-spins-up-3d-printed-ventilator-validation-prototype-in-just-one-week/">[...]</a>

While quantum physics is usually concerned with the basic building blocks of light and matter, for some time scientists have now been trying to investigate the quantum properties of larger objects, thereby probing the boundary between the quantum world and everyday life. For this purpose, particles are slowed down with the help of electromagnetic waves and the motional energy is drastically reduced. Therefore, one also speaks of "motional cooling".

When that rubber material bends or moves, electrical signals are created by the highly conductive, nanoscale graphene embedded within its engineered honeycomb structure. “Silicone gives us the flexibility and durability required for biomonitoring applications, and the added, embedded graphene makes it an effective sensor,” said Ehsan Toyserkani, research director at the Multi-Scale Additive Manufacturing (MSAM) Lab at Waterloo. “It’s all together in a single part.” Fabricating a silicone rubber structure with such complex internal features is only possible using state-of-the-art 3D printing – also known as additive manufacturing - equipment and processes.

This research was conducted in collaboration with colleagues from the Micro/Nano Fabrication Laboratory Microsystem and Terahertz Research Center (China), the A. V.

The growing interest in the THz frequency range can be easily explained by its various potential applications.

<p><em>"In a paper published in NANO, a group of researchers from Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea provide a comprehensive review of heterogeneously integrated two dimensional (2D) materials from an extensive library of atomic 2D materials with selectable material properties to open up fascinating possibilities for the design of functional novel devices. Since the discovery of Graphene by Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov, 2D materials, e.g., graphene, black phosphorous (BP), transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) have attracted extensive attention due to their broad physical properties and wide range of applications to electronic and optoelectronic devices. Research on these 2D materials has matured to the point where an extensive library of atomically thin 2D materials with selectable material properties has been created and continues to grow. By combining or stacking these 2D materials, it is possible to construct 2D heterostructures, which are built by directly stacking individual monolayers comprising different materials. Each monolayer within a 2D heterostructure is highly stable, due to strong covalent bonds between the atoms within that monolayer. However, the forces between the monolayers that keep said monolayers stacked one above the other to form the 2D heterostructure happen to be relatively weak van der Waals interactions."</em> <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-03/ws-cro030620.php">[...]</a>

Although 2D-materials–based technologies have not yet been widely used in commercial applications, the materials have been the subject of considerable research interest. In the future, they could be the basis for semiconductors in ever smaller electronics, quantum computer components, more-efficient batteries, or filters capable of extracting freshwater from saltwater. The promise of 2D materials comes from certain properties that differ from how the same elements or compounds behave when they appear in greater quantities. Those unique characteristics are influenced by quantum effects — phenomena occurring at extremely small scales that are fundamentally different from the classical physics seen at larger scales. For instance, when carbon is arranged in an atomically thin layer to form 2D graphene, it is stronger than steel, conducts heat better than any other known material, and has almost zero electrical resistance."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/3d-images-of-2d-materials">[...]</a>

Replacing the traditional graphite-based anodes with Li metal, a "holy" anode with a high theoretical capacity of 3860 mAh/g, shows it a promising approach. At present, Li metal anode suffers from poor cycling efficiency and infinite volume change, raising operational safety concerns.

Metal-air batteries (MABs), in which oxygen from the atmosphere reacts with metals to generate electricity, are one of the lightest and most compact types of batteries. They are equipped with anodes made up of pure metals (i.e."</em> <a href="https://news.unist.ac.kr/new-catalyst-provides-boost-to-next-generation-ev-batteries/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A machine learning framework has been created to precisely locate atom-sized quantum bits in silicon – a crucial step for building a large-scale silicon quantum computer Quantum computers are expected to offer tremendous computational power for complex problems­ –currently intractable even on supercomputers – in the areas of drug design, data science, astronomy and materials chemistry among others. The high technological and strategic stakes mean major technology companies as well as ambitious start-ups and government-funded research centres are all in the race to build the world’s first universal quantum computer. BUILDING A QUANTUM COMPUTER In contrast to today’s classical computers, where information is encoded in bits (0 or 1), quantum computers process information stored in quantum bits (qubits). These are hosted by quantum mechanical objects like electrons, the negatively charged particles of an atom. Quantum states can also be binary and can be put in one of two possibilities, or effectively both at the same time – known as quantum superposition – offering an exponentially larger computational space with an increasing number of qubits. This unique data crunching power is further boosted by entanglement, another magical property of quantum mechanics where the state of one qubit is able to dictate the state of another qubit without any physical connection, making them all 1’s for example."</em> <a href="https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/machine-learning-to-scale-up-the-quantum-computer">[...]</a>

<p><em>"KAIST researchers developed a three-dimensional (3D) hierarchically porous nanostructured catalyst with carbon dioxide (CO2) to carbon monoxide (CO) conversion rate up to 3.96 times higher than that of conventional nanoporous gold catalysts. This new catalyst helps overcome the existing limitations of the mass transport that has been a major cause of decreases in the CO2 conversion rate, holding a strong promise for the large-scale and cost-effective electrochemical conversion of CO2 into useful chemicals. As CO2 emissions increase and fossil fuels deplete globally, reducing and converting CO2 to clean energy electrochemically has attracted a great deal of attention as a promising technology. Especially due to the fact that the CO2 reduction reaction occurs competitively with hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) at similar redox potentials, the development of an efficient electrocatalyst for selective and robust CO2 reduction reactions has remained a key technological issue. Gold (Au) is one of the most commonly used catalysts in CO2 reduction reactions, but the high cost and scarcity of Au pose obstacles for mass commercial applications. The development of nanostructures has been extensively studied as a potential approach to improving the selectivity for target products and maximizing the number of active stable sites, thus enhancing the energy efficiency."</em> <a href="http://news.kaist.ac.kr/newsen/html/news/?mode=V&amp;mng_no=6470">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Columbia Engineers first to demonstrate a robotic finger with a highly precise sense of touch over a complex, multicurved surface Researchers at Columbia Engineering announced today that they have introduced a new type of robotic finger with a sense of touch. Their finger can localize touch with very high precision—&lt;1mm—over a large, multicurved surface, much like its human counterpart. “There has long been a gap between stand-alone tactile sensors and fully integrated tactile fingers--tactile sensing is still far from ubiquitous in robotic manipulation,” says Matei Ciocarlie, associate professor in the departments of mechanical engineering and computer science, who led this work in collaboration with Electrical Engineering Professor Ioannis (John) Kymissis. “In this paper, we have demonstrated a multicurved robotic finger with accurate touch localization and normal force detection over complex 3D surfaces.” Current methods for building touch sensors have proven difficult to integrate into robot fingers due to multiple challenges, including difficulty in covering multicurved surfaces, high wire count, or difficulty fitting into small fingertips, thus preventing use in dexterous hands. The Columbia Engineering team took a new approach: the novel use of overlapping signals from light emitters and receivers embedded in a transparent waveguide layer that covers the functional areas of the finger. By measuring light transport between every emitter and receiver, they showed that they can obtain a very rich signal data set that changes in response to deformation of the finger due to touch."</em> <a href="https://engineering.columbia.edu/press-releases/ciocarlie-tactile-robot-finger">[...]</a>

To minimize the amount of computation required by the Arduino, I used a technique called granular synthesis to manipulate the incoming audio signal. Essentially, as audio comes into the Arduino it gets cut up and stored as small (millisecond or microsecond sized) samples called "grains." These grains are then individually manipulated and played back; they may be lengthened or shortened, stretched or compressed, played back in reverse, copied several times, or mixed with other grains."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Vocal-Effects-Box/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"We had a large space on part of our living room wall for which we could never find the right 'thing' to hang on it. After trying for several years we decided to make something of our own. This turned out rather well (in our opinion) so I turned it into a project on my Youtube channel and a written Instructable which you're reading right now! It's a giant digital LED clock discreetly hidden in the edges of a geometric shelving system. It also included integrated LED downlighters to show off your favorite items on the shelves. As the lighting is LED (using WS2821B 'Neopixels') you can choose your own colours - both for the clock face and downlighters."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Build-a-Giant-Hidden-Shelf-Edge-Clock/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"So, you play music live, and you use metronome or click-tracks to synchronize your band. What if I told you that you can use that click-track to tell your amp to switch between channel by itself, in the exact time you need it, without you actually stomping on the footswitch? If you are like me, you try to put up the best show you can. But it's not as easy as it looks. You have to pay attention to a lot of things while playing; avoid mistakes in your playing/singing, remember the changes of the song, move around the stage, interact with the crowd, etc. Im not a trained musician, and though for most people all of this challenges can be overcome with practice and a lot of preparation; for me can be a bit overwhelming at times."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Footswitch-control-Your-Guitar-Amp-With-Ar/">[...]</a>
