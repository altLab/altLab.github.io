<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1862, o cientista britânico <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Henry_Bragg">William Henry Bragg</a>. Ele foi pioneiro em física do estado sólido e foi-lhe concedido (em conjunto com o seu filho Sir Lawrence Bragg) o Prémio Nobel de Física em 1915 pelas pesquisas sobre a determinação de estruturas cristalinas. Durante a Primeira Guerra Mundial, Bragg foi encarregado de pesquisas sobre a detecção e medição de sons subaquáticos para a localização de submarinos. Ele também construiu um espectrómetro de raios-X para medir os comprimentos de onda dos raios-X.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1876, a Física nuclear canadiana <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriet_Brooks">Harriet Brooks</a>. Ela foi provavelmente a primeira a observar o recuo do núcleo atómico quando partículas nucleares foram emitidas durante o decaimento radioactivo. Durante os anos de 1901-05, ela contribuiu muito para a nova ciência da radioactividade. Trabalhando com Ernest Rutherford, ela mediu a taxa na qual o rádio libertava rádon (e outros gases) no ar. Eles demonstraram que a difusão das emanações de rádio comportava-se como um gás e que esse gás tinha um peso molecular alto (acima de 100). Rutherford deu crédito ao seu trabalho ao identificar a libertação de rádon como crucial para o desenvolvimento da sua teoria da transmutação de um elemento em outro.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1893, o físico germano-britânico <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Simon">Francis Simon</a>. O seu trabalho em física de baixa temperatura alcançou uma baixa de 20 milionésimos de grau acima do zero absoluto. Ele evitou a vida na Alemanha de Hitler indo para Oxford. Simon trabalhou na redução de temperaturas abaixo do ponto anteriormente possível pelo efeito Joule-Thomson. O seu método era retirar calor alinhando moléculas para-magnéticas em temperaturas muito baixas e permitir que sua orientação se aleatorizasse, abstraindo mais calor do ambiente e diminuindo ainda mais a temperatura. Ele chegou mais perto do zero absoluto, embora com mais dificuldade, fazendo o mesmo com rotações nucleares.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1906, o físico germano-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Bethe">Hans Bethe</a>. Ele ajudou a moldar a física clássica na física quântica e aumentou a compreensão dos processos atómicos responsáveis pelas propriedades da matéria e das forças que governam as estruturas dos núcleos atómicos. Bethe trabalhou com relação à penetração de armaduras e à teoria das ondas de choque de um projéctil em movimento no ar. Ele estudou reacções nucleares e secções transversais de reacção. Em 1943, Robert Oppenheimer pediu a Bethe para ser o chefe da Divisão Teórica em Los Alamos no Projecto Manhattan. Ele recebeu o Prémio Nobel de Física (1967) pelo seu trabalho na produção de energia em estrelas.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou a SpaceX lançou um satélite de GPS para a Força Espacial Norte-Americana. Esta foi a 11a missão da SpaceX bem sucedida. Um foguetão Falcon 9 foi lançado no passado dia 30 do Cape Canaveral na Florida. Construído pela Lockheed Martin, este é o terceiro satélite GPS do género a ser lançado e juntar-se-á a outros dois como ele, que já estão em órbita. A SpaceX lançou um desses dois satélites num foguete Falcon 9 diferente em Dezembro de 2018 e o outro satélite foi lançado no último foguete Delta IV Medium em Agosto de 2019.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos assim como projetos de maker.</p>

<p><em>"SpaceX successfully launched its 11th mission of the year, lofting a next-generation global positioning satellite into space for the U.S. Space Force. A shiny, white Falcon 9 rocket took to the skies today (June 30) at 4:10 p.m. EDT (2010 GMT), taking off from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Today’s launch is part of an ongoing effort by the Department of Defense to upgrade GPS satellites currently in space. The constellation of aging GPS satellites was launched roughly 20 years ago and technology has changed significantly in that time. The particular satellite launched today will replace one of the oldest ones in orbit. Built by Lockheed Martin, this is the third GPS satellite of its kind to launch and will join two others just like it that are already in orbit."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-space-force-gps-3-sv03-launch-success.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.microchip.com/en/pressreleasepage/smallest-automotive-maxtouch-controllers">Microchip Delivers the Smallest Automotive maXTouch Controllers for Smart Surfaces and Multi-function Displays</a></h2>

<p><em>"New touch controller family offers multi-finger thick glove and weather-proof operation in a turn-key solution for easy integration To help enhance and ease today’s driving experience, automotive manufacturers are implementing additional touch displays beyond the center infotainment display (CID). Supporting the application of these secondary displays with advanced features, Microchip Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP) today announced the extension of its market-leading maXTouch® portfolio with the new MXT288UD touch controller family, the industry’s smallest automotive grade packaged touch screen controllers. The MXT288UD-AM and the MXT144UD-AM devices offer low power mode, weatherproof operation and glove touch detection in multi-function displays, touch pad and smart surfaces for vehicles, motorcycles, e-bikes and car-sharing services. Secondary touch surfaces can be placed in both the interior of cars and exterior of a motor vehicle, such as handlebars, doors, electronic mirrors, control knobs, the steering wheel, between seats or in an armrest. With the MXT288UD family’s small 7x7 mm automotive grade VQFN56 package, tier one suppliers can now reduce board space by 75 percent and greatly minimize the overall Bill of Materials (BoM) for these compact applications — all while exceeding the requirements for excellent and reliable touch performance in the market. The family’s low power wait-for-touch mode consumes less than 50 µA, remaining responsive for the user, even if the display switches off to save power or to avoid disturbing the driver at night."</em> <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en/pressreleasepage/smallest-automotive-maxtouch-controllers">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://toshiba.semicon-storage.com/ap-en/company/news/news-topics/2020/06/opto-20200629-1.html">Toshiba Releases Industry’s First Photocouplers for High-Speed Communications that can Operate from 2.2V</a></h2>

<p><em>"Toshiba Electronic Devices &amp; Storage Corporation (“Toshiba”) has released the industry’s first[1] photocouplers for high-speed communications that can operate with a power supply as low as 2.2V. The two devices are the “TLP2312,” which delivers at typical data transfer rate of 5Mbps, and the 20Mbps “TLP2372.” Shipments start today. The new products are designed to operate at low voltage, starting at 2.2V, so as to work with the lower voltages of the peripheral circuits, even when used in such low level voltage circuits as 2.5V LVCMOS. This approach eliminates the need for a separate power supply to drive the photocouplers, reducing the component count. With a low threshold input current of 1.6mA (max), and low supply current of 0.5mA (max) in their -40℃ and +125℃ operating temperature range, the new photocouplers can be directly driven by microcontrollers, reducing power consumption. The new photocouplers are housed in 5-pin SO6 package with a maximum height of 2.3mm, securing a low profile and bringing greater freedom to component layout on printed circuit boards."</em> <a href="https://toshiba.semicon-storage.com/ap-en/company/news/news-topics/2020/06/opto-20200629-1.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/p4272.html">STMicroelectronics Expands STM32WL Wireless Microcontroller Ecosystem with wM-Bus Stack for Smart Metering from Stackforce</a></h2>

<p><em>"STMicroelectronics (NYSE: STM), a global semiconductor leader serving customers across the spectrum of electronics applications, and Stackforce – an ST Authorized Partner – have announced a wireless M-Bus (wM-Bus) software stack that leverages the integrated sub-GHz radio and multiple modulation schemes supported by STM32WL microcontrollers to cut bill-of-materials cost and enhance flexibility for developers of smart-metering systems. Developed by Stackforce, the wM-Bus stack complies with most of EN 13757-3/-7, covering the upper layers of the Wireless M-Bus protocol stack, as well as the lower layers (EN 13757-4) and its wM-Bus modes S, T, and C used throughout Europe in the 868MHz band. The mode N for operation at 169MHz is an option, too. In addition, it meets several other metering standards, including the most common Open Metering System (OMS) specification, as well as more specific standards like Dutch Smart Meter Requirements (DSMR) or CIG Italian Gas Committee specifications. Hakim Jaafar, Marketing Manager STM32 Wireless products at STMicroelectronics said: “Thanks to our collaboration with Stackforce, STM32WL is reaching a new level of multi-protocol compatibility. With this wireless wM-Bus stack, the STM32WL can become the key product for a wide range of smart-metering applications such as electricity, gas and water metering.“ David Rahusen, Managing Director at Stackforce, said: “We’re proud to be chosen by ST for collaboration on the next level of embedded integration."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/p4272.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The Mbed team are pleased to announce the release of Mbed OS 6.1, following fast on the heels of our 6.0 release. A major feature we have introduced in this release aims to improve your experience with Arm’s Platform Security Architecture when used in conjunction with Mbed OS. Platform Security Architecture, or PSA, is an Arm- led framework for securing IoT devices. Arm has been working in close collaboration with a broader ecosystem to establish both a certification scheme, involving a number of test labs and security consultants, and to provide a reference software implementation of the PSA Root of Trust, via the Trusted Firmware project. We first released support for PSA in Mbed OS back in our 5.12 release in March 2019. In a PSA system, the software stack is split between a Secure environment, where we strongly recommend the use of the reference TF-M (Trusted Firmware-M) software from the Trusted Firmware project, and the Non-secure environment, which is where Mbed OS is used."</em> <a href="https://os.mbed.com/blog/entry/Arm-Mbed-OS-61-released/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://blog.arduino.cc/2020/07/02/arduino-security-primer/">Arduino Security Primer</a></h2>

<p><em>"At Arduino, we are hard at work to keep improving the security of our hardware and software products, and we would like to run you through how our IoT Cloud service works. The Arduino IoT Cloud‘s security is based on three key elements: The open-source library ArduinoBearSSL for implementing TLS protocol on Arduino boards; A hardware secure element (Microchip ATECCX08A) to guarantee authenticity and confidentiality during communication; A device certificate provisioning process to allow client authentication during MQTT sessions. ArduinoBearSSL In the past, it has been challenging to create a complete SSL/TLS library implementation on embedded (constrained) devices with very limited resources. An Arduino MKR WiFi 1010, for instance, only has 32KB of RAM while the standard SSL/TLS protocol implementations were designed for more powerful devices with ~256MB of RAM. As of today, a lot of embedded devices still do not properly implement the full SSL/TLS stack and fail to implement good security because they misuse or strip functionalities from the library, e.g. we found out that a lot of off-brand boards use code that does not actually validate the server’s certificate, making them an easy target for server impersonation and man-in-the-middle attacks."</em> <a href="https://blog.arduino.cc/2020/07/02/arduino-security-primer/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"An international collaboration team of University California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and EPFL has developed an integrated technology that may revolutionize photonic systems. Information technology continues to progress at a rapid pace. However, the growing demands of data centers have pushed electrical input-output systems to their physical limit, which has created a bottleneck. Maintaining this growth will require a shift in how we built computers. The future is optical. Over the last decade, the field of photonics has provided a solution to the chip-to-chip bandwidth problem in the electronic world by increasing the link distance between servers with higher bandwidth, far less energy, and lower latency compared to electrical interconnects."</em> <a href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/photonics-from-custom-built-to-ready-made/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.ims.ac.jp/en/news/2020/06/23_4695.html">A Metal-like Quantum Gas: A pathbreaking platform for quantum simulation</a></h2>

<p><em>"Coherent and ultrafast laser excitation creates an exotic matter phase with spatially overlapping electronic wave-functions under nanometric control in an artificial micro-crystal of ultracold atoms. This exotic metal-like quantum gas under exquisite control and long-lived, decaying in nanoseconds, opens up a completely new regime of many-body physics for simulating ultrafast many-body electron dynamics dominated by Coulomb interactions. Electronic properties of condensed matter are often determined by an intricate competition between kinetic energy that aims to overlap and delocalize electronic wave functions across the crystal lattice, and localizing electron-electron interactions. In contrast, the gaseous phase is characterized by valence electrons tightly localized around the ionic atom cores in discrete quantum states with well-defined energies. As an exotic hybrid of both situations, one may wonder which state of matter is created when a gas of isolated atoms is suddenly excited to a state where electronic wave functions spatially overlap like in a solid? Such an exotic phase of matter, however, has so far been impossible to be created in principle."</em> <a href="https://www.ims.ac.jp/en/news/2020/06/23_4695.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Device makes it easy for scientists to access high-quality images from deep inside tissue Researchers have developed a new plug-and-play device that can add adaptive optics correction to commercial optical microscopes. Adaptive optics can greatly improve the quality of images acquired deep into biological samples, but has, until now, been extremely complex to implement. “Improving the technology available to life scientists can further our understanding of biology, which will, in turn, lead to better drugs and therapies available to doctors,” said research team leader, Paolo Pozzi from the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia in Italy. In The Optical Society (OSA) journal Optics Letters, Pozzi and a multidisciplinary team of researchers from Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), CNR-Institute for Photonics and Nanotechnology (CNR-IFL) and University Medical Center Rotterdam describe their new adaptive lens device. They also show how it can be easily installed onto the objective lens of a commercial multiphoton microscope to improve image quality. “This approach will allow advanced optical techniques such as multiphoton microscopy to image deeper under the surface of the brain in live organisms,” said Stefano Bonora, group leader at the CNR-IFL."</em> <a href="https://www.osa.org/en-us/about_osa/newsroom/news_releases/2020/plug-and-play_lens_simplifies_adaptive_optics_for/">[...]</a>

To the surprise of researchers, recent experimentation on spall fracture in metals found that, in certain cases, there was an almost complete lack of damage with only a thin band of altered microstructure observed. Usually, under these sorts of conditions, the material would contain hundreds of small voids and cracks.

<p><em>"Study shows LIGO’s 40-kilogram mirrors can move in response to tiny quantum effects, revealing the “spooky popcorn of the universe.” The universe, as seen through the lens of quantum mechanics, is a noisy, crackling space where particles blink constantly in and out of existence, creating a background of quantum noise whose effects are normally far too subtle to detect in everyday objects. Now for the first time, a team led by researchers at MIT LIGO Laboratory has measured the effects of quantum fluctuations on objects at the human scale. In a paper published today in Nature, the researchers report observing that quantum fluctuations, tiny as they may be, can nonetheless “kick” an object as large as the 40-kilogram mirrors of the U.S. National Science Foundation’s Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), causing them to move by a tiny degree, which the team was able to measure. It turns out the quantum noise in LIGO’s detectors is enough to move the large mirrors by 10-20 meters — a displacement that was predicted by quantum mechanics for an object of this size, but that had never before been measured. “A hydrogen atom is 10-10 meters, so this displacement of the mirrors is to a hydrogen atom what a hydrogen atom is to us — and we measured that,” says Lee McCuller, a research scientist at MIT’s Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research. The researchers used a special instrument that they designed, called a quantum squeezer, to “manipulate the detector’s quantum noise and reduce its kicks to the mirrors, in a way that could ultimately improve LIGO’s sensitivity in detecting gravitational waves,” explains Haocun Yu, a physics graduate student at MIT."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/quantum-fluctuations-jiggle-objects-0701">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Photocathodes that produce electron beams for electron microscopes and advanced accelerators can be refreshed and rebuilt repeatedly without opening the devices that rely on them, provided the electron emitting materials are deposited on single-atom-thick layers of carbon known as graphene, according to a new study published in the journal Applied Physics Letters. “The machines that rely on these electron emitters typically operate under high vacuum,” said Los Alamos National Laboratory physicist Hisato Yamaguchi. “By choosing graphene over materials like silicon or molybdenum, which tend to degrade during use, we can clean the substrate and redeposit electron-emitting materials without opening the vacuum. This can dramatically reduce downtime and labor involved in replacing photocathodes.” The researchers studied photocathodes made of cesium potassium antimonide, which efficiently emit electrons when illuminated with high-power, green laser light. The photocathode efficiency falls with use, and the photocathodes must be either replaced or renewed with the electron-emitting material baked off and replaced in situ. When the researchers renewed photocathodes on substrates of silicon or molybdenum, which are common materials for such devices, the photocathode performance degraded with each cycle."</em> <a href="https://www.lanl.gov/discover/news-release-archive/2020/June/0630-graphene-electron-sources.php">[...]</a>

<p><em>"World's widest graphene nanoribbon promises the next generation of miniaturized electronics Materials Science 2020/07/01 With literally the thickness of one carbon atom and electrical properties that can surpass those of standard semiconductor technologies, graphene nanoribbons promise a new generation of miniaturized electronic devices. The theory, however, remains far ahead of reality, with current graphene nanoribbons falling short of their potential. A new collaborative study seen in Communications Materials by a project of CREST, JST Japan including Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST), Fujitsu Laboratories Ltd. and Fujitsu Ltd., and the University of Tokyo reports the first ever 17-carbon wide graphene nanoribbon and confirms it has the smallest bandgap seen to date among known graphene nanoribbons prepared by a bottom-up manner. Large-scale integrated circuits (LSIs) that use silicon semiconductors are used in a wide range of electronic devices, anywhere from computers to smartphones. They are actually supporting our lives and almost everything else these days. However, although LSIs have improved device performance by reducing the size of the devices, LSI miniaturization is approaching its limit."</em> <a href="https://www.naist.jp/en/research_achievements/2020/07/007122.html">[...]</a>

It’s become increasingly critical to keep these heavy droplets from lingering - especially on surfaces, which are welcoming and generous hosts. Thankfully, our chemical cleaning products can do wonders to take them down, but in larger settings it can be expensive, dangerous, and time-consuming. Across the globe there are thousands of warehouses, grocery stores, schools and other spaces where cleaning workers are at risk. With that in mind, a team from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), in collaboration with Ava Robotics and the Greater Boston Food Bank (GBFB), designed a new robotic system that powerfully disinfects surfaces and neutralizes aerosolized forms of the coronavirus. The approach uses a custom UVC light fixture designed at CSAIL that is integrated with Ava Robotics’ mobile robot base."</em> <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/news/csail-robot-disinfects-greater-boston-food-bank-fight-covid-19">[...]</a>

These sensors, made from electrically conducting yarns, pick up hand motions and finger placements that stand for individual letters, numbers, words and phrases. The device then turns the finger movements into electrical signals, which are sent to a dollar-coin–sized circuit board worn on the wrist."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/glove-translates-sign-language-to-speech">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Music gesture artificial intelligence tool developed at the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab uses body movements to isolate the sounds of individual instruments. We listen to music with our ears, but also our eyes, watching with appreciation as the pianist’s fingers fly over the keys and the violinist’s bow rocks across the ridge of strings. When the ear fails to tell two instruments apart, the eye often pitches in by matching each musician’s movements to the beat of each part. A new artificial intelligence tool developed by the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab leverages the virtual eyes and ears of a computer to separate similar sounds that are tricky even for humans to differentiate. The tool improves on earlier iterations by matching the movements of individual musicians, via their skeletal keypoints, to the tempo of individual parts, allowing listeners to isolate a single flute or violin among multiple flutes or violins. Potential applications for the work range from sound mixing, and turning up the volume of an instrument in a recording, to reducing the confusion that leads people to talk over one another on a video-conference calls."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/music-gesture-artificial-intelligence-identifies-melody-by-musician-body-language-0625">[...]</a>

<p><em>"UNIGE scientists have fine-tuned a neuro-computer model, combining neuronal oscillations and predictive coding, which helps explain how the brain identifies syllables in natural speech. The brain analyses spoken language by recognising syllables. Scientists from the University of Geneva (UNIGE) and the Evolving Language National Centre for Competence in Research (NCCR) have designed a computational model that reproduces the complex mechanism employed by the central nervous system to perform this operation. The model, which brings together two independent theoretical frameworks, uses the equivalent of neuronal oscillations produced by brain activity to process the continuous sound flow of connected speech. The model functions according to a theory known as predictive coding, whereby the brain optimizes perception by constantly trying to predict the sensory signals based on candidate hypotheses (syllables in this model). The resulting model, described in the journal Nature Communications, has helped the live recognition of thousands of syllables contained in hundreds of sentences spoken in natural language."</em> <a href="https://www.unige.ch/communication/communiques/en/2020/computational-model-decodes-speech-by-predicting-it/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers at Virginia Commonwealth University and the University of California, Los Angeles have made an important advance that could lead to more energy efficient magnetic memory storage components for computers and other devices. Magnets are widely used for computer memory because their “up” or “down” polarity — the magnetic state — can be “flipped” to write or encode data and store information. Magnetic memory is nonvolatile, so information can be stored on devices without refreshing. However, magnetic memory also requires a lot of energy. A recently discovered magnetic state called the skyrmion, which is neither “up” nor “down” but flower-shaped, offers a solution. Manipulating the skyrmion state allows for much more efficient, robust data storage for conventional computers and wireless smart devices."</em> <a href="https://news.vcu.edu/article/Study_reveals_new_magnetic_process_that_can_lead_to_more_energyefficient">[...]</a>

This project uses a distance sensor to detect if a cup or glass has been placed under the water output, the fountain will then proceed to output water for 60 seconds (100ml / minute). This is to make it more consistent because detecting if the glass has been pulled away proved to be too difficult/slow of a task which is why a timer was put in place. After your glass has been filled with 100ml of water you can wait for 5 seconds and if the glass is still in front of the distance sensor it will proceed to fill another time (this means there is also a timeout of 5 seconds between filling two different items)."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Contactless-Water-Fountain/">[...]</a>

Before starting any work on the workbench for the tool mounts I wanted to figure out a way how I can easily turn on and off all of the power tools attached to it as the tool power switches will be under the table. The easiest solution for it is to mount a power strip on the bench and have its switch exposed so it can be pressed. However, I dont think that this is a safe option as the cables will also be exposed and I could accidentally turn on the switch."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/SSR-Latching-Circuit-With-Push-Buttons/">[...]</a>

Another reason why I wanted to do this is to have more practical knowledge and hands-on experience in the Reinforcement Learning domain. Since with this Robot Arm, I saw the potential to learn physical action control which will translate in world changes that can be virtual, opening up the realm of possibilities for use cases. To make this post more understandable, I decided to do an in-depth coverage over multiple articles. In the first part I will detail how this Robotic Arm extension was built and how you can make the robot arm control the right tuhmbstick when you are moving with the left thumbstick. While in the second part, I will go deeper on how we are then able to utilize a Unity Environment and train it to eventually be controlled by the robotic arm."</em> <a href="https://xaviergeerinck.com/post/ai/rl/xbox-robot-arm-creation/">[...]</a>
