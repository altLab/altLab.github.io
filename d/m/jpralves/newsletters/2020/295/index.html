<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1818, o físico inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Prescott_Joule">James Prescott Joule</a>. Ele estabeleceu que as várias formas de energia - mecânica, eléctrica e térmica - são basicamente as mesmas e podem ser transformadas umas nas outras. Assim, ele formou a base da lei da conservação da energia, a primeira lei da termodinâmica. Ele descobriu em 1840 a relação entre corrente eléctrica, resistência e a quantidade de calor produzida. Em 1849, ele desenvolveu a teoria cinética dos gases e, um ano depois, anunciou o equivalente mecânico do calor. Mais tarde, com William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), ele descobriu o efeito Joule-Thomson. A unidade SI de energia ou trabalho, o joule (símbolo J), tem o seu nome. É definido como o trabalho realizado quando uma força de 1 newton move-se a uma distância de 1 metro na direcção da força.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1822, o matemático francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Hermite">Charles Hermite</a>. Ele desenvolveu trabalho na teoria das funções incluindo a aplicação de funções elípticas para fornecer a primeira solução para a equação geral do quinto grau, a equação quíntica. Em 1873, ele publicou a primeira prova de que 'e' é um número transcendental. Hermite também é conhecido por uma série de entidades matemáticas que levam seu nome, polinómios de Hermite, equação diferencial de Hermite, fórmula de interpolação de Hermite e matrizes de Hermite. Poincaré é o mais conhecido dos alunos de Hermite.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1854, o físico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Elster">Julius Elster</a>. Ele e Hans Geitel construíram a primeira célula fotoeléctrica e o fotómetro fotoeléctrico como parte do seu estudo do efeito fotoeléctrico e da emissão de electrões térmicos. Eles recusaram-se a patentear estas invenções, preferindo partilhar os benefícios. A partir de 1884, eles pesquisaram fenómenos eléctricos em gases, electricidade atmosférica, mediram o campo eléctrico da Terra e, em 1899, foram os primeiros a determinar a carga das gotas de chuva que caem de nuvens de tempestade. Quando investigaram a radioactividade, consideraram que se devia a uma libertação espontânea de energia pelos átomos. Eles mostraram que o chumbo não é em si radioactivo e que a condutividade da atmosfera se deve à ionização de substâncias radioactivas.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1956, o empreendedor norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kirsch">Steve Kirsch</a>. Ele inventou e possui a patente de uma versão inicial do rato óptico, fundou o Infoseek, um dos primeiros mecanismos de busca da Internet, e ajudou a criar o FrameMaker, uma ferramenta de publicação popular usada por escritores técnicos.</p>

<p>Faz hoje 16 anos que a Cassini libertou a sonda Huygens. A sonda Huygens iniciou uma descida de 22 dias em direcção à maior lua de Saturno, Titã. Ela tinha sido lançada como parte da nave Cassini em 1997 e, juntas, elas entraram na órbita de Saturno em Junho de 2004. À medida que os caminhos da nave e de Titã convergiam, a Cassini ejectou a sonda Huygens, enviando-a em direcção à lua coberta de nuvens. Ela pousou a 14 de Janeiro de 2005 e enviou fotogramas da superfície da lua. A Cassini permaneceria em órbita a volta de Saturno pelo menos até Julho de 2008. A missão Cassini-Huygens para estudar Saturno e suas 33 luas conhecidas resultou de um esforço cooperativo sem precedentes entre a NASA dos Estados Unidos, a Agência Espacial Europeia e o programa espacial da Itália.</p>

<p><em>"In response to incredible customer demand, Intel has doubled its combined 14nm and 10nm manufacturing capacity over the past few years. To do this, the company found innovative ways to deliver more output within existing capacity through yield improvement projects and significant investments in capacity expansion. This video recounts that journey, which even included repurposing existing lab and office space for manufacturing. “Over the last three years, we have doubled our wafer volume capacity, and that was a significant investment. Moving forward, we’re not stopping… We are continuing to invest into factory capacity to ensure we can keep up with the growing needs of our customers,” says Keyvan Esfarjani, senior vice president and general manager of Manufacturing and Operations at Intel. The company also ramped its new 10nm process this year."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news/10nm-creative-improvements-expand-intel-manufacturing-capacity/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Toshiba Corporation has developed a new magnetic material with characteristics that deliver major improvements in motor efficiency at minimum cost, and with the potential to win significant reductions in power consumption, necessary toward achieving a low-carbon future. Motors account for approximately half of the world's electric power consumption. Any advance that can improve their efficiency promises major benefits to society as a whole, and will help to promote the shift to a carbon-free economy. Toshiba’s new material greatly boosts motor energy conversion efficiency when it is used as the wedges in the motor, particularly in the medium to large induction motor(Note 1). The material can be installed at minimal cost with no need for design changes. Through testing in an induction motor in the railway rolling stock drive systems, Toshiba confirmed an efficiency increase of 0.9 pt(Note 2), with an improvement approaching the efficiency of permanent magnet synchronous motors(Note 3)."</em> <a href="https://www.toshiba.co.jp/rdc/rd/detail_e/e2012_01.html?from=RSS_PRESS&amp;uid=20201222-7023e">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The rendezvous of the double planets was often grafted onto apocalyptic prophecies, says University of Rochester historian Laura Ackerman Smoller. Astronomers and amateur star gazers alike are training their telescopes on the evening sky for a heavenly spectacle when the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn is more visible from earth than it’s been in nearly 800 years. The celestial event will play out on Monday—this year’s winter solstice—when our solar system’s two largest planets appear side by side above the horizon soon after sunset. It’s been nearly eight centuries since the pair of planets appeared in conjunction this close to Earth. In 1623, a similar conjunction of the planets occurred, but on the same side of the sky as the sun, which meant it wasn’t visible from the Blue Planet. Monday’s conjunction will be the first visible occurrence since before the time of Marco Polo."</em> <a href="https://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/jupiter-saturn-conjunction-medieval-renaissance-europe-465032/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://news.st-andrews.ac.uk/archive/the-lightest-light-the-future-of-digital-displays-and-brain-science/">The lightest light – the future of digital displays and brain science</a></h2>

<p><em>"A team of scientists from the University of St Andrews has developed a new way of making the most durable, lightweight and thinnest light source available so far, which could revolutionise the future of mobile technologies and pave the way for new advances in brain science. Writing in two separate papers and published in Nature Communications today (Monday 7 December), the new research into the development of organic LEDs, led by the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of St Andrews, has implications not only for the future designs of mobile phones and tablets but could also play a key role in neuroscience research and clinical technologies used to help patients who suffer from neurological diseases. Using a combination of organic electroluminescent molecules, metal oxide and biocompatible polymer protection layers, the scientists created organic LEDs that are as thin and flexible as the everyday cling film we use at home. The new light sources developed will have future implications for digital displays and can be used to make lighter and thinner displays for phones and tablets; displays that are big when we look at them, but that can be folded or rolled up when not in use. In the longer term, these new LEDs could also see use in treatments for neurological diseases in which light-gated proteins are deployed to modulate brain activity in patients. Earlier attempts to develop ultra-thin organic LEDs found they struggled with poor stability in air and moist environments."</em> <a href="https://news.st-andrews.ac.uk/archive/the-lightest-light-the-future-of-digital-displays-and-brain-science/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A single semiconducting material can produce white light by emitting light across the visible spectrum. The advantages of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), such as their tiny size, low cost and excellent power efficiency, mean they are found everywhere in modern life. A KAUST team has recently developed a way of producing a white-light LED that overcomes some critical challenges. Blinking away on almost every modern electronic device, LEDs transmit messages in their own distinct shade of red, green or blue. The coloration of an LED comes from a semiconductor inside that emits over a narrow spectrum of optical wavelengths. The inability of LEDs to emit across a wider spectrum restricts their use in lighting applications — emitting a wider spectrum is necessary to generate white light — or for displays that require a wide palette of different colors."</em> <a href="https://discovery.kaust.edu.sa/en/article/1068/optoelectronic-devices-that-emit-warm-and-cool-white-light">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Rice scientists show how coated nanoantennas retain energy to potentially catalyze chemical reactions Bigger is not always better, but here’s something that starts small and gets better as it gets bigger. Just light it up and see. A team led by Rice University chemists Christy Landes and Stephan Link, both associated with the Smalley-Curl Institute, have made hybrid particles that combine the unbeatable light-harvesting properties of plasmonic nanoparticles with the flexibility of catalytic polymer coatings. Their work could help power long-pursued plasmonic applications in electronics, imaging, sensing and medicine. Plasmons are the detectable ripples of energy created on the surface of some metals when excited by light or other input. Nanoantennas are microscopic bits of these metals, like gold, silver and aluminum."</em> <a href="https://news.rice.edu/2020/12/22/soft-nanoparticles-give-plasmons-new-potential-2/">[...]</a>

Right now, the first prototypes are already performing the simplest manipulations. In the future, robotic chemists will be able to run their own research for accumulating large amounts of data and performing primary analysis. It takes a long time to conduct chemical experiments and analyze their results. Any researcher can mix reagents, but for some experiments these tasks have to be performed hundreds of times with all proportions kept exactly the same.

<p><em>"The breakthrough, made by researchers at Caltech, Fermilab and NASA, among others, is a step towards a practical quantum internet. In a major breakthrough for the quest toward quantum internet, a technology that would revolutionize computing in myriad ways, a consortium of well-regarded institutions have announced the first demonstration of sustained, high-fidelity quantum teleportation over long distances. Led by Caltech, a collaboration between Fermilab, AT&amp;T, Harvard University, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and the University of Calgary reports the successful teleportation of qubits, basic units of quantum information, across 22 kilometers of fiber in two testbeds: the Caltech Quantum Network and the Fermilab Quantum Network. “The team has been working persistently and keeping our heads down in the past few years,” said Maria Spiropulu, a particle physicist at Caltech who directs the INQNET research program and co-authored the new paper, in an email. Though the collaboration knew it had “achieved significant results” by the spring of 2020, Spiropulu added, they refrained from sharing the news, even informally on social media, until the publication of the full study this week. “We wanted to push the envelope for this type of research and take important steps on a path to realize both real-life applications for quantum communications and networks and test fundamental physics ideas,” said Panagiotis Spentzouris, head of the Quantum Science Program at Fermilab, in an email."</em> <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93wqep/researchers-have-achieved-sustained-long-distance-quantum-teleportation">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Despite significant advances in wireless technology, the manufacturing industry continues to turn to wired forms of communication such as Ethernet or fibre optics for its most critical tasks. A new study by the associate professor Cristina Cano and the full professor Xavier Vilajosana, researchers from the Wireless Networks (WiNe) group at the Internet Interdisciplinary Institute (IN3) and from the UOC's Faculty of Computer Science, Multimedia and Telecommunications, opens the door to the use of wireless technologies with power and reliability that are comparable to fibre optics and that could replace cabled connections. The research project, published in the journal IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, has created the first parameterization of a millimetre-band signal propagation model, a wireless technology capable of transmitting a huge amount of data per second, in an industrial environment. According to the researchers, this new model is the first step towards understanding how this type of signal behaves in an industrial plant and could have a significant impact on the development of Industry 4.0. Cristina Cano said: "This study is aimed at making communication less expensive and more flexible by incorporating mobile devices into the manufacturing process, something that could be very useful in moving towards Industry 4.0, since it allows, for example, connecting freely movable robotic arms to the production process or establishing communications for data reporting, and controlling or stopping the different components of the process in an emergency. But it could also allow the worker to be a part of the process.""</em> <a href="https://www.uoc.edu/portal/en/news/actualitat/2020/472-wifi-optical-fiber.html">[...]</a>

This method might in future make it possible to track experimentally the formation and decay of quantum Efimov systems. Anyone entering the world of quantum physics must prepare themself for quite a few things unknown in the everyday world: Noble gases form compounds, atoms behave like particles and waves at the same time and events that in the macroscopic world exclude each other occur simultaneously. In the world of quantum physics, Reinhard Dörner and his team are working with molecules which – in the sense of most textbooks – ought not to exist: Helium compounds with two atoms, known as helium dimers. Helium is called a noble gase precisely because it does not form any compounds."</em> <a href="https://aktuelles.uni-frankfurt.de/englisch/quantum-wave-in-helium-dimer-filmed-for-the-first-time/">[...]</a>

This innovation, which harnesses the massive parallelism of light, heralds a new era of optical signal processing for machine learning with numerous applications, including in self-driving cars, 5G networks, data-centers, biomedical diagnostics, data-security and more. THE SITUATION Global demand for machine learning hardware is dramatically outpacing current computing power supplies. State-of-the-art electronic hardware, such as graphics processing units and tensor processing unit accelerators, help mitigate this, but are intrinsically challenged by serial data processing that requires iterative data processing and encounters delays from wiring and circuit constraints. Optical alternatives to electronic hardware could help speed up machine learning processes by simplifying the way information is processed in a non-iterative way. However, photonic-based machine learning is typically limited by the number of components that can be placed on photonic integrated circuits, limiting the interconnectivity, while free-space spatial-light-modulators are restricted to slow programming speeds."</em> <a href="https://mediarelations.gwu.edu/developing-smarter-faster-machine-intelligence-light">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The bounds are some of the tightest yet on the existence of third-generation leptoquarks At the most fundamental level, matter is made up of two types of particles: leptons, such as the electron, and quarks, which combine to form protons, neutrons and other composite particles. Under the Standard Model of particle physics, both leptons and quarks fall into three generations of increasing mass. Otherwise, the two kinds of particles are distinct. But some theories that extend the Standard Model predict the existence of new particles called leptoquarks that would unify quarks and leptons by interacting with both. In a new paper, the CMS collaboration reports the results of its latest search for leptoquarks that would interact with third-generation quarks and leptons (the top and bottom quarks, the tau lepton and the tau neutrino). Such third-generation leptoquarks are a possible explanation for an array of tensions with the Standard Model (or “anomalies”), which have been seen in certain transformations of particles called B mesons but have yet to be confirmed."</em> <a href="https://home.cern/news/news/physics/cms-sets-new-bounds-mass-leptoquarks">[...]</a>

The work - alongside another study from University of Pennsylvania on the creation of such nano-porous membranes - holds promise for numerous application areas, from water and gas purification to monitoring of air quality and energy harvesting. In the early 20th century, renowned Danish physicist Martin Knudsen formulated theories to describe gas-flows. Emerging new systems of narrower pores challenged the Knudsen descriptions of gas-flows, but they remained valid and it was unknown at which point of diminishing scale they might fail. The Manchester team - led by Professor Radha Boya (pictured), in collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania team, led by Professor Marija Drndić - has shown for the first time that Knudsen’s description seems to hold true at the ultimate atomic limit.

<p><em>"Technique is 10,000 faster than previous methods, and can create active nanostructured gates directly below two-dimensional materials such as graphene It has long been a dream to invent new materials from the "top down" choosing which atoms go where to engineer properties of interest. A technique created by researchers out of the Department of Physics and Astronomy enables them to "sketch" patterns of electrons into a programmable quantum material--lanthanum aluminate/strontium titanate or "LAO/STO". Using this approach, they can create quantum devices and with feature sizes comparable to the spacing between electrons, and even "sketch" artificial lattices for electrons to traverse, with extremely high precision. To develop this capability, the researchers repurposed an electron beam lithography instrument, which is ordinarily used to create nanostructures by exposing a resist that hardens into a mask, enabling layers of material to be subsequently added or removed. Instead of operating the instrument at its usual value of 20,000 Volts, the researchers dialed it down to only a few hundred volts, where the electrons could not penetrate the surface of their oxide material, and instead--without any resist--catalyze a surface reaction that renders the LAO surface positively charged, and the LAO/STO interface locally conductive. The electron beam is 10,000 times faster at writing compared with atomic-force microscope-based lithography, without losing spatial resolution or ability to be reprogrammed."</em> <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-12/uop-rim121720.php">[...]</a>

Quantum dots, man-made nanocrystals 100,000 times thinner than a sheet of paper, can be used as light sensitisers, absorbing infrared and visible light and transferring it to other molecules. This could enable new types of solar panels to capture more of the light spectrum and generate more electrical current, through a process of ‘light fusion’ known as photochemical upconversion. The researchers, based at Monash University, used lead sulfide quantum dots in their example. The algorithm is free to access and their results have been published in the journal Nanoscale. Significantly, existing upconversion results achieved by test devices used organic sensitisers that do not work with silicon solar cells - currently the most commonly available type of photovoltaics technology - due to their inability to absorb much of the infrared part of the light spectrum."</em> <a href="https://excitonscience.com/news/goldilocks-and-three-quantum-dots-ones-just-right-peak-solar-panel-performance">[...]</a>

A pioneering technology created by UChicago scientists, however, allows researchers to peer into cells to see how many different organelles use voltages to carry out functions. “Scientists had noticed for a long time that charged dyes used for staining cells would get stuck in the mitochondria,” explained graduate student Anand Saminathan, the first author for the paper, which was published in Nature Nanotechnology. “But little work has been done to investigate the membrane potential of other organelles in live cells.” The Krishnan lab at UChicago specializes in building tiny sensors to travel inside cells and report back on what’s happening, so that researchers can understand how cells work—and how they break down in disease or disorders."</em> <a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/uchicago-scientists-pioneer-new-method-measuring-electricity-cells">[...]</a>

And, while there are other ways of doing that, by, for instance, using cameras and computer vision, this is a good solution that also maintains an individual’s privacy.” To create the hand gesture recognition system, the team collaborated with Ana Arias, a professor of electrical engineering at UC Berkeley, to design a flexible armband that can read the electrical signals at 64 different points on the forearm."</em> <a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/12/21/high-five-or-thumbs-up-new-device-detects-which-hand-gesture-you-want-to-make/">[...]</a>

An IR sensor is basically a device which consists of a pair of an IR LED and a photodiode which are collectively called a photo-coupler or an opto-coupler. The IR LED emits IR radiation. The IR radiation is emitted in a beam from the IR LED. When this beam is disturbed, it widens and "hits" the photodiode."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Easy-Infrared-Proximity-Sensor/">[...]</a>

In this tutorial, I want to share how to build a digital album that can display pictures in JPG format."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/luo-zeqing/make-a-digital-photo-album-by-esp32-72a672">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This Is An Project To Help View Us The Current Temperature And Humidity In Time. This is a Arduino Weather Station Project. I Decided To Make It Because This Project Can Helps Us All to View The current Temperature And Humidity In Time. In This Project, The Arduino Board Is Programmed In Such a Way That It Sends Commands To The DHT11 Sensor, Then The Sensor Sends The Temperature And Humidity Data To The Microcontroller. Finally The Arduino board Sends Another Set Of Commands To The LCD Display And Then The Display Prints The Current Temperature and humidity On Its Screen.
