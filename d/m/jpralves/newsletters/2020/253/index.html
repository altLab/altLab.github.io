<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1512, o cartógrafo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerardus_Mercator">Gerardus Mercator</a>. Ele ficou conhecido por ter criado um mapa, incorporando o que mais tarde foi conhecido como projecção de Mercator, no qual paralelos e meridianos são renderizados como linhas rectas espaçadas, de modo a produzir a qualquer momento uma proporção exacta de latitude para longitude. Ele também introduziu o termo atlas para uma colecção de mapas.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que  nascia, em 1574, o matemático inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Oughtred">William Oughtred</a>. Ele inventou a forma mais antiga da régua de cálculo, duas escalas logarítmicas lineares ou circulares idênticas mantidas juntas e ajustadas à mão. Melhorias envolvendo a regra interna familiar com a construção linear da lingueta na ranhura vieram mais tarde. Ele introduziu o familiar sinal de multiplicação x num livro de 1631, juntamente com o primeiro uso das abreviaturas sin, cos e tan.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1817, o físico francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Babinet">Jacques Babinet</a>. Ele foi o primeiro a propor a definição da unidade de comprimento em termos do comprimento de onda de uma linha espectral. A linha vermelha no espectro de cádmio foi escolhida e o angstrom foi redefinido como uma fracção desse valor. Ele estabeleceu um princípio na teoria da difracção (1837) que recebeu seu nome. O compensador Babinet foi sua invenção para medir a polarização da luz.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1842, o matemático alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Martin_Weber">Heinrich Martin Weber</a>. Ele estabeleceu uma base algébrica para superfícies de Riemann, permitindo uma formulação puramente algébrica do teorema de Riemann-Roch. Os trabalhos de pesquisa de Weber eram numerosos, a maioria deles publicados no Crelle's Journal ou no Mathematische Annalen.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1876, o engenheiro francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89douard_Belin">Édouard Belin</a>. Ele foi responsável pela invenção que  fez a primeira transmissão telefoto através de fios, de Paris a Lyon e Bordeaux e de volta a Paris. Ele desenvolveu ainda mais o Belinograph, capaz de fazer a primeira transmissão transatlântica de fax por rádio, em 4 de Agosto de 1921, entre Annapolis, Maryland, e os laboratórios de Belin em La Malmaison, França. A sua invenção digitalizou uma imagem num cilindro reflectindo um feixe de luz numa célula fotoeléctrica que convertia diferentes intensidades de luz reflectida em impulsos eléctricos. O seu equipamento foi adoptado na Grã-Bretanha em 1928 e usado quase exclusivamente pelos media europeus nas décadas de 30 a 40, quando o termo "Belino" passou a ser utilizado em geral para todos os tipos de transmissão de imagens.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1915, o matemático francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurent_Schwartz">Laurent Schwartz</a>. Ele foi pioneiro na teoria das distribuições, que atribui um significado bem definido a objectos como a função delta Dirac. Ele recebeu a Medalha Fields em 1950 pelo seu trabalho na teoria das distribuições.</p>

<p>Esta semana venho falar-vos de um número misterioso que é o 6174. À primeira vista, pode não parecer tão óbvio. Mas, como estamos prestes a ver, qualquer pessoa que possa subtrair pode descobrir o mistério que torna este número tão especial. Em 1949, o matemático D. R. Kaprekar de Devlali, na Índia, concebeu um processo agora conhecido como operação de Kaprekar. Primeiro, escolha um número de quatro dígitos em que os dígitos não sejam todos iguais (que não seja 1111, 2222, ...). Em seguida, reorganize os dígitos para obter os números maiores e menores que esses dígitos podem criar. Por fim, subtraia o menor número do maior para obter um novo número e continue repetindo a operação para cada novo número. É uma operação simples, mas Kaprekar descobriu que isso levou a um resultado surpreendente. Vamos experimentar, começando com o número 2020, os dígitos do ano passado. O número máximo que podemos criar com esses dígitos é 2200 e o mínimo é 0022 ou 22 (se um ou mais dígitos for zero, incorpore-os no lado esquerdo do número mínimo). O resultado é 2178. Agora 8721-1278=7443. Agora 7443-3447=3996. Agora 9963-3699=6264. Agora 6642-2466=4176. Agora 7641-1467=6174. Quando chegamos a 6174, a operação repete-se, dando sempre o resultado 6174 todas as vezes. Chamamos o número 6174 de um kernel desta operação. Então 6174 é um kernel para a operação do Kaprekar, mas isso é tão especial quanto o 6174? Bem, o 6174 não é apenas o único kernel para a operação, mas também tem mais uma surpresa na manga.</p>

<p>Também esta semana pudemos observar uma imagem de alta resolução captada pelo rover Curiosity sobre um panorama da superfície de Marte. Composta por mais de 1.000 imagens tiradas durante o feriado de Acção de Graças de 2019 e cuidadosamente reunidas nos meses seguintes, a composição contém 1,8 mil milhões de pixeis da paisagem marciana. A Mastcam do rover usou a sua lente telefoto para produzir o panorama; enquanto isso, contava com sua lente de ângulo médio para produzir um panorama de baixa resolução e quase 650 milhões de pixels, que inclui o deck do rover e o braço robótico.</p>

<p>Também esta semana cientistas que estudam um aglomerado de galáxias distantes descobriram a maior explosão vista no Universo desde o Big Bang. A explosão veio de um buraco negro supermassivo no centro de uma galáxia a centenas de milhões de anos-luz de distância. Ele libertou cinco vezes mais energia que o registado anteriormente.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7610">NASA's Curiosity Mars Rover Snaps Its Highest-Resolution Panorama Yet</a></h2>

<p><em>"NASA's Curiosity rover has captured its highest-resolution panorama yet of the Martian surface. Composed of more than 1,000 images taken during the 2019 Thanksgiving holiday and carefully assembled over the ensuing months, the composite contains 1.8 billion pixels of Martian landscape. The rover's Mast Camera, or Mastcam, used its telephoto lens to produce the panorama; meanwhile, it relied on its medium-angle lens to produce a lower-resolution, nearly 650-million-pixel panorama that includes the rover's deck and robotic arm. Both panoramas showcase "Glen Torridon," a region on the side of Mount Sharp that Curiosity is exploring. They were taken between Nov. 24 and Dec. 1, when the mission team was out for the Thanksgiving holiday. Sitting still with few tasks to do while awaiting the team to return and provide its next commands, the rover had a rare chance to image its surroundings from the same vantage point several days in a row."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7610">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.icrar.org/kaboom/">Astronomers Detect Biggest Explosion In The History Of The Universe</a></h2>

<p><em>"Scientists studying a distant galaxy cluster have discovered the biggest explosion seen in the Universe since the Big Bang. The blast came from a supermassive black hole at the centre of a galaxy hundreds of millions of light-years away. It released five times more energy than the previous record holder. Professor Melanie Johnston-Hollitt, from the Curtin University node of the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research, said the event was extraordinarily energetic. “We’ve seen outbursts in the centres of galaxies before but this one is really, really massive,” she said. “And we don’t know why it’s so big."</em> <a href="https://www.icrar.org/kaboom/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The Goodyear reCharge is a revolutionary self-regenerating concept tire that can adapt and change to meet individual mobility needs. “Goodyear wants the tire to be an even more powerful contributor to answering consumers’ specific mobility needs, said Mike Rytokoski, Vice-President and Chief Marketing Officer, Goodyear Europe, “It was with that ambition that we set out to create a concept tire primed for the future of personalized and convenient electric mobility.” The reCharge concept includes a number of innovative features that are built around three pillars: Personalized At the core of the reCharge concept is a reloadable and biodegradable tread compound that can be recharged with individual capsules, radically simplifying the process of replacing your tires. Filled with a customized liquid compound, these capsules allow the tread to regenerate and the tire to adapt over time to climatic circumstances, road conditions, or simply how you want to travel. Thanks to artificial intelligence a driver profile would be created around which the liquid compound would be customized, generating a compound blend tailored to each individual. Sustainable The compound itself would be made from a biological material and would be reinforced with fibres inspired by one of the toughest natural materials in the world - spider silk. This would make it both extremely durable and 100 percent biodegradable."</em> <a href="https://news.goodyear.eu/the-goodyear-recharge-concept--making-tire-changing-easy-with-customized-capsules-that-renew-your-tires/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Two programmer-musicians wrote every possible MIDI melody in existence to a hard drive, copyrighted the whole thing, and then released it all to the public in an attempt to stop musicians from getting sued. Programmer, musician, and copyright attorney Damien Riehl, along with fellow musician/programmer Noah Rubin, sought to stop copyright lawsuits that they believe stifle the creative freedom of artists. Often in copyright cases for song melodies, if the artist being sued for infringement could have possibly had access to the music they're accused of copying—even if it was something they listened to once—they can be accused of "subconsciously" infringing on the original content. One of the most notorious examples of this is Tom Petty's claim that Sam Smith's “Stay With Me” sounded too close to Petty's “I Won’t Back Down." Smith eventually had to give Petty co-writing credits on their own chart-topping song, which entitled Petty to royalties. Defending a case like that in court can cost millions of dollars in legal fees, and the outcome is never assured."</em> <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wxepzw/musicians-algorithmically-generate-every-possible-melody-release-them-to-public-domain">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Computer model of face processing could reveal how the brain produces richly detailed visual representations so quickly. When we open our eyes, we immediately see our surroundings in great detail. How the brain is able to form these richly detailed representations of the world so quickly is one of the biggest unsolved puzzles in the study of vision. Scientists who study the brain have tried to replicate this phenomenon using computer models of vision, but so far, leading models only perform much simpler tasks such as picking out an object or a face against a cluttered background. Now, a team led by MIT cognitive scientists has produced a computer model that captures the human visual system’s ability to quickly generate a detailed scene description from an image, and offers some insight into how the brain achieves this. “What we were trying to do in this work is to explain how perception can be so much richer than just attaching semantic labels on parts of an image, and to explore the question of how do we see all of the physical world,” says Josh Tenenbaum, a professor of computational cognitive science and a member of MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and the Center for Brains, Minds, and Machines (CBMM)."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2020/computer-model-brain-vision-0304">[...]</a>

<p><em>"One of the fundamental mysteries of chemistry has been solved by Australian scientists - and the result may have implications for future designs of solar cells, organic light-emitting diodes and other next gen technologies. Ever since the 1930s debate has raged inside chemistry circles concerning the fundamental structure of benzene. It is a debate that in recent years has taken on added urgency, because benzene - which comprises six carbon atoms matched with six hydrogen atoms - is the smallest molecule that can be used in the production of opto-electronic materials, which are revolutionising renewable energy and telecommunications tech. It is also a component of DNA, proteins, wood and petroleum. The controversy around the structure of the molecule arises because although it has few atomic components it exists in a state comprising not just four dimensions - like our everyday "big" world - but 126. Measuring a system that complex - and tiny - has until now proved impossible, meaning that the precise behaviour of benzene electrons could not be discovered."</em> <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-03/uons-sam030420.php">[...]</a>

This type of “non-demolition” measurement is important for creating quantum computers that are fault tolerant. Quantum computers promise to make it easier to perform certain classes of calculations such as many-body problems, which are extremely difficult and time-consuming for conventional computers. Essentially, the involve measuring a quantum value which is never in a single state like a conventional transistor, but instead exists as a “superimposed state”—in the same way that Schrodinger’s famous cat cannot be said to be alive or dead until it is observed. Using such systems, it is possible to conduct calculations with a qubit that is a superimposition of two values, and then determine statistically what the correct result is. Quantum computers that use single electron spins in silicon QDs are seen as attractive due to their potential scalability and because silicon is already widely used in electronics technology."</em> <a href="https://www.riken.jp/en/news_pubs/research_news/pr/2020/20200303_2/index.html">[...]</a>

The multitasking device could make possible new physics experiments, such as research in the pursuit of an electric circuit for faster, next-generation electronics like quantum computing technologies. “So far, materials simultaneously showing superconducting, insulating, and magnetic properties have been very rare."</em> <a href="https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2020/03/04/2d-material-gets-a-new-gig/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A new type of concrete that is made out of waste materials and can bend under load has been developed and patented by Swinburne researchers Dr Behzad Nematollahi and Professor Jay Sanjayan. This material incorporates industrial waste products such as fly ash – a by-product of coal-fired power stations. It is especially suited for construction in earthquake zones where the brittle nature of conventional concrete often leads to disastrous building collapses. “Concrete is the most widely used construction material in the world,” says ARC DECRA Fellow at Swinburne's Centre for Smart Infrastructure and Digital Construction, Dr Nematollahi. “In fact, it is the second-most consumed material by human beings after water. Its quality has a massive effect on the resilience of our infrastructure such as buildings, bridges and tunnels.” Traditional concrete is not only prone to shatter when being stretched or bent, but also has a huge carbon footprint due to calcination of limestone to produce its key ingredient, cement."</em> <a href="https://www.swinburne.edu.au/news/latest-news/2020/03/bendable-safe-long-lasting-and-green-cement-free-concrete-developed-at-swinburne.php">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers from U of T Engineering and King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) have overcome a key obstacle in combining the emerging solar-harvesting technology of perovskites with the commercial gold standard — silicon solar cells. The result is a highly efficient and stable tandem solar cell, one of the best-performing reported to date. “Today, silicon solar cells are more efficient and less costly than ever before,” says Professor Ted Sargent (ECE), senior author on a new paper published today in Science. “But there are limits to how efficient silicon can be on its own. We’re focused on overcoming these limits using a tandem (two-layer) approach.” Like silicon, perovskite crystals can absorb solar energy to excite electrons that can be channeled into a circuit. But unlike silicon, perovskites can be mixed with liquid to create a ‘solar ink’ that can be printed on surfaces."</em> <a href="https://news.engineering.utoronto.ca/enhanced-tandem-solar-cells-set-new-standard-in-converting-light-into-electricity/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers from the Institute for Quantum Computing (IQC) at the University of Waterloo report the first occurrence of directly splitting one photon into three. The occurrence, the first of its kind, used the spontaneous parametric down-conversion method (SPDC) in quantum optics and created what quantum optics researchers call a non-Gaussian state of light. A non-Gaussian state of light is considered a critical ingredient to gain a quantum advantage. “It was understood that there were limits to the type of entanglement generated with the two-photon version, but these results form the basis of an exciting new paradigm of three-photon quantum optics,” said Chris Wilson, a principal investigator at IQC faculty member and a professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Waterloo. “Given that this research brings us past the known ability to split one photon into two entangled daughter photons, we’re optimistic that we’ve opened up a new area of exploration.” “The two-photon version has been a workhorse for quantum research for over 30 years,” said Wilson. “We think three photons will overcome the limits and will encourage further theoretical research and experimental applications and hopefully the development of optical quantum computing using superconducting units.” Wilson used microwave photons to stretch the known limits of SPDC."</em> <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/news/news/quantum-researchers-able-split-one-photon-three">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers shine a light on ways to keep the energy flowing With the goal of eliminating brownouts and blackouts, new research from UBC’s Okanagan School of Engineering is redesigning how electricity is distributed within power grids. The research describes a power system operation that will consist of multiple microgrids—separate grids operating like individual islands that can disconnect from the main power supply and run independently. These islanded systems will provide electricity to smaller geographical areas, such as cities and large neighbourhoods. In the case of a failure in the main system, the local grid operation system will keep the lights on. “The microgrid will recognize the problem in the main power system and will isolate itself, avoiding previously inevitable power outages,” explains Yuri Rodrigues, a UBCO electrical engineering doctoral student and study co-author. He explains, however, that a continued supply of power in this mode will depend on locally available generating reserves."</em> <a href="https://news.ok.ubc.ca/2020/02/28/say-goodbye-to-power-outages-says-ubc-okanagan-engineer/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"After the nice reception my last article on NTP got, I decided that it was about time I pulled a project off the shelf from a few years ago and get a stratum 1 NTP server running on a Raspberry Pi again. So this article is going to be my notes on how I built one using a cheap GPS module off eBay as the reference time source and a Raspberry Pi. (a 2B in this case, but hopefully the differences for newer models will be minor; if there are any, they're probably around the behavior of the serial port since I think things changed on the Pi3 with bluetooth support?) So anyways, before we jump into it, let's spend some time talking about why you would and wouldn't want to do this: Pro: NTP is awesome, and this lets you get a stratum 1 time server on your local network for much lower cost that traditional COTS NTP time standards, which tend to be in the thousands of dollars price range. Con: This is a Raspberry Pi, booting off an SD card, with a loose PCB plugged into the top of it, so I wouldn't classify it as "a robust appliance". It isn't a packaged enterprise grade product, so I wouldn't rely on this NTP server on its own for anything too critical, but then again, I would say that about NTP in general; it's only meant to get clocks to within "pretty close" of real time."</em> <a href="https://blog.thelifeofkenneth.com/2020/03/building-raspberry-pi-stratum-1-ntp.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The Cassette Pi is a self-contained real-time notification scroller, all housed neatly inside a transparent cassette tape. A Raspberry Pi Zero is sandwiched between the two tape reels, retrieving all manner of Internet of Things notifications from the fabulous IFTTT (If This, Then That) service, delivered almost instantly to the Pi via an Adafruit.IO feed and a Python script. The whole cassette vibrates to alert you to the incoming notification, and the text is then scrolled clearly across a Pimoroni 11x7 LED display. Everything is powered by a 150mAh LiPo battery, connected to the Pi via a LiPo Shim - also within the cassette is an Adafruit Micro Lipo so when the battery runs low it can be plugged directly into a Micro USB power source to grab some juice. The most fun part is that thanks to some trimming of the Pi itself, the cassette can still fit inside any vintage tape player, turning that old ornament into a functional and classy Internet of Things device. The Cassette Pi is perfect for use as a conference badge too, dangling from a lanyard and scrolling your name or a custom message."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Cassette-Pi-IoT-Scroller/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"I love to work on lighting projects, and having done my fair share of NeoPixel/WS2812b-based installations, I can tell you from experience that sometimes it can be really tricky nailing down a fully comprehensive design that "just works" when it's deployed. One of the things that I see most often overlooked when integrating pixels of any chipset into staging, decor or other applications is the attention needed to properly route the required data and power wiring to where it's needed. Batteries and Bluetooth don't cut it for large scale installations, and conversely, the wiring needed to support multiple pixel groups can quickly become cumbersome and expensive when you consider the high power requirements of lighting. With this in mind, we can appreciate the PixPoE project from Glen Akins, a professionally designed hardware project aimed at simplifying the installation of pixel-based lighting projects! Networked pixel controllers are a popular project, but I'm going to take a look at what really makes the PixPoE such an interesting design for me It's integrated PoE power supply, something I've often been found wishing for!

They are comprised of several large squares that help to align and position the edges of the QR code, formatting columns, a version number, and finally, the data itself. The data they contain can encode a variety of types, including numbers, characters, and binary, which can allow for many creative uses. Advertisers often encode URLs in them that redirect the user to their website. Other companies might place important product information in a QR code, such as a serial number, and attach it to a component."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/gatoninja236/scan-qr-codes-in-real-time-with-raspberry-pi-a5268b">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Introduction I’ve recently become interested in clock projects, and it seemed appropriate to start by building the essential digital clock assembled from logic chips. Although clock projects exactly like this have been around for the best part of 50 years at this point, I wanted to work it all out for myself, so I had a good read through Don Lancaster’s CMOS Cookbook for inspiration. Hardware The timebase is a typical 32.768kHz watch crystal, divided down to 1Hz using a 4060 counter into a 4013 flip-flop. It’s not the most accurate timebase, but it’s good enough. I thought about going the other route and deriving the timebase from the mains line frequency, but decided against it as I would like to be able to run the clock from a DC power source should I ever want to, rather than being tied to using an AC transformer (on a 50Hz supply as well). This 1Hz clock signal goes into a chain of 4029 counters, to count the seconds, minutes and hours; each counting the 1s and 10s separately."</em> <a href="https://hkadesign.org.uk/cmosclock.html">[...]</a>

The problem is that when he's off the leash sometimes he gets too excited and runs further than he should and with the low light and the other dogs it's not easy to spot him right away. To solve this I had the idea of making a dog harness that will glow red when he goes to far from me, as an added requirement I wanted to make it without using any microcontroller or programming to make it as accessible as posible for other makers.
