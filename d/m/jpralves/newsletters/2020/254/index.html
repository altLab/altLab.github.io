<p>Faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1790 o quimico inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Frederic_Daniell">John Frederic Daniell</a>. Ele foi responsável pela invenção da célula Daniell, que foi uma grande melhoria em relação à célula voltaica usada nos primeiros dias do desenvolvimento da bateria. A sua pesquisa em 1820 levou à invenção de um higrómetro que media a humidade relativa que posteriormente se tornou um instrumento padrão. Daniell iniciou experiências em 1835, na tentativa de melhorar a bateria voltaica com seu problema de ser instável e como uma fonte fraca de corrente eléctrica. Em 1836, ele inventou uma célula primária na qual o hidrogénio foi eliminado com a geração da electricidade. Daniell tinha resolvido o problema da polarização devido a uma fina película de bolhas de hidrogénio que se formava sobre o eléctrodo positivo que reduzia a corrente.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1824, o físico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Kirchhoff">Gustav Kirchhoff</a>. Ele juntamente com Robert Bunsen, estabeleceu a teoria da análise de espectro (uma técnica para análise química, analisando a luz emitida por um material aquecido), aplicada por Kirchhoff para determinar a composição do Sol. Ele descobriu que quando a luz passa através de um gás, o gás absorve os comprimentos de onda que seriam emitidos se aquecidos, o que explicava as numerosas linhas escuras (linhas de Fraunhofer) no espectro do Sol. Nas leis de Kirchhoff (1845), ele generalizou as equações que descrevem o fluxo de corrente no caso dos condutores eléctricos em três dimensões, estendendo a lei de Ohm ao cálculo das correntes, tensões e resistências das redes eléctricas. Ele demonstrou que a corrente flui num condutor de resistência zero à velocidade da luz.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1838, o químico inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Henry_Perkin">William Henry Perkin</a>. Enquanto experimentava sintetizar o quinino a partir de um produto químico do alcatrão de carvão, Perkins misturou anilina e dicromato de sódio e inesperadamente encontrou uma cor densa - que ele denominou roxo anilina - que extraiu com álcool. Ele descobrira o primeiro corante artificial. Os têxteis da sua época eram coloridos de fontes naturais; a dele era uma alternativa valiosa. Aos 18 anos, ele patenteou o corante. O seu pai investiu em seus esforços para fabricar o corante. Foi colocado à venda em 1857 e tornou-se popular na França. Aos 23 anos, ele era pai de uma nova indústria química orgânica sintética.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1905, o engenheiro electrotécnico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chauncey_Guy_Suits">Chauncey Guy Suits</a>. Ele ajudou a desenvolver um novo processo, anunciado em 1962, para criar diamantes sintéticos comprimindo carbono numa grande prensa hidráulica a pressões de até três milhões de libras por polegada quadrada, enquanto simultaneamente aquecido a 9.000 ºF, sem a necessidade do agente catalisador de metal usado anteriormente. Ele possuía 77 patentes nos EUA, em aplicações variadas, como melhorias de sinal de bloqueio ferroviário, circuitos para sinais eléctricos que piscam em sequência, circuitos de rádio, sinalizadores, sinais submarinos, redutores de luz de teatro e relés fotoeléctricos.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1925, o físico japonês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Esaki">Leo Esaki</a>. Ele partilhou (com Ivar Giaever e Brian Josephson) o Prémio Nobel de Física (1973) em reconhecimento pelo seu trabalho pioneiro em tunelamento de electrões em sólidos. A partir de algumas experiências aparentemente simples publicadas em 1958, ele foi capaz de desvendar os processos de tunelamento em sólidos, um fenómeno que estava coberto de perguntas por décadas. O tunelamento é um efeito mecânico quântico no qual um electrão passa através de uma barreira em potencial, embora a teoria clássica previsse que não poderia. A descoberta do Dr. Esaki levou à criação do díodo Esaki, um componente importante da física do estado sólido com aplicações práticas em circuitos de alta velocidade encontrados em computadores e redes de comunicações.</p>

<p>E nesta semana que passou o tema dominante foi o COVID-19, nome dado a doença provocada por uma estirpe de coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) descoberta em final de 2019 e que teve origem em Wuhan na China.
Até agora tinha sido uma doença que afectava o mundo mas à qual Portugal tinha ficado de fora não sofrendo (de forma muito visível) os efeitos que outros países já estavam a sofrer. Mas esta semana deixou de ser uma doença que afecta os outros e passou a afectar o nosso quotidiano. Tendo passado à categoria de pandemia significa que todos os países estão em risco. E é particularmente importante que cada um de nós contribua activamente para o controlo desta doença seguindo os conselhos da OMS evitando locais com densidade elevada de pessoas, deslocações desnecessárias, lavar as mãos com frequência, evitar cumprimentos próximos como apertos de mão ou beijinhos, evitar tocar com as mãos nos seus olhos, boca ou nariz, e usar o bom senso nas compras de bens evitando o desperdício.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker.</p>

<p><em>"The 3D-printed thrust chamber assembly of the methane-fuelled M10 rocket engine has passed its first series of hot firing tests. The M10 engine will power the upper stage of future Vega evolutions from 2025. “These test results are encouraging, confirming that our propulsion teams are right on track along the development path identified for such novel technology for Vega evolutions,” commented Giorgio Tumino, managing ESA’s Vega and Space Rider development programmes. M10 will improve propulsion efficiency and environmental sustainability by reducing emissions and combustion waste thereby increasing the competitiveness of European small launchers and lowering their cost. The M10 is restartable and uses a system of smart pressure control. This improves fuel management and offers mission flexibility."</em> <a href="https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Transportation/3D-printed_thrust_chamber_passes_first_tests_for_Vega_evolutions">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Microchip’s new cryptographic MCU, custom firmware and provisioning service are designed to enable platforms to detect and stop malicious firmware prior to run time With the rapid growth of 5G including new cellular infrastructure, growing networks and data centers supporting expanding cloud computing, developers are seeking new ways to ensure operating systems remain secure and uncompromised. Microchip Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP) today announced a new cryptography-enabled microcontroller (MCU), the CEC1712 MCU with Soteria-G2 custom firmware – designed to stop malicious malware such as rootkit and bootkit for systems that boot from external Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) flash memory. Microchip’s Soteria-G2 custom firmware on its full-featured CEC1712 Arm® Cortex®-M4-based microcontroller provides secure boot with hardware root of trust protection in a pre-boot mode for those operating systems booting from external SPI flash memory. In addition, the CEC1712 provides key revocation and code rollback protection during operating life enabling in-field security updates. Complying with NIST 800-193 guidelines, the CEC1712 protects, detects and recovers from corruption for total system platform firmware resiliency. The secure boot with hardware root of trust is critical in protecting the system against threats before they can load into the system and only allows the system to boot using software trusted by the manufacturer."</em> <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en/pressreleasepage/protect-against-rootkit-and-bootkit-malware-in-systems-that-boot-from-external-spi-flash-memory">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Samsung Electronics, a world leader in advanced digital component solutions, today unveiled its first “human-centric” LED packages, collectively known as LM302N. Engineered with carefully created light spectra, the LM302N family helps human bodies adjust melatonin levels indoors, making people feel more energetic or relaxed depending on their daily life patterns. “The benefits of using Samsung’s LM302N reach beyond the basic lighting function of visual recognition, by improving the non-visual biological effects of lighting on people,” said Un Soo Kim, senior vice president of LED Business Team at Samsung Electronics. “Our LED solutions are ushering in a whole new human-oriented approach of using artificial lighting to enhance productivity and relaxation, benefitting modern-day indoor lifestyles.” Melatonin, a hormone which regulates the sleep-wake cycle, responds to the cyan wavelength range of light. Brighter cyan-concentrated lighting suppresses the body’s production of melatonin, increasing concentration and enabling a greater overall sense of alertness. Similarly, a lower cyan light intensity minimizes disturbances to the natural onset of the body’s melatonin production, helping to promote sleep quality."</em> <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-unveils-its-first-family-of-human-centric-led-components-to-enhance-indoor-lifestyles">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.helmholtz-berlin.de/pubbin/news_seite?nid=21128;sprache=en">Fast and furious: New class of 2D materials stores electrical energy</a></h2>

<p><em>"Two dimensional titanium carbides, so-called MXenes, are being discussed as candidates for the rapid storage of electrical energy. Like a battery,MXenes can store large amounts of electrical energy through electrochemical reactions- but unlike batteries,can be charged and discharged in a matter of seconds. In collaboration with Drexel University, a team at HZB showed that the intercalation of urea molecules between the MXene layers can increase the capacity of such "pseudo-capacitors" by more than 50 percent. At BESSY II they have analysed how changes of the MXene surface chemistry after urea intercalation are responsible for this. There are different solutions for storing electrical energy: Lithium-based electrochemical batteries, for example, store large amounts of energy, but require long charging times. Supercapacitors, on the other hand, are able to absorb or release electrical energy extremely quickly - but store much less electrical energy."</em> <a href="https://www.helmholtz-berlin.de/pubbin/news_seite?nid=21128;sprache=en">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scientists have made a breakthrough in the search for a new, sustainable permanent magnet. Most permanent magnets are made from alloys of rare earth metals - but the mining and processing of these materials produces toxic by-products, leading to ecological challenges around rare-earth mines and refineries. At the same time, demand for permanent magnets is increasing as they are a common component in renewable energy, consumer electronics and electric-powered vehicles. A team of scientists, led by the University of Leeds, has made a breakthrough in a new advanced material which may eventually replace rare-earth-based permanent magnets. The researchers have developed a hybrid film from a thin layer of cobalt, which is naturally magnetic, covered with molecules of Buckminsterfullerene, a form of carbon. The presence of the carbon dramatically boosted cobalt’s magnetic energy product, a measure of the strength of a magnet, by five times at low temperatures."</em> <a href="https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/physics/news/article/5624/breakthrough-magnet-produced-from-sustainable-materials">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) have reported the world's first 1.5 μm III-V lasers directly grown on the industry-standard 220 nm SOI (silicon-on-insulators) wafers without buffer, potentially paving an opening to the "holy grail" for present silicon (Si-) photonics research. Seamlessly bridging the active III-V light sources with the passive Si-based photonic devices, the demonstration could be deployed as light sources in integrated circuits to greatly improve circuit speed, power efficiency and cost-effectiveness. In other conventional approaches of integrating III-V lasers on Si in the literature, thick III-V buffers up to a few micrometers are used to reduce the defect densities, which posts huge challenges for efficient light interfacing between the epitaxial III-V lasers and the Si-based waveguides. For the first time in history, the research team led by Prof. LAU Kei-May of HKUST's Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering and Post-doctoral Fellow Dr. HAN Yu devised a novel growth scheme to eliminate the requirement of thick III-V buffers and thus promoted efficient light coupling into the Si-waveguides. The bufferless feature points to a fully integrated Si-based photonic integrated circuits. That has enabled the first demonstration of 1.5 μm III-V lasers directly grown on the industry-standard 220 nm SOI wafers using metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD)."</em> <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-03/hkuo-fb1030420.php">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A world premiere in Austria: The new bridge construction technology which was developed at TU Wien has now been successfully applied by ASFINAG during the construction of the Fürstenfeld Motorway There are many different methods for erecting bridges – but the new technique developed by TU Wien, the balanced lowering method, is quite spectacular: the bridge is not built horizontally, as would normally be case, but erected in a vertical position and then rotated into the horizontal position. The first large scale tests were carried out in 2010, since then the method has been refined and tuned until finally finding its first application by the ASFINAG for two bridges of the Fürstenfeld Motorway S7. With the erection process successfully completed for the Lahnbach Bridge, the 116 m long bridge over the Lafnitz was “unfolded” on the 27th of February 2020. With no scaffolding needed this new bridge construction method not only saves time but also money and resources. The umbrella principle “Depending on the size and location a variety of bridge building techniques are applied nowadays,” Prof. Johann Kollegger of the Institute of Structural Engineering of TU Wien explains. If the bridge is not too high from the ground it can be erected using scaffolding."</em> <a href="https://www.tuwien.at/en/tu-wien/news/news-articles/news/the-unfoldable-bridge/">[...]</a>

Such “movies” could eventually help scientists design more efficient chemical processes, invent next-generation materials with new properties, develop drugs to fight disease and more. The new technique takes advantage of a form of light called terahertz radiation, instead of the usual radio-frequency radiation, to manipulate the beams of electrons the instrument uses. This lets researchers control how fast the camera takes snapshots and, at the same time, reduces a pesky effect called timing jitter, which prevents researchers from accurately recording the timeline of how atoms or molecules change.

To make the work a challenge, I wanted to only use an Arduino Nano clocked at 16 Mhz and some passive components (diodes are OK) and create the best possible video and audio signal that is imaginable with such restrictions. As it turned out, a monochrome 288p video signal with 4 gray scales is possible when progamming the controller at machine level. 4-channel music is also possible. My game of choice is Tetris in a version that comes pretty close to the original GameBoy version with a very similar audio track.

<p><em>"LM317 Current Boosting Secrets! LM317 is one of the most popular adjustable regulator chips. The output voltage of the regulator can be adjusted from 1.25V to 35V. However, the chip can deliver currents up to 1.5A which is not enough for some power applications. In this article, I will discuss two methods of LM317 current boosting, using power PNP and NPN pass transistors. [A] Circuit Analysis According to the LM317 datasheet: “The LM317 [1, 2] device is an adjustable three-terminal positive-voltage regulator capable of supplying more than 1.5 A over an output-voltage range of 1.25 V to 37 V. It requires only two external resistors to set the output voltage."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/hesam-moshiri/lm317-current-boosting-secrets-134d03">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Ever since the 80's I've wanted to build a Z80 computer. I even bought the chips, but never used them. The reasons for this are varied. I never liked erasing and reprogramming EPROMs. My EPROM eraser died. I didn't have the money to make a PCB, or the software (or red and blue tape and a lightbox)."</em> <a href="https://trochilidae.blogspot.com/2019/12/z80-arduino-using-mega-as-debugger-ever.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"What is ulab ulab (pronounced "micro lab") lets you perform number crunching tasks in CircuitPython more quickly, often around 10x as fast. This can be very handy when dealing with sensor data, as we'll see below. Right now, you need to get the "absolute newest" version of CircuitPython to have ulab enabled. It'll be in the stable version no sooner than when 5.1.0 is released. ulab is modeled after numpy, but is not entirely compatible; so after the examples, we'll also provide you with some guidelines to help you move between numpy and ulab. ulab is not available in Blinka, Adafruit's Single Board Computer layer for CircuitPython - for those boards we recommend using plain numpy since its available!"</em> <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/ulab-crunch-numbers-fast-with-circuitpython?view=all">[...]</a>

However, this tends to be very difficult to remember through the course of the day. In fact, trying to avoid touching our faces often serves only to remind us just how frequently we do touch them. Sentinel was designed to provide a subtle reminder not to touch your face.
