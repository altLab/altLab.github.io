<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1854, químico orgânico francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Sabatier_(chemist)">Paul Sabatier</a>. Ele partilhou o Prémio Nobel de Química em 1912 com Victor Grignard.Sabatier pelas suas pesquisas em síntese orgânica catalítica, e descobertas do uso de níquel finamente dividido como catalisador na hidrogenação (a adição de hidrogénio a moléculas de compostos de carbono). As indústrias de margarina, hidrogenação a óleo e metanol sintético cresceram a partir deste trabalho. Ele descobriu que aumentar a área de superfície de catalisadores como cobre e níquel dividindo-os de forma muito fina aumenta muito sua eficácia. Sabatier fez uma ampla pesquisa sobre o uso de catalisadores em sintetizadores de química orgânica, revelando que metais que não sejam níquel, embora menos eficazes, também podem se comportar como catalisadores.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1893, o inventor e engenheiro americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Loewy">Raymond Loewy</a>. Nascido na França, ele ficou conhecido como o "Pai da Simplificação". Exemplos famosos dos seus projectos incluem o Studebaker1947 Starlight Coupe, o Starliner Coupe de 1953 e o Avanti 1961 - desenhos que geraram um interesse público e aceitação muito fora de proporção ao tamanho relativo da empresa na indústria; a linha de 1947 dos receptores de rádio Hallicrafter que transmitiam uma precisão nítida muito à frente de seu tempo; a máquina de duplicação Gestetner de 1929, a Geladeira Sears Coldspot de 1934 e a locomotiva a vapor S-1 para a Estrada de Ferro da Pensilvânia - todos os projectos de referência influentes no estabelecimento de padrões de design mais elevados nas suas respectivas áreas de design. Ele também projectou itens menores como escovas de dentes, lâminas de barbear, móveis e a Garrafa de Coca-Cola.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1927, o estatístico japonês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirotugu_Akaike">Hirotugu Akaike</a>. Ele formulou o critério de informação de Akaike (AIC). A AIC é hoje amplamente utilizada para a selecção de modelos, que é comummente o aspecto mais difícil da inferência estatística; além disso, a AIC é a base de um paradigma para os fundamentos das estatísticas. Akaike também fez grandes contribuições para o estudo de séries temporais. Além disso, ele teve um grande papel no desenvolvimento geral das estatísticas no Japão.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1948, o físico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Daniel_Phillips">William D. Phillips</a>. As suas experiências com luz laser para arrefecer e prender átomos fez que com que fosse atribuída uma parte do Prémio Nobel de Física em 1997 (com Steven Chu e Claude Cohen-Tannoudji). Eles desenvolveram métodos para usar luz laser para arrefecer gases à faixa de temperatura microkelvin perto do zero absoluto, e mantendo os átomos refrigerados flutuando ou capturados em diferentes tipos de "armadilhas atómicas". A luz laser funciona como um líquido espesso, apelidado de melaço óptico, no qual os átomos são desacelerados. Átomos individuais podem ser assim estudados com uma precisão muito grande e a sua estrutura interna pode ser determinada. À medida que mais e mais átomos são capturados no mesmo volume, forma-se um gás fino, e as suas propriedades podem ser estudadas em detalhes.</p>

<p>Faz hoje 13 anos que era criado o sistema Android. A Google, depois de alguma especulação, e após ter comprado uma pequena startup chamada "Android", entra no mercado dos smartphones. Depois de rumores indicando o contrário a Google anunciou que o Android seria uma plataforma aberta para todos através da "Open Handset Alliance". A Google prometeu que o Android mudaria o status quo, e definitivamente cumpriu, tendo actualmente mais de 72% do mercado mundial de smartphones, de acordo com algumas estimativas recentes (se não mais).</p>

<p>E nesta semana que passou a fundação Raspberry Pi fez mais um anuncio estrondoso. Um teclado com um Raspberry Pi no seu interior por 70 USD. Inspirado nos computadores domésticos da década de 1980, a missão da fundação Raspberry Pi é colocar computadores programáveis de alto desempenho e acessíveis nas mãos de pessoas em todo o mundo. E inspirado por esses PCs clássicos, aqui está o Raspberry Pi 400: um computador pessoal completo, integrado num teclado compacto. Usando o mesmo footprint dos teclados anteriormente lançados, foi desenhada uma placa Raspberry Pi que se ajustasse perfeitamente a ser colocada dentro deste teclado. O resultado é um Raspberry PI 4 em formato de "teclado" com uma velocidade de relógio de processador de 1.8Ghz, com arrefecimento passivo e 4GB de memória. Tem 3 Portas USB (2 USB3), a porta Gigabit Ethernet, duas portas micro-HDMI, uma slot para o microSD e os 40 pinos. Usa um interface USB-C para ser ligado à corrente.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos assim como projetos de maker. É apresentado o livro "Raspberry Pi Beginner's Guide 4th Edition" que entre outras coisas aborda o novo Raspberry Pi 400.</p>

<p><em>"Raspberry Pi has always been a PC company. Inspired by the home computers of the 1980s, our mission is to put affordable, high-performance, programmable computers into the hands of people all over the world. And inspired by these classic PCs, here is Raspberry Pi 400: a complete personal computer, built into a compact keyboard. Raspberry Pi 4, which we launched in June last year, is roughly forty times as powerful as the original Raspberry Pi, and offers an experience that is indistinguishable from a legacy PC for the majority of users. Particularly since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve seen a rapid increase in the use of Raspberry Pi 4 for home working and studying. But user friendliness is about more than performance: it can also be about form factor."</em> <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-400-the-70-desktop-pc/">[...]</a>

On Oct. 29, mission operators sent a series of commands to NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft for the first time since mid-March. The spacecraft has been flying solo while the 70-meter-wide (230-foot-wide) radio antenna used to talk to it has been offline for repairs and upgrades. Voyager 2 returned a signal confirming it had received the "call" and executed the commands without issue. The call to Voyager 2 was a test of new hardware recently installed on Deep Space Station 43, the only dish in the world that can send commands to Voyager 2. Located in Canberra, Australia, it is part of NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN), a collection of radio antennas around the world used primarily to communicate with spacecraft operating beyond the Moon."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/nasa-contacts-voyager-2-using-upgraded-deep-space-network-dish">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The BASE collaboration is developing a transportable antiproton trap to make higher-precision measurements of the properties of antimatter The BASE collaboration at CERN has bagged more than one first in antimatter research. For example, it made the first ever more precise measurement for antimatter than for matter, it kept antimatter stored for a record time of more than a year, and it conducted the first laboratory-based search for an interaction between antimatter and a candidate particle for dark matter called the axion. Now, the BASE team is developing a device that could take antimatter research to new heights – a transportable antiproton trap to carry antimatter produced at CERN’s Antimatter Decelerator (AD) to another facility at CERN or elsewhere, for higher-precision antimatter measurements. These measurements could uncover differences between matter and antimatter. The Big Bang should have created equal amounts of matter and antimatter, yet the present-day universe is made almost entirely of matter, so something must have happened to create the imbalance. The Standard Model of particle physics predicts a certain difference between matter and antimatter, but this difference is insufficient to explain the imbalance, prompting researchers to look for other, as-yet-unseen differences between the two forms of matter."</em> <a href="https://home.cern/news/news/physics/transportable-antiproton-trap-unlock-secrets-antimatter">[...]</a>

<p><em>"X-ray scattering yields new information on "charge density waves" High-temperature superconductors are a class of materials that can conduct electricity with almost zero resistance at temperatures that are relatively high compared to their standard counterparts, which must be chilled to nearly absolute zero—the coldest temperature possible. The high-temperature materials are exciting because they hold the possibility of revolutionizing modern life, such as by facilitating ultra-efficient energy transmission or being used to create cutting-edge quantum computers. One particular group of high-temperature superconductors, the cuprates, has been studied for 30 years, yet scientists still cannot fully explain how they work: What goes on inside a “typical” cuprate? Piecing together a complete picture of their electronic behavior is vital to engineering the “holy grail” of cuprates: a versatile, robust material that can superconduct at room temperature and ambient pressure. To that end, a research group led by scientists from the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Brookhaven National Laboratory recently discovered new information about the electronic behavior of a particular cuprate using an x-ray technique that has not—until now—been widely used to study them. Working in part at Brookhaven Lab’s National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II), a DOE Office of Science User Facility, the researchers used a form of x-ray scattering to investigate a specific arrangement of electric charge that arises in cuprates: an ordered pattern of electrons known as a charge-density wave (CDW)."</em> <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=217349">[...]</a>

These characteristics have the potential to make robots ideal for setting up wireless sensor networks in hazardous environments—that is, they could deploy a whole bunch of self-contained sensor nodes that create a network that can monitor a very large area for a very long time. When it comes to using drones to set up sensor networks, you’ve generally got two options: A drone that just drops sensors on the ground (easy but inaccurate and limited locations), or using a drone with some sort of manipulator on it to stick sensors in specific places (complicated and risky). A third option, under development by researchers at Imperial College London’s Aerial Robotics Lab, provides the accuracy of direct contact with the safety and ease of use of passive dropping by instead using the drone as a launching platform for laser-aimed, sensor-equipped darts. These darts (which the researchers refer to as aerodynamically stabilized, spine-equipped sensor pods) can embed themselves in relatively soft targets from up to 4 meters away with an accuracy of about 10 centimeters after being fired from a spring-loaded launcher."</em> <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/drones/dart-shooting-drone">[...]</a>

A complete system is described that perceives persons in the environment, identifies persons-of-interest based on salient actions, selects an appropriate gaze behavior, and executes high, fidelity motions to respond to the stimuli. We use mechanisms that mimic motor and attention behaviors analogous to those observed in biological systems including attention habituation, saccades, and differences in motion bandwidth for actuators.

<p><em>"Algorithms developed at EPFL can help architects to design building structures that incorporate both new and reused components, thereby lowering their environmental impact. The construction industry is among the world’s most polluting sectors: in developed countries it accounts for some 40% of CO2 emissions. It consumes up to half of all resources and generates about a third of all waste. As a result, in order to comply with international treaties and the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, the industry is being forced to take bold steps to reduce its environmental footprint. “We need to mitigate this impact as quickly as possible," says Jan Brütting, who has just completed a PhD at EPFL’s Structural Xploration Lab (SXL), headed by Corentin Fivet from the Smart Living Lab in Fribourg. “One way to achieve this is by systematically implementing the principles of the circular economy.” When designing a building, instead of using new components or even recycling existing metal parts by melting them down and casting them into new shapes, Brütting encourages companies, structural engineers and architects to base their designs on previously-used components, without reprocessing them."</em> <a href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/computational-methods-to-ease-the-reuse-of-constru/">[...]</a>

As the team slowly reduced the material's electron density, they first saw an expected result: its magnetic properties became weaker until they disappeared altogether. While very few systems have explored electron density at this level, the mathematics made sense of the results to that point. The researchers had surpassed a critical threshold. But because they were working with a rare material system that allowed them to study these effects at even lower densities, they decided to keep going and push the experiment to its physical brink."</em> <a href="https://engineering.princeton.edu/news/2020/11/05/strange-quasi-particles-reveal-new-magnetic-behavior-verify-nearly-century-old">[...]</a>

When the soil is heated to a certain temperature, the gels release the water, making it available to plants. When the soil distributes water, some of it goes back into the air, increasing humidity and making it easier to continue the harvesting cycle. “Enabling free-standing agriculture in areas where it’s hard to build up irrigation and power systems is crucial to liberating crop farming from the complex water supply chain as resources become increasingly scarce,” said Guihua Yu, associate professor of materials science in the Walker Department of Mechanical Engineering.

In the world of subatomic particles and giant particle detectors, and distant galaxies and giant telescopes, scientists have learned to live, and to work, with uncertainty. They are often trying to tease out ultra-rare particle interactions from a massive tangle of other particle interactions and background “noise” that can complicate their hunt, or trying to filter out the effects of atmospheric distortions and interstellar dust to improve the resolution of astronomical imaging. Also, inherent problems with detectors, such as with their ability to record all particle interactions or to exactly measure particles’ energies, can result in data getting misread by the electronics they are connected to, so scientists need to design complex filters, in the form of computer algorithms, to reduce the margin of error and return the most accurate results. The problems of noise and physical defects, and the need for error-correction and error-mitigation algorithms, which reduce the frequency and severity of errors, are also common in the fledgling field of quantum computing, and a study published in the journal npj Quantum Information found that there appear to be some common solutions, too.

This module allowed computer manufacturers to double the density of their memory systems and by 1982, Mostek had sold over 3 million modules. The Apple III is the best-known system that used these memory modules. This module was built from two 16-kilobit memory chips, constructed from the standard MK4116 dynamic RAM (DRAM) chip packaged in a leadless ceramic chip carrier; these are the golden rectangles on top of the carrier.

<p><em>"A solar-powered node that stores energy in a supercapacitor, wakes-up regularly, measures different parameters, and sends them to a gateway The main idea is to create a relatively small device that measures temperature and humidity (or anything else using a low-power i2c sensor), sends data to a gateway, and never requires a battery change. In the current iteration, I going to use an ATmega328P microcontroller, RFM69W transceiver, 1-1.5F supercapacitor, and some additional components to provide over/under voltage protection.

We have gone through a lot of research from a lot of websites including this one to make this project worked as it should. So what I am trying to do is to give you guys my 2 cents of knowledge to you guys/students/girls/teacher/lecturer/robots or whatever you are. So, in this "Instructable" I will share, how to create a useable and reliable Home Automation System or Smart Home for you to recreate at your own comfort. Also, I will share how to create your own simple web server for your NodeMCU ESP8266 and how to create your own MIT APP Inventor.

<p><em>"My grandfather tries to exercise regularly on the gym cycle he has, however, the display for the cycle is broken. Therefore he is unable to see the distance travelled by him after exercising for a certain period of time. The LCD used on the gym cycle to display the data was custom made and could not be replicated. He was unwilling to exercise without an indication of the distance travelled. Therefore, I came up with this solution where my grandfather could still measure the number of cycle revolutions over a certain period of time and calculate the distance travelled. This project won't apply for regular cycles, but for exercise bikes, it is a perfect option if the LCD display is old or damaged."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Based-Tachometer-for-Gym-Cycles/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A sensor is a device that detects and responds to inputs from the physical environment. The input can be light, heat, motion, moisture, pressure, or any other environmental phenomena. Sensors are very important part of electronics, especially in Robotics and Automations. The output generated by the sensors are transmitted to other circuits for reading or for further processing. They make our life easy by automatically sensing and controlling devices, without human interaction. In this tutorial, we are going to talk about "IR sensors" or Infrared sensors, how they work and how to build a "DIY IR Sensor Module"."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/DIY-IR-Module/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In this Instructable I show you how I made a battery powered sensor to monitor the door and lock status of my remote bike shed. I have nog mains power, therefor I have it battery powered. The battery is charged by a small solar panel. The module is designed for low power operation and runs on an ESP-07S in deep sleep which wakes up and checks the door and lock position every minute. However, when the door is opened, the module is woken by a simple hardware circuit to immediately send the 'door open' information. The module communicates via ESP-Now, in which the transmission time is very short, requiring only a small amount of energy."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Battery-Powered-Shed-Door-Lock-Sensor-Solar-ESP826/">[...]</a>

Our brain processes sounds through its ability to transform the sound waves picked up by our ears. But wouldn't it be fun to really be able to visualize these waves and try to understand them as well? That's what I tried to do with this project. A microphone captures the waves, transforms them into electrical signals that can be processed by a microcontroller and displayed on a screen. Of course, it has to be fun, fast, informative and portable."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Portable-Sound-Analyzer-on-ESP32/">[...]</a>
