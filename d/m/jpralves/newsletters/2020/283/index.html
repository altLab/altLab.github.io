<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1842, o inventor e poeta francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Cros">Charles Cros</a>. Ele projectou um telégrafo automático e exibiu-o na Feira Mundial de 1867. Ele enviou à Société française de photographie, em 1869, um sistema de reprodução de imagens coloridas. Além disso, ele entregou planos viáveis em 18 de abril de 1877 para a Académie des Sciences, para um aparelho chamado paleofone, que era o princípio do gramofone. Assim, ele teve a ideia antes de Edison. No entanto, ele morreu na pobreza e nunca foi reconhecido pelas suas descobertas em vida, devido a concorrentes mais influentes e com melhor financiamento.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1881, o pioneiro da aviação americana <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_E._Boeing">William E. Boeing</a>. Ele começou a interessar-se pela aviação quando treinou na escola de voo de Glenn L. Martin em 1915 e comprou sua própria aeronave. Em 1916, Boeing co-fundou a Pacific Aero Products Company (logo renomeada como Boeing Airplane Company). Em 1920, ele recebeu uma grande encomenda de guerra para 200 aviões de combate MB-3. A Boeing Air Transport começou a transportar correio e passageiros em Julho de 1927. Por meio de fusões com outras indústrias de aeronaves, ele construiu a United Aircraft and Air Transport, a empresa de aviação mais lucrativa do seu tempo. Em 1934, a acção da concorrência do governo dividiu a companhia. A United Airlines tornou-se uma empresa independente. Mantém-se até aos dias de hoje como uma das duas grandes companhia de fabrico de aviões comerciais.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1939, o Astrofísico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Robert_Carruthers">George Robert Carruthers</a>. Ele foi o principal inventor de uma nova câmara espacial para medir a luz ultravioleta que pode ser usada para identificar átomos e moléculas interestelares. Após vários anos em desenvolvimento, foi levada à lua na missão Apollo 16 (1972). Posicionada na superfície da lua, a câmara também pode capturar imagens dos gases da atmosfera terrestre. A concentração de poluentes, como o monóxido de carbono, no ar ao redor de grandes cidades pode ser determinada para muitas cidades ao mesmo tempo. Outras câmaras espaciais desenvolvidas por Carruthers e seus colegas pesquisaram a camada de ozono e transmitiram fotos de estrelas e planetas distantes para análise por computador. Ele também foi pioneiro no desenvolvimento de telescópios electrónicos.</p>

<p>Em 1880, a primeira fábrica de lâmpadas incandescentes eléctricas dos EUA foi inaugurada em Menlo Park, N. J. The Edison Lamp Works. No espaço de um ano e meio foram produzidas mais de 130.000 lâmpadas.</p>

<p>Faz hoje anos que o primeiro protótipo do Concorde (001) passou a barreira do som. O seu primeiro voo tinha sido seis meses antes. Foi durante o seu 102º voo de teste que atingiu Mach 2. O seu "irmão" Inglês alcançou o mesmo resultado uma semana depois. O Concorde foi o primeiro avião do mundo totalmente controlado por computador. No início, grupos ambientais criticaram o ruído do Concorde durante a descolagem e o consumo de combustível. O seu impacto nas viagens aéreas internacionais foi limitado pelos altos custos de operação da aeronave. Apenas a British Airways e a Air France operaram a aeronave. O serviço terminou com voos finais de passageiros a 24 de Outubro de 2003. Não existe até à data nenhuma outra forma comercial de viajar tão rápido.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos assim como projetos de maker.</p>

<p><em>"Low-power MCU family offers power-saving peripherals, hardware safety and secure code protection System developers of battery-powered and other power-conscious designs with and without LCD displays can now easily add an array of innovative features using a new line of PIC® eXtreme Low Power (XLP) microcontrollers (MCUs) from Microchip Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP). Packed with 14 types of Core Independent Peripherals (CIPs) that operate outside the Central Processing Unit (CPU) for power savings, the PIC24F GU and GL families of MCUs feature the CIP called LCD with Autonomous Animation. Most display applications involve a few common animations like periodically alternating between displays and blinking of pixels to indicate operation. By using the integrated LCD driver with autonomous animation, developers can offload most of these simple animation routines from the CPU, allowing animation even in doze, idle or sleep modes for optimal power savings. To assist in quickly designing such display interfaces, the new MCUs come with MPLAB® Code Configurator (MCC) support. This graphical programming environment with LCD display designer helps eliminate the meticulous and time-consuming task of mapping the pins and segments."</em> <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en/pressreleasepage/pic24f-mcus-with-low-power-animated-display-driver">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Seven studies describe progress thus far and challenges ahead for a revolutionary zero-emissions power source. Two and a half years ago, MIT entered into a research agreement with startup company Commonwealth Fusion Systems to develop a next-generation fusion research experiment, called SPARC, as a precursor to a practical, emissions-free power plant. Now, after many months of intensive research and engineering work, the researchers charged with defining and refining the physics behind the ambitious tokamak design have published a series of papers summarizing the progress they have made and outlining the key research questions SPARC will enable. Overall, says Martin Greenwald, deputy director of MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center and one of the project’s lead scientists, the work is progressing smoothly and on track. This series of papers provides a high level of confidence in the plasma physics and the performance predictions for SPARC, he says. No unexpected impediments or surprises have shown up, and the remaining challenges appear to be manageable."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/physics-fusion-studies-0929">[...]</a>

The proof-of-principle system consists of a novel receiver and corresponding signal-processing technique that, unlike the methods used in today’s networks, are entirely based on the properties of quantum physics and thereby capable of handling even extremely weak signals with pulses that carry many bits of data. “We built the communication test bed using off-the-shelf components to demonstrate that quantum-measurement-enabled communication can potentially be scaled up for widespread commercial use,” said Ivan Burenkov, a physicist at the Joint Quantum Institute, a research partnership between NIST and the University of Maryland. Burenkov and his colleagues report the results in Physical Review X Quantum. “Our eﬀort shows that quantum measurements oﬀer valuable, heretofore unforeseen advantages for telecommunications leading to revolutionary improvements in channel bandwidth and energy efficiency.” Modern communications systems work by converting information into a laser-generated stream of digital light pulses in which information is encoded — in the form of changes to the properties of the light waves — for transfer and then decoded when it reaches the receiver. The train of pulses grows fainter as it travels along transmission channels, and conventional electronic technology for receiving and decoding data has reached the limit of its ability to precisely detect the information in such attenuated signals."</em> <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2020/09/quantum-matchmaking-new-nist-system-detects-ultra-faint-communications">[...]</a>

Their compact Hyperspectral Stripe Projector (HSP) is a step toward a new method to collect the spatial and spectral information required for self-driving cars, machine vision, crop monitoring, surface wear and corrosion detection and other applications. “I can envision this technology in the hands of a farmer, or on a drone, to look at a field and see not only the nutrients and water content of plants but also, because of the 3D aspect, the height of the crops,” said Kevin Kelly, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at Rice’s Brown School of Engineering. “Or perhaps it can look at a painting and see the surface colors and texture in detail, but with near-infrared also see underneath to the canvas.” Kelly’s lab could enable 3D spectroscopy on the fly with a system that combines the HSP, a monochrome sensor array and sophisticated programming to give users a more complete picture of an object’s shape and composition. “We’re getting four-dimensional information from an image, three spatial and one spectral, in real time,” Kelly said. “Other people use multiple modulators and thus require bright light sources to accomplish this, but we found we could do it with a light source of normal brightness and some clever optics.” The work by Kelly, lead author and Rice alumna Yibo Xu and graduate student Anthony Giljum is detailed in an open-access paper in Optics Express."</em> <a href="https://news.rice.edu/2020/09/24/3d-camera-earns-its-stripes-at-rice/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Pixie was a project developed with the intention of making the plants we have at home more interactive, since for most people one of the challenges of having a plant at home is to know how to take care of it, how often we water, when and how much sun is enough, etc. While sensors work to obtain plant data, a LED display, purposely pixelated (hence the name Pixie), displays basic expressions that indicate the state of the plant, such as joy while it is being watered or sadness if the temperature is too high, indicating that it should be taken to a cooler place. To make the experience even more interesting, other sensors such as presence, touch and luminosity have been added, translating into other expressions that make it seem that you now have a virtual pet to take care of. The project has several parameters where it is possible to customize the limits and needs of each case, considering the diversity of plants as well as sensors of different brands. As we know, there are plants that need more sun or water while others can live with fewer resources, such as cacti for example, in cases like this, having parameters is a must have. Throughout this article, I will present the operation and an overview about how to build a Pixie using a little knowledge of electronics, components easily found in the market and a 3d printed case."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Pixie-Let-Your-Plant-Smart/">[...]</a>

I used a Microchip ATtiny85 that basically relays the signals from a USB/UART cable."</em> <a href="https://www.mikekohn.net/micro/water_optic_communication.php">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Hello makers in this post about DIY automatic Arduino based bobbin winding machine. Bobbins are the small metal spools used in sewing machine, bobbins are filled with thread to stich cloths. This bobbins are frequently getting empty and you need to rewind it with thread again and again. So I made this machine it can automatically wind thread to maximum 12 bobbins in single run. there are already many bobbin winding machines are available in market. But there prices are more than 500$ but my this DIY arduino based bobbin winding machine can build under 100$."</em> <a href="https://electricdiylab.com/diy-arduino-based-bobbin-winding-machine/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/gabonator/LA104">LA104 pocket logic analyser operating system</a></h2>

<p><em>"LA104 is another nice piece of handheld hardware coming from e-design / miniware company similar to their previous product - pocket digital storage oscillosope DS203. This time they designed wholly digital device without analog circuitry featuring 4 general purpose IO signals and 4 digital inputs processed by AG1K FPGA chip, the processor used is the same as in DS203 - STM32F103VCT6. Device is battery powered, charged through USB micro connector, its display (ILI9341) offers resolution of 320x240 pixels and the storage EEPROM has this time capacity of 8MB. Check the scheme here Flashing is done by holding first function button during powering up and by copying firmware HEX file onto the virtual flash USB drive formatted as FAT12. This could be tricky, since this approach does not work on Mac OSX. For some reason the default copying procedure after mounting this USB drive on OSX is different than the programmers at e-design expected, it works reliably only on Windows machines."</em> <a href="https://github.com/gabonator/LA104">[...]</a>

<p><em>"An open-source IoT platform to monitor and prevent epidemics such as Malaria, Dengue and the Zika Virus. This solar-powered device eliminates mosquito larvae in stagnant water bodies such as water tanks, swamps and micro-dams. The system allows mosquitoes to lay eggs at dawn and dusk and the intermittent ripples during the day prevent larvae from breathing at the surface. In addition, a built-in microphone captures the wing-beat frequencies of mosquitoes that are naturally attracted to standing water, helping us to identify the species and sex of the mosquito. With a network of these connected devices installed among at-risk populations, we will obtain a real-time estimate of the presence of dangerous mosquitoes. Using this data, we will create the early warning system for all mosquito-borne epidemics."</em> <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/174575-solar-scare-mosquito-20">[...]</a>
