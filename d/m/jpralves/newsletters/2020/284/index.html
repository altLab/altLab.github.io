<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1850, o químico francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Louis_Le_Chatelier">Henry Louis Le Chatelier</a>. Ele ficou conhecido pelo princípio de Le Chatelier, que permite prever o efeito que uma mudança nas condições (temperatura, pressão e concentração dos componentes da reacção) terá sobre uma reacção química. Este princípio provou ser inestimável na indústria química para o desenvolvimento de processos químicos mais eficientes. Fritz Haber utilizou-o com sucesso em seu processo de produção de amónia. Os interesses de Le Chatelier começaram em metalurgia, cimentos, cerâmica e vidro, nos seus estudos de chamas que o levaram a estudar o calor e sua medição. De várias contribuições à termometria, a sua mais importante foi o primeiro projecto bem-sucedido de um termopar de platina e ródio para medir altas temperaturas (1887).</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1869, o inventor norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Frank_Duryea">Frank Duryea</a>. Ele em conjunto com o seu irmão Charles Duryea construiram o primeiro automóvel com várias cópias fabricado nos Estados Unidos. Em 28 de Novembro de 1895, Frank dirigiu seu carro para ganhar o primeiro prémio na primeira corrida de automóveis americana em Chicago, realizada pelo Chicago Times-Herald. Às 8h55, seis "motas" deixaram o Jackson Park em Chicago para uma corrida de 54 milhas até Evanston, Illinois, e de volta pela neve. O nº 5 de Duryeas levou pouco mais de 10 horas (média de 7,3 mph). No início de 1896, os Duryeas fabricaram 13 cópias do carro. Frank desenvolveu a “Stevens-Duryea”, uma limusina cara, que permaneceu em produção na década de 1920. Os irmãos são reconhecidos como “Pais da Indústria Automobilística Americana”.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1913, o cientista aeroespacial norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_R._Gilruth">Robert Rowe Gilruth</a>. Ele foi um dos pioneiros dos programas espaciais Mercury, Gemini e Apollo. Ele desenvolveu o X-1, o primeiro avião a quebrar a barreira do som. Gilruth dirigiu o Projecto Mercury, o programa inicial para realizar voos espaciais tripulados. Sob a sua liderança, o primeiro astronauta americano orbitou a Terra apenas um pouco mais de 3 anos após a criação da NASA. Em 1961, o presidente Kennedy e o Congresso comprometeram a nação com uma aterragem lunar tripulada dentro de uma década. Gilruth foi nomeado o Director do Centro de Naves Espaciais Tripuladas e recebeu a responsabilidade de projectar e desenvolver a nave espacial e equipamentos associados, planear e controlar missões e treinar tripulações de voo.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou a AMD apresentou os processadores AMD Ryzen série 5000 para desktop desenvolvidos com base na nova arquitectura de núcleo “Zen 3” que oferecem desempenho de liderança abrangente para jogadores e criadores de conteúdo. Oferecendo até 16 núcleos, 32 threads e 72 MB de cache no processador AMD Ryzen 9 5950X, os processadores da série AMD Ryzen 5000 dominam em cargas de trabalho pesadamente segmentadas e eficiência energética, enquanto o processador AMD Ryzen 9 5900X oferece para um aumento de geração de 26% no desempenho de jogos. Com amplas melhorias em todo o núcleo, incluindo um complexo unificado de 8 núcleos com acesso directo ao cache L3 de 32 MB, a nova arquitectura de núcleo “Zen 3” da AMD oferece um aumento de geração de 19% em instruções por ciclo (IPC), o maior desde a introdução de processadores “Zen” em 2017.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou, e ao fim de cinco tentativas, a SpaceX colocou em órbita mais 60 satélites da Starlink. O lançamento marca a 17ª missão da SpaceX até agora em 2020, e seu 94º vôo do Falcon 9 até o momento. A frota de propulsores de voo comprovados da empresa tem estado ocupada este ano, com o construtor de foguetes com sede na Califórnia alcançando alguns novos marcos, incluindo o lançamento e pouso do mesmo propulsor de primeiro estágio seis vezes.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos assim como projetos de maker.</p>

<p><em>"Octal 12-bit DAC combines nonvolatile memory with an integrated reference voltage to eliminate processor overhead during power-up while enabling smaller, space-constrained systems Implementing multi-channel system control or signal outputs using Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs) in today’s portable and handheld industrial, communications, consumer and medical systems has been difficult to do without significant processor overhead for device configuration during power-up. Microchip Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP) today announced a solution to this problem with its MCP47/48FxBx8 family of octal 12-bit DACs, the first of their kind to include nonvolatile memory and an integrated Voltage Reference (Vref) source so they can be pre-configured for safe and efficient power-up without relying on the system processor. “Handhelds and other portable systems are expected to deliver more capabilities in smaller, simpler designs,” said Bryan J. Liddiard, vice president of Microchip’s mixed-signal and linear business unit. “We help achieve this goal with the first DACs that eliminate processor overhead during power-up and provide the channel density, low power consumption and integrated features that today’s compact systems need so they can operate over longer periods using smaller, lighter batteries.” Unlike DACs that do not feature nonvolatile memory, the MCP47/48FxBx8 DACs can store user-customized configuration data even when powered down. At power-up, all eight channels are then configured to the pre-defined state without burdening the system processor with this overhead. Integrating a Vref source into the DACs reduces overall system size and complexity while providing the necessary control to meet critical timing needs for safely driving all power outputs."</em> <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en/pressreleasepage/microchips-first-low-power-dac-simplifies-handheld-designs-with-nvm">[...]</a>

The findings, titled "Fluctuation-induced current from freestanding graphene," and published in the journal Physical Review E, are proof of a theory the physicists developed at the U of A three years ago that freestanding graphene — a single layer of carbon atoms — ripples and buckles in a way that holds promise for energy harvesting. The idea of harvesting energy from graphene is controversial because it refutes physicist Richard Feynman’s well-known assertion that the thermal motion of atoms, known as Brownian motion, cannot do work. Thibado’s team found that at room temperature the thermal motion of graphene does in fact induce an alternating current (AC) in a circuit, an achievement thought to be impossible. In the 1950s, physicist Léon Brillouin published a landmark paper refuting the idea that adding a single diode, a one-way electrical gate, to a circuit is the solution to harvesting energy from Brownian motion."</em> <a href="https://news.uark.edu/articles/54830/physicists-build-circuit-that-generates-clean-limitless-power-from-graphene">[...]</a>

With magnetars, the beams are believed to be powered by extremely strong magnetic fields, whereas in canonical pulsars they are powered by the rapid rotation of the star. However, there is much that is not well understood about these phenomena."</em> <a href="https://www.riken.jp/en/news_pubs/research_news/pr/2020/20201005_2/index.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"For 100 years scientists have disagreed on how to interpret quantum mechanics. A recent study by Jussi Lindgren and Jukka Liukkonen supports an interpretation that is close to classical scientific principles. Quantum mechanics arose in the 1920s – and since then scientists have disagreed on how best to interpret it. Many interpretations, including the Copenhagen interpretation presented by Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg and in particular von Neumann-Wigner interpretation, state that the consciousness of the person conducting the test affects its result. On the other hand, Karl Popper and Albert Einstein thought that an objective reality exists. Erwin Schrödinger put forward the famous thought experiment involving the fate of an unfortunate cat that aimed to describe the imperfections of quantum mechanics."</em> <a href="https://www.aalto.fi/en/news/a-new-interpretation-of-quantum-mechanics-suggests-that-reality-does-not-depend-on-the-person">[...]</a>

The motivation behind this is that the N64 has some really great games, but the controller hardware is rather bad- the joysticks wear out quickly, and the layout is odd. The GameCube controllers, however, have a superset of the features and a much better joystick. A secondary goal of this project is to more thoroughly reverse engineer the protocols involved and create reusable libraries for interfacing PIC microcontrollers to N64 and GameCube devices. The very basics of reverse engineering the two protocols were done before Micah (@scanlime) started this project, but she quickly discovered that there's much more to the protocol. We believe this project may be the first one to completely reverse engineer the protocol used by standard N64 controllers, including peripherals like the Controller and Rumble Paks."</em> <a href="https://github.com/darthcloud/cube64-dx">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Feed the poultry in quotidian routine to condition them - sensory preconditioning - to improve egg production and hatching process. I was keeping quails, chickens, and ducks in my garden before I moved, but it was struggling to manage to feed them in quotidian routine - day-to-day - to accustom them to a new egg production schedule. Also, I was trying to apply sensory preconditioning - repeated simultaneous presentations of two neutral stimuli (sound and light) - while feeding them to improve egg production rate, and it is mandatory to warn the poultry with light and sound while practicing sensory preconditioning. Hence, I had developed a bird feeder with the Arduino Nano as a budget-friendly solution to the problems I had encountered. In this project, I will discuss an enhanced version of my previous bird feeder for those who need a cheap device to practice sensory preconditioning with the poultry. To obtain current time, date, and temperature, I used a DS3231 RTC module."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/kutluhan-aktar/arduino-rtc-bird-feeder-v2-0-for-poultry-conditioning-a2330b">[...]</a>

The primary goal while building this project was to make the system as robust as possible such that while experimenting with various walking and running gaits I wouldn't have to constantly worry about the hardware failing. This allowed me to push the hardware to its limit and experiment with complex gaits and motions.

I had spent some time looking at different sensors from the electronics shop I had ordered some things from and came across a gesture sensor! I thought it would be pretty cool to see what I could use it for and so I ordered one. I'm also learning lots about LEDs and the LED Matrix, so I thought it would be good to combine the two and create a set of moving eyes that could be used on a prop, as a puppet, or just something to make on a rainy afternoon.

<p><em>"Hobbyist PCB making has become much more accessible. Circuit boards that contain only through-hole components are easy to solder but the size of the board is ultimately limited by the component's size. As such, utilizing surface mount components enable a more compact PCB design but is much more difficult to solder by hand. Reflow ovens provide a method that makes SMD soldering significantly easier. They work by cycling through a temperature profile that provides a consistent escalation in temperature which melts the solder paste underneath the surface mount components.

<p><em>"Electromyography is a technique used for recording the electrical activity of a muscle. In order for a muscle to move, it must receive an electrical signal from the brain via a motor neuron, with the frequency of nerve impulses controlling the force of contraction. This generates a potential difference on the surface of the skin (in the magnitude of 30micro - 50millivolts)* which the EMG circuit can pick up and amplify to around 1-2V, allowing it to be easily read on an analog pin of a microcontroller such as Arduino. The simplest EMG circuit has 3 electrodes and can measure the electrical activity of one muscle. 2 electrodes are placed next to each other in the middle of the muscle, approx. 3-8cm apart, and the 3rd one is grounded and placed on a bone or held in hand and acts as a reference electrode."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Simple-Dry-Electrode-EMG-for-Arduino/">[...]</a>
