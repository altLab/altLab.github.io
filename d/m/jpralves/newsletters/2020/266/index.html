<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1756 o químico francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Antoine_Chaptal">Jean-Antoine Chaptal</a>. Ele foi o autor do primeiro livro sobre química industrial. Foi também ele que deu o nome "nitrogénio". A sua actividade técnica abrangeu um amplo campo, como melhorias na fabricação de ácido sulfúrico, salitre para pólvora, açúcar de raiz de beterraba, vinho, tingimento, branqueamento entre outras coisas. Ele foi o primeiro a produzir comercialmente ácido sulfúrico na França na sua fábrica em Montpellier. A sua carreira abrangeu o período tempestuoso da Revolução Francesa. Ele foi preso, mas teve mais sorte do que o brilhante Antoine Lavoisier (que foi guilhotinado) e depois libertado para gerir as obras de salitre em Grenelle. Ele também ajudou a organizar a introdução do sistema métrico.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1877, o químico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Otto_Wieland">Heinrich Otto Wieland</a>. Ele ganhou do Prémio Nobel de Química de 1927 pelos seus estudos de química de esteróides, nos quais determinou a estrutura molecular dos ácidos biliares. Ele também é conhecido por estudar a conversão de alimentos em energia. Em 1912, ele começou a trabalhar em ácidos biliares, secreções do fígado conhecidas há quase um século por consistirem num grande número de substâncias. Ele estudou três deles: ácido cólico, ácido desoxicólico e ácido litocólico, descobrindo que todos eram esteróides, muito semelhantes entre si, e todos convertíveis em ácido colânico. Depois de 1921, ele estudou alguns alcalóides curiosos, incluindo toxiferina (ingrediente activo do curare), bufotalina (no veneno de sapos) e faloidina e amatina (ingredientes venenosos no mortífero cogumelo amanita).</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1910, o inventor inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Cockerell">Christopher Cockerell</a>. Ele é responsável pela invenção do hovercraft. Ele era engenheiro electrotécnico na Marconi Company (1935-50), onde trabalhou em equipamentos de navegação aérea e radar. Posteriormente ele criou um negócio de aluguer de barcos. Considerando o arrasto da água no casco de um barco, ele teve a ideia de elevar o barco numa almofada de ar. Em 1954, ele realizou um teste crucial usando balanças de cozinha, latas e um aspirador de pó para mostrar que uma corrente de ar poderia produzir a elevação necessária. No ano seguinte, ele construiu um modelo de madeira balsa em funcionamento com um motor de aeronave. O primeiro protótipo em escala real, o SR-N1, pesava 7 toneladas e era capaz de 60 nós. Atravessou o Canal da Mancha em 1959 (com Cockerell a bordo). O Hovercraft entrou em serviço regular entre canais em 1968.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou, e após um adiamento de dias, foi finalmente lançado o foguetão da SpaceX, com dois astronautas a bordo, em direcção à estação espacial internacional. No dia 30 cumpriu-se mais um passo histórico na conquista espacial quando astronautas norte-americanos foram lançados dentro de um foguetão comercial. A nave Crew Dragon transportou Robert Behnken e Douglas Hurley, sendo a primeira missão de teste com tripulantes humanos. Denominada de SpaceX Demo-2 esta missão tem como objectivo testar o voo do inicio ao fim para validar a capacidade de transporte de tripulação, durante o lançamento, em órbita, na acoplagem e na aterragem.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou foi lançado o Kernel 5.7 do Linux. Depois de sete RC foi dado o "sign-off" para a primeira versão oficial desta familiar de Kernels. As principais novidades são melhorias diversas na arquitectura ARM de 64-bits, melhoria do suporte de HDR/OLED nomeadamente o controlo do Backlight, foram também introduzidas melhorias diversas no sistema de I/O, novo driver de filesystem exFAT, actualizações dos filesystems F2FS, XFS e Btrfs, suporte para o Apple USB Fast Charge, suporte para novos dispositivos de hardware de som, assim como muitas outras melhorias.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos assim como projetos de maker.</p>

<p><em>"For the first time in history, NASA astronauts have launched from American soil in a commercially built and operated American crew spacecraft on its way to the International Space Station. The SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft carrying NASA astronauts Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley lifted off at 3:22 p.m. EDT Saturday on the company’s Falcon 9 rocket from Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. “Today a new era in human spaceflight begins as we once again launched American astronauts on American rockets from American soil on their way to the International Space Station, our national lab orbiting Earth,” said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. “I thank and congratulate Bob Behnken, Doug Hurley, and the SpaceX and NASA teams for this significant achievement for the United States. The launch of this commercial space system designed for humans is a phenomenal demonstration of American excellence and is an important step on our path to expand human exploration to the Moon and Mars.” Known as NASA’s SpaceX Demo-2, the mission is an end-to-end test flight to validate the SpaceX crew transportation system, including launch, in-orbit, docking and landing operations. This is SpaceX’s second spaceflight test of its Crew Dragon and its first test with astronauts aboard, which will pave the way for its certification for regular crew flights to the station as part of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-astronauts-launch-from-america-in-historic-test-flight-of-spacex-crew-dragon">[...]</a>

<p><em>"There were some compromises involved in taking to the skies. Electric aircraft are ever so slightly closer to becoming a practical reality for travel. Magnix and AeroTEC have flown what they say is the world’s largest all-electric aircraft. Their modified Cessna 208B Grand Caravan, the “eCaravan,” flew for 30 minutes around Washington state’s Grand County International Airport using Magnix’s 750HP Magni500 motor instead of the usual turboprop engine. The flight was “flawless,” Magnix chief Roei Ganzarski said in a statement to FlightGlobal.

<p><em>"More than 250 million computers are sold each year and NetMarketShare reports that 2.87 percent – roughly 7.2 million users – are using those computers to run Linux®1. Once thought of as a niche IT crowd, this user base of data scientists, developers, application engineers, scientists and more is growing – stepping into sought-after roles across multiple industries and becoming essential within their companies. Now, I’m excited to share Lenovo is moving to certify the full workstation portfolio for top Linux distributions from Ubuntu® and Red Hat® – every model, every configuration.

The launch is the second in five days for the California-based rocket builder. On Saturday (May 30), a different Falcon 9 rocket sent NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley toward the International Space Station aboard a Crew Dragon capsule, kicking of SpaceX's landmark Demo-2 mission. The duo docked with the orbiting lab about 19 hours later and will remain there from one to four months. In stark contrast to Saturday's shiny new booster, today's mission featured a veteran member of SpaceX's rocket fleet. The extra-sooty Falcon 9 — whose first stage had already flown four times before today's mission — lifted off at 9:25 p.m. EDT (0125 GMT on June 4) from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station here in Florida, its white exterior scorched by its previous trips through the atmosphere."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-starlink-internet-satellites-launch-success-june-2020.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"EPFL researchers have developed a new tool called USBFuzz, which they have already used to detect 26 vulnerabilities in the USB driver stacks of widely used operating systems including Linux, Windows, and macOS. USB driver stacks are components that help computers communicate with external devices via the Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection. USB connections – used with devices like external hard drives, keyboards, mice, or cameras – can open up computers to attack if their operating systems contain vulnerabilities. To help detect such vulnerabilities, EPFL researchers developed a software security tool called a fuzzer, which allows them to test a computer’s ability to thwart an attack by emulating a USB device. The tool, called USBFuzz, delivers bits of random data to a target computer before autonomously observing how well the computer’s software handles the unexpected inputs.

But traditional transistors can only shrink so much. Now, researchers at Stevens Institute of Technology have developed a new atomically thin magnetic semiconductor that will allow the development of new transistors that work in a completely different way; they not only can harness an electron’s charge but also the power of its spin, providing an alternative path to creating ever smaller and faster electronics. Rather than relying on making smaller and smaller electrical components, the new discovery, reported in the April 2020 issue of Nature Communications, potentially provides a critical platform for advancing the field of spintronics (spin + electronics), a fundamentally new way to operate electronics and a much-needed alternative to continued miniaturization of standard electronic devices. In addition to removing the miniaturization barrier, the new atomically thin magnet can also enable faster processing speed, less energy consumption and increased storage capacity. “A two-dimensional ferromagnetic semiconductor is a material in which ferromagnetism and semiconducting properties coexist in one, and since our material works at room temperature, it allows us to readily integrate it with the well-established semiconductor technology,” said EH Yang, a professor of mechanical engineering at Stevens Institute of Technology, who led this project."</em> <a href="https://www.stevens.edu/news/atomically-thin-magnets-next-generation-spin-and-quantum-electronics">[...]</a>

The first Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) mission, launched in 2006, used a technique known as radio occultation to derive vertical atmospheric profiles of temperature, humidity, and pressure by measuring the degree to which GPS signals bend as they travel through Earth’s atmosphere. The resulting flood of high-quality, extremely accurate data was provided to weather centers to improve forecasts and to research institutions for use in scientific studies. Throughout its lifetime, COSMIC-1 made an astounding 7 million vertical atmospheric profiles available to the operational forecast centers and research community.

Now, a new set of simulations by a research team led by UC San Diego’s Alexey Arefiev point the way toward making matter from light. The process starts by aiming a high-power laser at a target to generate a magnetic field as strong as that of a neutron star. This field generates gamma ray emissions that collide to produce—for the very briefest instant—pairs of matter and antimatter particles.

Dr. Avi Loeb, Frank B.

Researchers have discovered a single molecule ‘switch’ that can act like a transistor and offers the potential to store binary information – such as the 1s and 0s used in classical computing. The molecule is around five square nanometres in size. This means that more than one billion of them would fit onto the cross-section of a human hair. The international team of scientists behind the breakthrough believe that molecules like the ones they have discovered could offer information density of around 250 terabits per square inch – which is around 100 times the storage density of current hard drives. Although the researchers do not expect that the particular molecules they discovered will be used in real hard drives, the study is an important proof of concept that brings us closer to the brave new world of true molecular electronics."</em> <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/methods-lancaster/news/smart-molecules-could-be-key-to-computers-with-100-times-bigger-memories">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/06/nanomagnets.html">New optical technique provides more efficient probe of nanomagnet dynamics</a></h2>

<p><em>"Data storage devices and other emerging technologies use magnetic elements smaller than 100 nanometers, but studying their magnetization dynamics can be a challenge The performance of magnetic storage and memory devices depends on the magnetization dynamics of nanometer-scale magnetic elements called nanomagnets. Researchers at UC Santa Cruz have developed a new optical technique that enables efficient analysis of single nanomagnets as small as 75 nanometers in diameter, enabling them to extract critical information for optimizing device performance. “It’s a much more efficient method to get critical device parameters for magnetic memory and other applications,” said electrical engineer Holger Schmidt, the Kapany Professor of Optoelectronics at UC Santa Cruz. Schmidt and first author Wei-Gang Yang, a postdoctoral researcher in his lab, reported their results in a paper published in Applied Physics Letters as the cover article of the May 26 issue. The traditional optical technique Schmidt’s lab has employed to study these materials uses a short laser pulse to knock the nanomagnet out of its equilibrium state, which allows researchers to extract information about the magnet’s properties as it returns to its normal state. With smaller nanomagnets, however, this approach becomes very inefficient as the optical signal is reduced and more difficult to pick up."</em> <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/06/nanomagnets.html">[...]</a>

These include searches for rare transformations of the Higgs boson into a Z boson – which is a carrier of one of the fundamental forces of nature – and a second particle. Observing and studying transformations that are predicted to be rare helps advance our understanding of particle physics and could also point the way to new physics if observations differ from the predictions. The results also included searches for signs of Higgs transformations into “invisible” particles, which could shine light on potential dark-matter particles. The analyses involved nearly 140 inverse femtobarns of data, or around 10 million billion proton–proton collisions, recorded between 2015 and 2018. The ATLAS and CMS detectors can never see a Higgs boson directly: an ephemeral particle, it transforms (or “decays”) into lighter particles almost immediately after being produced in proton–proton collisions, and the lighter particles leave telltale signatures in the detectors."</em> <a href="https://home.cern/news/news/physics/exploring-new-ways-see-higgs-boson">[...]</a>

Nanocrystals have a wide range of existing and potential uses, but they are often made with wet chemical methods that present challenges when seeking to incorporate them effectively into devices. However, researchers from Exciton Science have demonstrated a highly efficient and controllable method to assemble single nanoparticles directly into a pre-patterned template. They have shared the details of this technique in an article published in the journal Advanced Materials that reviews the state of the field and summarises their novel approach. By applying an electric field at a certain level of strength, a technique called electrophoretic deposition (EPD), researchers at the University of Melbourne and Australia’s national science agency, CSIRO, were able to create a nearly perfect single nanocrystal array using either gold nanospheres or gold nanorods. And by tweaking the potential applied to the materials as part of this field, the researchers even discovered they were able to dictate whether the nanocrystals assemble in vertical or horizontal configurations."</em> <a href="https://excitonscience.com/news/solar-cells-phone-displays-lighting-could-be-transformed-nanocrystal-assembly-method">[...]</a>

<p><em>"There has been a resurgence recently in BBSing. While the days of phone lines are long gone, more and more BBS's are popping up - some new, some returning from dusty backup media. Without phones and modems, these "modern" BBS's are reachable over the Internet via a telnet connection. Obviously, the best way to connect to a BBS is through an (at least loosely) era-appropriate system and a serial communications program. There are several purpose-built devices out there that emulate a modem command set for just this purpose - the WiModem232 from cbmstuff.com being one of the more recent additions. If you are looking for an out of the box option for some retro BBSing, you can't go wrong with this device."</em> <a href="http://podsix.org/articles/pimodem/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"TinyUPS is a simple 5V/2.5A uninterruptible power supply with a li-ion battery as a buffer, a load sharing power path management system and an ATtiny13 for monitoring power supply and battery charge level as well as for communication with the connected device. If external power is connected to the tinyUPS the input voltage or vcc of the ATtiny13 is delivered by this source, otherwise by the battery. The ATtiny13 monitors the input voltage and tells the connected device to shutdown by pulling the SHUTDOWN-line low when the input voltage falls below a certain threshold (SHUTDOWNLEVEL). This happens when the external power source is diconnected or disabled and the battery level falls below this threshold. After waiting a certain time (SHUTDOWNTIMER) to allow the connected device to safely shut down, the ATtiny13 deactivates the boost converter and turns off the power to the connected device. If the input voltage rises again above a certain threshold (POWERONLEVEL) it activates the boost converter and turns on the power to the connected device."</em> <a href="https://github.com/wagiminator/ATtiny13-TinyUPS">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/ATMEGA328P-FUSE-RESET/">Atmega328P Fuse Reset</a></h2>

<p><em>"Instruction Manual PDF has all the necessarily files and schematics for the build. Introduction This project uses the Arduino Nano Microcontroller to reset Fuse bytes and erase Flash and EEPROM for ATMEGA 328/328P. By using the Arduino Nano with a BJT, this device will reset the Flash Program memory, EEPROM Data memory, Memory Lock bits, and Fuse bits in the ATMEGA 328/328P using HIGH VOLTAGE PARALLEL PROGRAMMING. Instructions Insert ATMEGA328/328P as shown Connect 12V Power Ready when GREEN LED stops flashing DISCONNECT POWER to avoid frying the Arduino Nano Notes DISCONNECT POWER WHEN UNUSED. For unknown reasons, the voltage regulator on the Arduino Nano (even the original one) heats up and could damage the Nano. This project is targeted for students who are learning to program their ATMEGA chips."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/ATMEGA328P-FUSE-RESET/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The timer is a tool often used in both industrial and household activities. This assembly is cheap and easy to make. It is also very versatile, being able to load a program chosen according to needs. There are several programs written by me, for Arduino Nano. The duration of the timer can be entered on the display (1602) from the rotary encoder. By pressing the button on the rotary encoder the timer is triggered.The load will be powered during the time delay via the contacts of a relay."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Timer-With-Arduino-and-Rotary-Encoder/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Few months ago, a friend of mine gave me a couple of discarded inkjet printers and copy machines. I was interested in harvesting their power source units, cables, sensors and especially motors. I salvaged what I could and I wanted to test all the parts to make sure they were functional. Some motors were rated at 12V, some at 5V, some were stepper and others were DC motors. If only I had a device, where I could simply connect the motor, set the frequency, duty cycle and select a stepping method to test it. I decided to build it without using digital signal processor, or microcontroller."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/DC-and-Stepper-Motor-Tester/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This is an Instructable about a mini oscilloscope I made, it isn't anywhere near as capable as a real (digital) oscilloscope (such as my Rigol) but I think it is nice to have. Even more important, I enjoy making things, even when they have no real use. For an example of that, just look at my "tuning fork oscillator". Browsing the internet I came across some simple diy oscilloscopes, usually made with an Arduino or Arduino compatible board but almost always with the Arduino software. The trouble with these is that an Arduino isn't very fast, its ADC isn't either and the Arduino software certainly isn't known for its speed. So some people added a separate ADC to it, which increases the hardware complexity and the total price."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Mini-Oscilloscope/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Outside the Science Centre in my city there is a large metal structure which could turn and point at where the planets were in the sky. I never saw it working, but I always thought it would be magical to know where these unreachable other worlds actually were in relation to my tiny self. When I walked past this long-dead exhibit recently I thought "I bet I could make that" and so I did! This is a guide on how to make the Planet Finder (featuring the Moon) so you too can know where to look when you're feeling awed by space.
