<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1844, o físico austríaco <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Boltzmann">Ludwig Boltzmann</a>. Foi o fundador da mecânica estatística. As suas teorias interligavam as propriedades e o comportamento de átomos e moléculas com as propriedades e o comportamento em larga escala das substâncias das quais eles eram os blocos constituintes. Ele também elaborou uma teoria cinética dos gases e a lei de Stefan-Boltzmann relativa a uma relação entre a temperatura dum corpo e a radiação que ele emite.</p>

<p>Também faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1931, o matemático norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Milnor">John Milnor</a>. Recebeu a medalha Fields em 1962 por ter provado que uma esfera de 7 dimensões pode ter 28 estruturas diferenciais diferentes. Este trabalho abriu o novo campo de topologia diferencial. O teorema de Milnor mostra que a curvatura total de um nó é de pelo menos 4. Na década de 1950, Milnor fez uma quantidade substancial de trabalho em topologia algébrica, na qual construiu o espaço de classificação de um grupo topológico e deu uma realização geométrica de uma semi-simplicidade. complexo.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1945, o astrofísico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Smoot">George Smoot</a>. Ele estudou o fundo cósmico de micro-ondas e descobriu a assinatura das ondas gravitacionais. Estas ondulações no espaço-tempo foram preditas pela primeira vez por Albert Einstein. Eles vêm dos primeiros momentos do cosmos e fornecem a primeira evidência directa da expansão após a criação do universo pelo Big Bang. Smoot liderou uma equipa de investigação para mapear os estágios iniciais do cosmos, descobrindo um padrão de variações minúsculas de temperatura que evoluíram para o universo agora formado. Ele partilhou o Prémio Nobel de Física de 2006 com John C. Mather "pela descoberta da forma do corpo negro e pela anisotropia da radiação cósmica de fundo em micro-ondas".</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que a SpaceX lançou mais um conjunto de 60 satélites para o espaço. Estes fazem parte da rede de satélites de comunicação Starlink. Infelizmente após o lançamento bem-sucedido, o primeiro estágio do foguetão não conseguiu pousar no drone Ship "Of Course I Still Love You" no Oceano Atlântico. Se tivesse sido bem sucedido, teria sido um marco importante para a empresa: 50 recuperações de foguetões. Esta missão da Starlink foi o 80º lançamento da SpaceX.</p>

<p>Também esta semana o veículo lunar Yutu-2 da China descobriu o que parecem ser rochas relativamente jovens durante suas recentes actividades de exploração no lado oposto da lua. O veículo espacial da missão Chang'e-4 fotografou as rochas espalhadas, aparentemente de cor mais clara. Os espécimes, que são bem diferentes daqueles já estudados pelo veículo espacial, poderiam completar as ideias da equipa sobre a história geológica e a evolução da área, chamada cratera Von Kármán.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. É apresentada a revista Hackspace Magazine Nº28 do mês de Março.</p>

<p><em>"SpaceX successfully launched another batch of 60 Starlink satellites into orbit Monday (Feb. 17), but missed a milestone rocket landing on what was the company's fourth flight of the year. Smoked billowed and flames erupted as the sooty Falcon 9 roared to life at 10:05 a.m. EST (1505 GMT), lifting off from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station here in Florida. The launch went off without a hitch following a 24-hour delay due to an issue with a valve component on the rocket's second stage. It was a foggy morning on the space coast, but the fog cleared just before liftoff and the Falcon 9's nine Merlin 1D engines lit up the morning sky as the rocket climbed towards orbit. The satellites rode into space atop a veteran Falcon 9 first stage, marking the fourth time the company has flown a booster four times. The booster, dubbed B1056.4 by SpaceX, previously launched two commercial resupply missions (CRS-17 in May 2019 and CRS-18 that July) followed by the massive telecommunications satellite JCSAT-18/Kacific1 in December."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-starlink-4-launch-success-misses-rocket-landing.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"China's Yutu-2 lunar rover has discovered what appear to be relatively young rocks during its recent exploration activities on the lunar far side. The Chang'e-4 mission's rover imaged the scattered, apparently lighter-colored rocks during lunar day 13 of the mission, in December 2019, according to the Chinese-language 'Our Space' science outreach blog. The specimens, which are quite different from those already studied by the rover, could round out the team's insights into the geologic history and evolution of the area, called Von Kármán crater. Closer inspection of the rocks by the rover team revealed little erosion, which on the moon is caused by micrometeorites and the huge changes in temperature across long lunar days and nights. That anomaly suggests that the fragments are relatively young. Over time, rocks tend to erode into soils."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/china-chang-e-4-moon-rover-finds-young-rocks.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Virgin Galactic has successfully completed another vital step on its path to commercial service, relocating SpaceShipTwo, VSS Unity, to its commercial headquarters at Spaceport America’s Gateway to Space building. VSS Unity, attached to the carrier aircraft, VMS Eve, made the journey from Mojave, California, where the Company’s manufacturing facilities are based. The vehicle landed at 15:49MT, where it was greeted by an enthusiastic group of teammates who will operate the spaceship in New Mexico. This captive carry flight provided an opportunity for engineers to evaluate VSS Unity for over three hours at high altitude and cold temperatures, a longer period of time than is experienced during missions to space. These environmental evaluations of system performance are difficult to replicate at ground level, making captive carry missions a vital component of VSS Unity’s flight test plan. The flight also provided a valuable opportunity to conduct pilot training and familiarization, with veteran Italian Air Force Test Pilot Nicola ‘Stick’ Pecile joining Chief Pilot Dave ‘Mac’ Mackay in the cockpit of the spaceship for the first time."</em> <a href="https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-welcomes-spaceshiptwo-unity-to-spaceport-america-new-mexico/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Intel Labs, in collaboration with QuTech ‑ a partnership between TU Delft and TNO (Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research) ‑ outlines key technical features of its new cryogenic quantum control chip “Horse Ridge” in a research paper released at the 2020 International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC) in San Francisco. The paper unveils key technical capabilities of Horse Ridge that address fundamental challenges in building a quantum system powerful enough to demonstrate quantum practicality: scalability, flexibility and fidelity. “Today, quantum researchers work with just a small number of qubits, using smaller, custom-designed systems surrounded by complex control and interconnect mechanisms. Intel’s Horse Ridge greatly minimizes this complexity. By systematically working to scale to thousands of qubits required for quantum practicality, we’re continuing to make steady progress toward making commercially viable quantum computing a reality in our future.” –Jim Clarke, director of quantum hardware, Intel Labs Why It’s Important: The quantum research community is at mile one of a marathon toward demonstrating quantum practicality. Applying quantum computing to practical problems hinges on the ability to scale to, and control, thousands of qubits at the same time with high levels of fidelity."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news/intel-qutech-unveil-details-first-cryogenic-quantum-computing-control-chip-horse-ridge/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Johns Hopkins mechanical engineers design a snake robot based on the climbing technique of the kingsnake that could help advance search-and-rescue technology Snakes live in diverse environments ranging from unbearably hot deserts to lush tropical forests. But regardless of their habitat, they are able to slither up trees, rocks, and shrubbery with ease. By studying how the creatures move, a team of Johns Hopkins engineers have created a snake robot that can nimbly and stably climb large steps. The team's new findings, published in Journal of Experimental Biology and Royal Society Open Science, could advance the creation of search and rescue robots that can successfully navigate treacherous terrain. "We look to these creepy creatures for movement inspiration because they're already so adept at stably scaling obstacles in their day-to-day lives," says Chen Li, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Johns Hopkins University and the papers' senior author.

Such systems could potentially serve off-grid arid coastal areas to provide an efficient, low-cost water source. The system uses multiple layers of flat solar evaporators and condensers, lined up in a vertical array and topped with transparent aerogel insulation. It is described in a paper appearing today in the journal Energy and Environmental Science, authored by MIT doctoral students Lenan Zhang and Lin Zhao, postdoc Zhenyuan Xu, professor of mechanical engineering and department head Evelyn Wang, and eight others at MIT and at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China. The key to the system’s efficiency lies in the way it uses each of the multiple stages to desalinate the water."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2020/passive-solar-powered-water-desalination-0207">[...]</a>

In 1666, Isaac Newton laid out his three laws of motion, still recited by physics students around the world: An object will remain in a state of inertia unless acted upon by force. The relationship between acceleration and applied force is F=ma (force equals mass times acceleration). For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.

Values are sent to ThingSpeak To help city councils or another government institutions my students have created a system that send different information about the public waste bins. This is a prototype. This system send periodically information to ThingSpeak about: Temperature Humidity Level of trash Fire Quality of the air In function of these values actions can be done. For example, if the trash is full or the quality of air is poor would be interesting to send the trash truck to pick the same."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/OscarF10/iot-intelligent-waste-management-d41711">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The Shield is an adapter allowing Arduino Nano form factor microcontrollers to be plugged into Feather form factor sockets. Hello everyone, I have a lot of time not to write anything in Hackster.io, so today I will share how you create the Arduino Nano adapter for the Adafruit Feather form factor. A few months ago, I received a gift from David Cuartielles of Arduino, the MKR1010 and Nano 33 IoT boards, the latter I loved, so I bought the Nano 33 BLE Sense version, playing with them, remember that for the Talent Land 2019 event, I bought an Adafruit TFT screen for use with the Feather boards, and there was born my idea of creating an adapter that allowed the use of the Feather ecosystem with the Arduino Nano boards.

<p><em>"A system to monitor and display the sensor data and weather forecasts. Often when designing Data acquisition systems, such as plant health monitoring in which case, the sensors are placed on-site, knowing the weather conditions may help in predicting the behaviour of other data and changes in physical requirements, if any. The project involves the design of an IoT based solution to monitor the data obtained from the sensors as well as weather forecasts predicted for a particular region. This could help in connecting multiple sensors to a system and obtaining the data on a central display. The system consists of a transmitter and a receiver section. A device runs the script to control the data being displayed at the end of the receiver sub-system."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/pankajpatro703/iot-based-sensor-climate-monitoring-using-boltiot-platform-748e38">[...]</a>

<p><em>"I bought a wood lathe a few months ago and I thought it would be fun to make my own digital readout. A digital readout is simply an electronic display that shows you the spindle speed of a lathe. I’m not very knowledgeable when it comes to wood lathes, but out of the ones I found not very many had a DRO for the spindle RPM. I started brainstorming different ways to measure the rotation of the spindle and I decided that a hall effect sensor would be the best way to go. A hall effect sensor is really just a device that can measure the presence of a magnetic field. My plan was to place a neodymium magnet on the rotating spindle then use a hall effect sensor to measure that magnetic field every time it passed by."</em> <a href="https://www.bytesizedengineering.com/projects/wood-lathe-digital-readout">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Actual PWM duty cycle on 7-segment LED display, driven by hardware (PL) and controlled by software (PS). This project was created for the MiniZed Motor Control Build Challenge and the final application was built on the Mini But Mighty project by Adam Taylor. This project is a VHDL reference design for creating a multiplexed 7-segment display hardware driver in programmable logic, and shows how to to use and test HDL hardware modules on small boards (such as MiniZed) without numerous buttons/switches and LEDs. The example presents the implementation of the created VHDL hardware module into Mini But Mighty project for displaying actual PWM duty cycle on 7-segment display. Hardware For the needs of this project, I created a hand made PCB for the 5641AS quad digit 7-segment LED display. The segments line are connected to header through 300 ohms resistors, the common cathodes of each display are driven by 2N7000 N-MOS transistors whose gates are connected to header by 10 k ohm resistors and grounded by 220 k ohm resistors."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/19adam90/7-segment-led-display-hardware-and-vhdl-module-for-minized-572dd2">[...]</a>
