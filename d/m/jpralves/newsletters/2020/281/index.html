<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1826, o matemático alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann">Bernhard Riemann</a>. O seu trabalho influenciou amplamente a geometria e a análise. Além disso, as suas ideias sobre a geometria do espaço tiveram um efeito profundo no desenvolvimento da física teórica moderna e forneceram a base para os conceitos e métodos usados posteriormente na teoria da relatividade. Ele esclareceu a noção de integral definindo o que agora chamamos de integral de Riemann. Ele foi um pensador original e uma série de métodos, teoremas e conceitos têm o seu nome.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1854, o inventor e fabricante de automóveis escocês-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Dunbar_Buick">David Dunbar Buick</a>. Ele inventou o motor mais potente com válvula na cabeça e o pára-brisa. Sem perspicácia para os negócios, ele foi fabricante por apenas alguns anos, mas a marca Buick permaneceu depois do seu negócio ter sido  adquirido por seus financiadores. Buick tinha começado (1884) no negócio de produção de tubagens e desenvolvido um método para ligar o esmalte ao ferro na produção de banheiras e pias. Em 1899, ele fez motores de combustão interna, o que levou à formação da Buick Manufacturing Company (1902) para fabricar automóveis.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1857, pioneiro teórico do espaço russo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantin_Tsiolkovsky">Konstantin Tsiolkovsky</a>. Ele enquanto professor de uma escola russa de província, elaborou muitos dos princípios da viagem espacial. Em 1883, ele observou que um veículo no espaço viajaria na direcção oposta ao gás que emitia, e foi o primeiro a propor seriamente esse método de propulsão nas viagens espaciais. Ele escreveu vários artigos, incluindo o artigo de 1903 “Exploração do Espaço com Dispositivos Reactivos”. As equações de engenharia que ele derivou incluíam parâmetros como impulso específico, coeficiente de impulso e razão de área. Ele estabeleceu que a combinação química mais eficiente seria a de hidrogénio líquido e oxigénio líquido. Mais tarde, ele foi reconhecido pela União Soviética como o "pai da cosmonautica". Ele também construiu o primeiro túnel de vento.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1916, o engenheiro electrotécnico americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswald_Garrison_Villard_Jr.">Oswald Garrison Villard Jr.</a>. Ele foi responsável pelo desenvolvimento de um radar além do horizonte (uma maneira de detectar objectos fora da visão directa ao ressaltar o radar da ionosfera, uma camada electricamente carregada na atmosfera superior) para que o radar pudesse observar a curvatura da Terra para detectar aeronaves e mísseis a milhares de quilómetros de distância. O seu interesse em electricidade começou com um exemplar do livro Harper's Electricity Book for Boys. Aos 12 anos, ele montou um rádio de um kit. Durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial, ele pesquisou contra-medidas para proteger as forças aliadas contra dispositivos de rádio e radar inimigos. Ele fez estudos pioneiros de bloqueio de radar. Em 1947, ele projectou um transmissor de voz simplificado, permitindo a comunicação bidireccional num único canal de rádio, como uma conversa telefónica.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou foi notícia o acordo entre a NVIDIA e o Softbank para a aquisição da ARM por uma quantia de 40 mil milhões de dólares. A combinação reúne a plataforma de computação IA líder da NVIDIA com o vasto ecossistema da ARM para criar a principal empresa de computação para a era da inteligência artificial, acelerando a inovação enquanto se expande para grandes mercados e de alto crescimento. O SoftBank permanecerá comprometida com o sucesso de longo prazo da ARM por meio de sua participação na NVIDIA, que deve ser inferior a 10 por cento.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos assim como projetos de maker. É apresentado também um livro sobre x86-64 Assembly Language Programming com Ubuntu.</p>

<p><em>"Compact chips boast industry’s smallest pixel size, allowing sleeker designs and minimized camera bumps The new 0.7μm lineup will adopt enhanced pixel technology with boosted light sensitivity, ISOCELL 2.0, later this year Samsung Electronics, a world leader in advanced semiconductor technology, today introduced four new Samsung ISOCELL image sensors for its 0.7 micrometer (μm)-pixel product lineup; 108-megapixel (Mp) ISOCELL HM2, 64Mp ISOCELL GW3, 48Mp ISOCELL GM5 and 32Mp ISOCELL JD1. With the new 0.7μm ISOCELL technology, Samsung plans to expand the ultra-high-resolution offerings to mainstream smartphones. “Samsung continues to pioneer innovations, such as ISOCELL Plus and Smart ISO, to deliver more pixels in a smaller package,” said Yongin Park, executive vice president of the sensor business at Samsung Electronics. “Last year, Samsung introduced the industry’s first 0.7μm-pixel image sensor and the first 108Mp sensors. Now we are bringing more of the advanced pixel technologies to mobile cameras in a variety of options that will enable high-resolution images and sleeker designs in a wider selection of tomorrow’s mobile devices.” For ultra-high-resolution image sensors, even a mere 0.1μm-difference per pixel can have a significant impact on the overall size of the sensor as well as the height of the camera module. With pixels at 0.7μm, Samsung’s newest image sensors are up to 15-percent smaller than the 0.8μm sensors of the same resolution and reduce the height of the camera module by up to 10 percent."</em> <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-expands-advanced-0-7%ce%bcm-pixel-isocell-image-sensor-offerings-for-wider-mobile-applications">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://news.microsoft.com/innovation-stories/project-natick-underwater-datacenter/">Microsoft finds underwater datacenters are reliable, practical and use energy sustainably</a></h2>

<p><em>"Earlier this summer, marine specialists reeled up a shipping-container-size datacenter coated in algae, barnacles and sea anemones from the seafloor off Scotland’s Orkney Islands. The retrieval launched the final phase of a years-long effort that proved the concept of underwater datacenters is feasible, as well as logistically, environmentally and economically practical. Microsoft’s Project Natick team deployed the Northern Isles datacenter 117 feet deep to the seafloor in spring 2018. For the next two years, team members tested and monitored the performance and reliability of the datacenter’s servers. The team hypothesized that a sealed container on the ocean floor could provide ways to improve the overall reliability of datacenters. On land, corrosion from oxygen and humidity, temperature fluctuations and bumps and jostles from people who replace broken components are all variables that can contribute to equipment failure."</em> <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/innovation-stories/project-natick-underwater-datacenter/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The violent events leading up to the death of a star would likely drive away any planets. The newly discovered Jupiter-size object may have arrived long after the star died. An international team of astronomers using NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and retired Spitzer Space Telescope has reported what may be the first intact planet found closely orbiting a white dwarf, the dense leftover of a Sun-like star, only 40% larger than Earth. The Jupiter-size object, called WD 1856 b, is about seven times larger than the white dwarf, named WD 1856+534. It circles this stellar cinder every 34 hours, more than 60 times faster than Mercury orbits our Sun. "WD 1856 b somehow got very close to its white dwarf and managed to stay in one piece," said Andrew Vanderburg, an assistant professor of astronomy at the University of Wisconsin-Madison."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7746">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A Swedish consortium including ship design firm Wallenius Marine has unveiled a modern-day sailing ship which will be capable of carrying 6-7,000 vehicles and be able to reduce emissions for the trans-Atlantic crossing by 90%. The wPCC – wind Powered Car Carrier – is a Swedish collaborative project led and overseen by Wallenius Marine and including the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, and maritime consulting firm SSPA. Heralded as a “Swedish project for truly sustainable shipping,” the wPCC is currently being developed by the consortium and is expected to be sailing by the end of 2024. The world’s largest sailing vessel, the wPCC is billed as being able to reduce emissions by 90% as compared to other ocean-going freighters. A transatlantic crossing aboard the wPCC would take twelve days, instead of the current seven days it takes a conventional freighter. Conversely, the current fleet of around 450 large car transporters currently use 40 tonnes of fossil fuel per day, opening the door for significant reductions to shipping emissions."</em> <a href="https://thedriven.io/2020/09/10/swedish-consortium-unveils-mammoth-wind-powered-car-carrier/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The Mbed team are pleased to announce the release of Mbed OS 6.3 today. This release includes features and examples covering; Cloud connectivity WiSUN BLE Over the past few months, we have begun to release our work to extend cloud service support in Mbed OS, initially by adding an integration with the Amazon Web Services SDK, which we released as part of Mbed 6.0 back in June. We firmly believe that providing examples of how to use Mbed OS with different cloud service providers gives developers using Mbed more choices when it comes to developing their IoT products and so today we’re pleased to release two further cloud service integrations; Microsoft Azure IoT Google Cloud IoT You can find out more about these integrations, and see an example of how to use them here Wi-SUN is a meshing network technology being adopted in smart city and smart metering use cases. Mbed OS first introduced Wi-SUN support in our 5.12 release and we’ve subsequently been adding new features as the technology is becoming more widely adopted. In Mbed OS 6.3 we’ve added new functionality to support setting up and securing a Wi-SUN Border Router. As we’ve mentioned before, we are also in the process of tidying up the Mbed directory structure as part of the development of the new build tools we’re working on, so further changes to that structure are included in this release."</em> <a href="https://os.mbed.com/blog/entry/Mbed-OS-63-released-today/">[...]</a>

During a media event on Tuesday, experts from NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) discussed their analysis and predictions about the new solar cycle – and how the coming upswing in space weather will impact our lives and technology on Earth, as well as astronauts in space. The Solar Cycle 25 Prediction Panel, an international group of experts co-sponsored by NASA and NOAA, announced that solar minimum occurred in December 2019, marking the start of a new solar cycle. Because our Sun is so variable, it can take months after the fact to declare this event. Scientists use sunspots to track solar cycle progress; the dark blotches on the Sun are associated with solar activity, often as the origins for giant explosions – such as solar flares or coronal mass ejections – which can spew light, energy, and solar material into space. “As we emerge from solar minimum and approach Cycle 25’s maximum, it is important to remember solar activity never stops; it changes form as the pendulum swings,” said Lika Guhathakurta, solar scientist at the Heliophysics Division at NASA Headquarters in Washington."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/solar-cycle-25-is-here-nasa-noaa-scientists-explain-what-that-means/">[...]</a>

A team of astronomers announced today (Sept. 14) that it has spotted the chemical fingerprint of phosphine, which scientists have suggested may be tied to life, in the clouds of the second rock from the sun.

<h2><a href="https://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pNid=99&amp;pOid=61675">Single photons from a silicon chip</a></h2>

<p><em>"Quantum technology holds great promise: Just a few years from now, quantum computers are expected to revolutionize database searches, AI systems, and computational simulations. Today already, quantum cryptography can guarantee absolutely secure data transfer, albeit with limitations. The greatest possible compatibility with our current silicon-based electronics will be a key advantage. And that is precisely where physicists from the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR) and TU Dresden have made remarkable progress: The team has designed a silicon-based light source to generate single photons that propagate well in glass fibers (DOI: 10.1364/OE.397377). Quantum technology relies on the ability to control the behavior of quantum particles as precisely as possible, for example by locking individual atoms in magnetic traps or by sending individual light particles – called photons – through glass fibers. The latter is the basis of quantum cryptography, a communication method that is, in principle, tap-proof: Any would-be data thief intercepting the photons unavoidably destroys their quantum properties."</em> <a href="https://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pNid=99&amp;pOid=61675">[...]</a>

This way, through code it could be possible to determine the dew temperature. On average use, determining dew temperature is not really necessary, however if for example some paint job needs to be done, determining the dew temperature is important. The surface temperature should be some 3C (5F) above dew temperature to avoid the formation of a moisture film between the coating and the base that could compromise the quality of the paint job. For this, in a single instrument it is posible to sense the surface temperature contactless, and at the same time determine if the site conditions are appropriate for the job."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Thermo-hygrometer/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"When the pandemic started, I decided that I needed to ensure that I kept myself occupied during lock down, so I mentioned to my parents that I was thinking about restarting my childhood hobby of electronics. As soon as I mentioned this, my mother said “Would you build us a Cribbage Board?”. When I asked why, she explained that they (my parents) are getting older and they lose count and where they are on the wooden board they use and this causes arguments when playing. The scene was set for my first project. To understand the project, you need to know about the game Cribbage. Cribbage is a card game, where players score points based on hands, just like Poker."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/ccooper/digi-crib-a-digital-cribbage-board-cfc18c">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Earlier this year we released designs for the Engravinator and while designing that, I caught the CNC bug… hard. I’ve been using all sorts of CNC-type machines for years, of course, already owning multiple 3D printers, lasers, and CNC routers. What I mean is the bug for building my own. The Engravinator is a great little machine and that’s what it’s designed to be. Small. But I quickly wanted to be able to work with much larger material and have a level of flexibility that the Engravinator just did not afford."</em> <a href="https://maniacallabs.com/2020/09/03/cyberplotter/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A springless animatronic tentacle mechanism that can move in all directions and is strong enough to pick things up. Why because I can. When has a lack of good reasons ever stopped anyone. Also, the original spark for this project was this hackaday article. In this article the construction of a cable driven animatronic tentacle mechanism was described. While this construction used has been known for decades, and the article gave a great example, I was captivated by an idea."</em> <a href="https://ytec3d.com/animatronic-tentacle/">[...]</a>
