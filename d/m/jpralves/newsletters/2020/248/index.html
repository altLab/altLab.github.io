<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia o engenheiro electrotécnico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart">Douglas Engelbart</a>. Nascido em 1925, ele foi o inventor do rato de computador. Adicionalmente ele também colaborou na invenção de outros dispositivos de "input" como o joystick, a track-ball e a light pen.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou o Kernel de Linux 5.5 foi lançado oficialmente. Com a designação de código Kleptomaniac Octopus”, esta nova versão foi lançada por Linus Torvalds de acordo com o calendário. De entre as novidades destacam-se o suporte para o Raspberry Pi 4, overclocking da GPU AMD Navi, suporte para futuras plataformas da Intel, paginação de nivel 5 por omissão, driver NVMe com nova interface, suporte de voz para o Chromebook, melhoramentos ao nível do filesystem ext4 e btrfs, etc.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que o rover Curiosity já recuperou do problema que teve à duas semanas podendo dar continuidade às experiências cientificas que estava a fazer.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. São apresentadas as revistas MagPi Nº90 de Fevereiro e newelectronics de 28 Janeiro 2020.</p>

<p><em>"Linus Torvalds has officially released Linux kernel 5.5 according to the original schedule, despite the delays that were expected due to the Christmas and New Year’s holidays. Codenamed Kleptomaniac Octopus, the new Linux release comes with a series of major improvements, including full Raspberry Pi 4 and Chromebook Wake-On-Voice support. “Despite the slight worry that the holidays might have affected the schedule, 5.5 ended up with the regular rc cadence and is out now,” Linus Torvalds announced. Furthermore, the new Linux kernel introduces AMD GPU overclocking, which is one of the most anticipated improvements especially as Linux is pushing harder in the gaming ecosystem, as well as full support for the newly-released and the upcoming Intel chipsets. Linux 5.6 on its way There are additional improvements for virtual machines running on Microsoft Hyper-V, as the platform now supports hibernating as well. And of course, the Linux kernel comes with a series of file system changes, including for XFS, exFAT, and ext4."</em> <a href="https://news.softpedia.com/news/linux-5-5-kleptomaniac-octopus-officially-launched-528989.shtml">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.space.com/mars-rover-curiosity-attitude-glitch.html">NASA's Mars rover Curiosity had an attitude problem. (But it's fine now.)</a></h2>

<p><em>"Curiosity has bounced back from numerous glitches during its long and accomplished mission. An attitude problem sidelined NASA's Mars rover Curiosity recently, but the robot's handlers whipped it back into shape in short order. "Partway through its last set of activities, Curiosity lost its orientation. Some knowledge of its attitude was not quite right, so it couldn't make the essential safety evaluation," Curiosity team member Dawn Sumner, a planetary geologist at the University of California, Davis, wrote in a mission update on Monday (Jan. 20). "Attitude" in this case refers to Curiosity's position in space, and the position of its various parts, such as its instrument-laden robotic arm. Losing attitude knowledge could result in some pretty bad outcomes — for example, bonking that robotic arm into something or mistakenly pointing a camera at the sun, Sumner explained."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/mars-rover-curiosity-attitude-glitch.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Toshiba Electronic Devices &amp; Storage Corporation (“Toshiba”) has launched “TLP2363,” a 10Mbps high-speed communication logic output photocoupler for 24V digital input interfaces of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). Shipments start today. The new photocoupler’s specifications include both the minimum and maximum values of its threshold input current at its operating temperature range (-40 to 105℃). Use of the photocoupler in combination with appropriate resistors for current control realizes a 24V digital input module that follows IEC 61131-2 Type 1[1] specifications. In addition, the new product’s circuit suppresses chattering noise so that its output is clearly either “low” or “high,” even with a slow input signal with a long (60s or less) rise or fall time. This eliminates the need for a waveform shaping circuit in the output part, reducing the number of components."</em> <a href="https://toshiba.semicon-storage.com/ap-en/company/news/news-topics/2020/01/opto-20200128-1.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"After more than 16 years studying the universe in infrared light, revealing new wonders in our solar system, our galaxy and beyond, NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope's mission has come to an end. Mission engineers confirmed at about 2:30 p.m. PDT (5:30 p.m. EDT) Thursday the spacecraft was placed in safe mode, ceasing all science operations. After the decommissioning was confirmed, Spitzer Project Manager Joseph Hunt declared the mission had officially ended. Launched in 2003, Spitzer was one of NASA's four Great Observatories, along with the Hubble Space Telescope, the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. The Great Observatories program demonstrated the power of using different wavelengths of light to create a fuller picture of the universe. "Spitzer has taught us about entirely new aspects of the cosmos and taken us many steps further in understanding how the universe works, addressing questions about our origins, and whether or not are we alone," said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7588">[...]</a>

<p><em>"As car security systems become increasingly more sophisticated, thieves are targeting car parts instead, including alloy wheels. One method to deter wheel thieves is to use locking nuts, one on each wheel, which require a special adapter, or key, to loosen. But even these are not invulnerable. Our engineers have now developed unique locking wheel nuts using 3D printing technology. Together with EOS, a leading supplier for high-end solutions in additive manufacturing, we have created locking nuts with contours based on the driver’s voice. Like an iris scan or a fingerprint, a person’s voice can be used as a unique biometric identification."</em> <a href="https://fordeurope.blogspot.com/2020/01/3d-tech-helps-keep-thieves-at-bay.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI) today announced a strategic collaboration with Hyundai Motor Company (HMC) where Hyundai plans to launch the automotive industry’s first all-digital road noise cancellation system leveraging ADI’s Automotive Audio Bus (A2B®) technology. Hyundai also intends to more broadly adopt ADI’s A2B technology for its fundamental audio connectivity and infotainment applications across its automotive fleet. “As an early A2B adopter, we realized the potential of this technology for not only our Road-noise Active Noise Control (RANC) systems but also for other vehicle applications fundamental to passenger and driver experience,” said Dr. Kang-Duck Ih, Research Fellow, Hyundai. “The low latency guaranteed by A2B enabled us to implement this groundbreaking RANC technology and accelerate its deployment to mass production.” Hyundai’s RANC system dramatically reduces noise within the cabin of a vehicle. The system can analyze various types of noise in real-time and produce inverted soundwaves. For example, there are different types of road noises that the new technology can process, such as resonant sounds created between tires and wheels or rumble sounds coming up from the road."</em> <a href="https://www.analog.com/en/about-adi/news-room/press-releases/2020/01-22-2020-analog-devices-collaborates-with-hundai-motor-company-to-launch-industrys.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"SpaceX successfully launched its fourth batch of Starlink satellites into orbit and nailed a rocket landing today (Jan. 29) following days of weather delays for the mission. A sooty Falcon 9 rocket — which made its third flight with this launch — roared to life at 9:06 a.m. EST (1406 GMT), lifting off from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station here in Florida. The rocket carried 60 more Starlink satellites for SpaceX's growing constellation, the second such launch by the company this month. The satellites all successfully deployed about an hour after liftoff. Last week, strong upper level winds forced the private spaceflight company to postpone the Starlink-3 mission's launch. SpaceX then aimed for the backup launch date of Jan. 28; however, rough seas where the drone ship was waiting may have thwarted any attempt at a landing."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-starlink-3-satellites-launch-rocket-landing-success.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Physicists at LMU, together with colleagues at Saarland University, have successfully demonstrated the transport of an entangled state between an atom and a photon via an optic fiber over a distance of up to 20 km – thus setting a new record. ‘Entanglement’ describes a very particular type of quantum state which is not attributed to a single particle alone, but which is shared between two different particles. It irrevocably links their subsequent fates together – no matter how far apart they are – which famously led Albert Einstein to call the phenomenon as “spooky action at a distance”. Entanglement has become a cornerstone of new technologies based on effects at the quantum level and is distribution over long distances a central goal in quantum communication. Now LMU researchers led by physicist Harald Weinfurter, in collaboration with a team at the University of the Saarland in Saarbrücken, have shown that the entangled state of an atom and a photon can be transmitted via an optic fiber (like those used in telecommunications networks) over a distance of up to 20 km. The previous record was 700 meters."</em> <a href="http://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/news/newsarchiv/2020/weinfurter_entanglement.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Solar panel costs have dropped lately, but slimming down silicon wafers could lead to even lower costs and faster industry expansion. Costs of solar panels have plummeted over the last several years, leading to rates of solar installations far greater than most analysts had expected. But with most of the potential areas for cost savings already pushed to the extreme, further cost reductions are becoming more challenging to find. Now, researchers at MIT and at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) have outlined a pathway to slashing costs further, this time by slimming down the silicon cells themselves. Thinner silicon cells have been explored before, especially around a dozen years ago when the cost of silicon peaked because of supply shortages. But this approach suffered from some difficulties: The thin silicon wafers were too brittle and fragile, leading to unacceptable levels of losses during the manufacturing process, and they had lower efficiency."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2020/cheaper-solar-cells-thinner-0127">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Electronics are showing up everywhere: on our laps, in pockets and purses and, increasingly, snuggled up against our skin or sewed into our clothing. But the adoption of wearable electronics has so far been limited by their need to derive power from bulky, rigid batteries that reduce comfort and may present safety hazards due to chemical leakage or combustion. Now Stanford researchers have developed a soft and stretchable battery that relies on a special type of plastic to store power more safely than the flammable formulations used in conventional batteries today. “Until now we haven’t had a power source that could stretch and bend the way our bodies do, so that we can design electronics that people can comfortably wear,” said chemical engineer Zhenan Bao, who teamed up with materials scientist Yi Cui to develop the device they describe in the Nov. 26 edition of Nature Communications. The use of plastics, or polymers, in batteries is not new. For some time, lithium ion batteries have used polymers as electrolytes — the energy source that transports negative ions to the battery’s positive pole."</em> <a href="https://engineering.stanford.edu/magazine/article/new-stretchable-battery-can-power-wearable-electronics">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.cs.uchicago.edu/news/article/quantum-compression/">EPiQC Researchers Simulate 61-Bit Quantum Computer With Data Compression</a></h2>

<p><em>"When trying to debug quantum hardware and software by using a quantum simulator, every quantum bit (qubit) counts. Every simulated qubit closer to physical machine sizes halves the gap in compute power between the simulation and the physical hardware. However, the memory requirement of full-state simulation grows exponentially with the number of simulated qubits, and this limits the size of simulations that can be run. Researchers at the University of Chicago and Argonne National Laboratory significantly reduced this gap by using data compression techniques to fit a 61-qubit simulation of Grover’s quantum search algorithm on a large supercomputer with 0.4 percent error. Other quantum algorithms were also simulated with substantially more qubits and quantum gates than previous efforts. Classical simulation of quantum circuits is crucial for better understanding the operations and behaviors of quantum computation."</em> <a href="https://www.cs.uchicago.edu/news/article/quantum-compression/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Taking a cue from birds and insects, Brown University researchers have come up with a new wing design for small drones that helps them fly more efficiently and makes them more robust to atmospheric turbulence. Researchers from Brown University have designed a new type of wing that could make small fixed-wing drones far more stable and efficient. The new wing replaces the smooth contour found on the leading edges of most airplane wings with a thick flat plate and a sharp leading edge. Counterintuitive as it may seem, it turns out that the design has distinct aerodynamic advantages at the scale of small drones. In a paper published in Science Robotics, the researchers show that the new wing is far more stable than standard wings in the face of sudden wind gusts and other types of turbulence, which often wreak havoc on small aircraft. The wing also provides an aerodynamically efficient flight that translates into better battery life and longer flight times."</em> <a href="https://www.brown.edu/news/2020-01-29/wings">[...]</a>

<p><em>"High pressures have crushed hydrogen to what researchers describe as a ‘probable transition’ to its prized metallic form.1 To achieve this the scientists pushed the pressures exerted by diamond anvil cells used in these experiments up from around 400GPa to 600GPa – six million times atmospheric pressure. Paul Loubeyre and Florent Occelli from the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) worked with Paul Dumas from the Soleil synchrotron outside Paris, where they did high-brightness infrared spectroscopy studies. When they pressed hydrogen at phenomenal pressures between the tips of two diamonds, they saw a sharp change in absorption of infrared light as the material absorbed it all, consistent with a shift to a conductive metal. ‘It’s the first robust observation of the properties of hydrogen in this pressure range,’ Loubeyre tells Chemistry World. The scientists didn’t directly measure the sample’s conductivity, however, which is why they can’t absolutely claim to have produced the metallic form. Yet ‘the complete absorption in the infrared is a necessary condition for metallic hydrogen’, Loubeyre adds."</em> <a href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/metallic-hydrogen-reveals-itself-under-mounting-pressure/4011102.article">[...]</a>

The change, which entailed replacing large and slow components with small and fast ones, was a catalyst for the enduring trend of miniaturization in computer design. No such revolution has yet hit the field of infrared optics, which remains reliant on bulky moving parts that preclude building small systems. However, a team of researchers at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, together with Professor Juejun Hu and graduate students from MIT's Department of Materials Science and Engineering, is devising a way to control infrared light by using phase-change materials instead of moving parts. These materials have the ability to change their optical properties when energy is added to them."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2020/researchers-discover-new-way-control-infrared-light-0130">[...]</a>

The team’s paper, “Autonomic Perspiration in 3D Printed Hydrogel Actuators,” published Jan. 29 in Science Robotics. One of the hurdles for making enduring, adaptable and agile robots is managing the robots’ internal temperature, according to Shepherd, the paper’s senior author.

I did!...by building a miniature version of the famed Bellagio water show to be carried on a parade float. Using a Raspberry Pi to control a bunch of solenoids timed to music while a pump pushed water from a kiddie pool through some sprinkler hosing. Control Board The control board consisted of a raspberry pi connected to 9 relays. One of the relays was used to turn on the pump, and the other 8 were used to open and close the solenoids in time to the music."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/ndrogness/raspberry-pi-bellagio-water-show-b07a5c">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This is a vintage VFD tube clock that uses Ethernet for both power and data. The power is provided using 802.3at PoE+ and a Molex PD Jack that contains both integrated magnetics and a PoE Type 2 PD controller. The IP stack runs on a Microchip PIC18F67J60 microcontroller that has an integrated Ethernet MAC and PHY. The IP stack includes DHCP, DNS, NTP, and LLDP functionality. The clock powers up and receives its IP address and a DNS server address via DHCP. LLDP is used to negotiate 7.5 Watts of power."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/bikerglen/poe-powered-vfd-tube-clock-b7587f">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This project will show you how to make a Probe using a Datalogging Arduino Shield, some sensors and a RTC Clock. Functionning The Datalogger is a particular mounting which can register values coming from sensors on a support ( like an SD card ). This system can be used in many projects that need a periodical measurement ( such as probes ;) ). This probe collects values from sensors and registers them into the SD card of the datalogging shield. When you plug your SD card into your computer, you will see an excel file with sensors values onto. "</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/MisterBotBreak/how-to-make-a-probe-a3b835">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Goals of this project: Create an instrument with two button decks using a single brain, but still allow for the portability that having separate devices allows. Design a platform with interchangeable parts that can be modified or augmented without reprinting an entire case. Build in a way that allows construction without access to (or the desire to use) a large volume 3D printer for parts. To that end: The case walls, decks and panels are fastened together with wood screws rather than being printed in place. Case walls share the same width/height dimensions and could easily be swapped with 1/2" x 3" (13mm x 64mm) hobby board. Button decks and bottom panels could be constructed using flat 1/8" (3mm) wood project panels/acrylic sheets and a laser cutter/CNC machine (or some careful drill work with a step bit)."</em> <a href="https://www.koopinstruments.com/instrument-projects/harmonicade">[...]</a>

<p><em>"There is no question that ESP32 is a worthy competitor to many WiFi/MCU SoCs out there, often beating it on both performance and price. But, depending on which state it’s in, the ESP32 can be a relatively power-hungry device. When your IoT project is powered by a plug in the wall, you tend not to care too much about power consumption. But if you are going to power your project by batteries, every mA counts. The solution here is to cut back ESP32’s power usage by leveraging one of its Sleep Modes. It’s really a great strategy for dramatically extending the battery life of a project that doesn’t need to be active all the time."</em> <a href="https://lastminuteengineers.com/esp32-sleep-modes-power-consumption/">[...]</a>

If you answered yes to these questions, or you just want a fun soldering project that will yield you something useful, then this project is for you! I’m always trying to cram Raspberry Pis into different things for my projects, and a few of the latest things I’ve been working use a Pi Zero and just don’t have the space for a USB Hub/HAT. I’ve looked around online and there are sites that sell tiny USB hub boards like this, but they are pretty expensive.

Heres what I came up with: a self-setting, self-correcting, self-adjusting wall clock/chronometer that tells time both in our timekeeping system and in the 25-hour Dni timekeeping system used in the Myst series of video games. This's actually pretty handy if you want to know if its the right time to log in for certain events in Myst Online: Uru Live. Technically its more a chronometer than a clock the main difference is that chronometers have far higher accuracy &amp; precision, to the point that they can be used for scientific experiments.
