<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Gustaf_Ekeberg">Anders Gustaf Ekeberg</a>. Este químico sueco, nascido em 1767, foi responsável pela descoberta do Tântalo.
Em 1853 nascia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Michelin">André Jules Michelin</a>. Este industrial francês é o fundador da Michelin e conjuntamente com o seu irmão Édouard criaram os primeiros pneus de bicicleta e automóvel que podiam ser facilmente removidos para reparação.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que um homem que sofreu um acidente e ficou paralisado da cintura para baixo conseguiu completar a maratona graças à utilização de um exo-esqueleto. Nesta sua segunda tentativa o homem, Adam Gorlitsky, conseguiu completar a maratona em 33 horas, 50 minutos e 23 segundos.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos também a conhecer a nova tecnologia que está a ser desenvolvida pela Mojo Vision. Trata-se de uma lente de contacto com realidade aumentada incorporada. O desenho desta lente possibilita a colocação de informação sobreposta directamente junto ao olho. Trata-se ainda de um prototipo mas a ideia é bastante interessante.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker.</p>

<p><em>"A South Carolina man competing in the 2020 Charleston Marathon has beaten the world record for the fastest time to finish a marathon in an exoskeleton suit. Adam Gorlitsky, who is paralyzed from the waist down, completed Saturday's 26.2-mile race with a time of 33 hours, 50 minutes and 23 seconds, Cory Michel, one of the organizers of the Charleston Marathon, told CNN. The current record holder is British man Simon Kindleysides, who finished the 2018 London Marathon in 36 hours and 46 minutes, according to Guinness World Records. Guinness has not certified Gorlitsky's race results, which Gorlitsky said he plans to submit to the organization Monday. Gorlitsky started walking the race Thursday night and finished Saturday morning, without taking any breaks for sleep. It was Gorlitsky's second marathon attempt."</em> <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/12/us/paralyzed-man-charleston-marathon-record-trnd/index.html">[...]</a>

Only when I peeked over toward the periphery did a small yellow weather icon appear. When I examined it more closely, I could see the local temperature, the current weather, and some forecast information. I looked over to the 9 o’clock position and saw a traffic icon that gave way to a frontal graphic showing potential driving routes on a simple map. At 12 o’clock, I found my calendar and to-do information.

<h2><a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/news/all-news/2020/jan/ultrasound-3d-printing">Ultrasound can help make 3D-printed alloys stronger</a></h2>

<p><em>"Researchers have used sound vibrations to shake metal alloy grains into tighter formation during 3D printing. A new study shows high frequency sound waves can have a significant impact on the inner micro-structure of 3D printed alloys, making them more consistent and stronger than those printed conventionally. Lead author and PhD candidate from RMIT University’s School of Engineering, Carmelo Todaro, said the promising results could inspire new forms of additive manufacturing. “If you look at the microscopic structure of 3D printed alloys, they’re often made up of large and elongated crystals,” Todaro explained. “This can make them less acceptable for engineering applications due to their lower mechanical performance and increased tendency to crack during printing.” “But the microscopic structure of the alloys we applied ultrasound to during printing looked markedly different. The alloy crystals were very fine and fully equiaxed, meaning they had formed equally in all directions throughout the entire printed metal part.” Testing showed these parts were also stronger: they had a 12% improvement in tensile strength and yield stress compared to those made through conventional additive manufacturing."</em> <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/news/all-news/2020/jan/ultrasound-3d-printing">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Imagine having access to a battery, which has the potential to power your phone for five continuous days, or enable an electric vehicle to drive more than 1000km without needing to “refuel”. Monash University researchers are on the brink of commercialising the world’s most efficient lithium-sulphur (Li-S) battery, which could outperform current market leaders by more than four times, and power Australia and other global markets well into the future. Dr Mahdokht Shaibani from Monash University’s Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering led an international research team that developed an ultra-high capacity Li-S battery that has better performance and less environmental impact than current lithium-ion products. The researchers have an approved filed patent (PCT/AU 2019/051239) for their manufacturing process, and prototype cells have been successfully fabricated by German R&amp;D partners Fraunhofer Institute for Material and Beam Technology. Some of the world’s largest manufacturers of lithium batteries in China and Europe have expressed interest in upscaling production, with further testing to take place in Australia in early 2020. The study was published in Science Advances on Saturday, 4 January 2020 – the first research on Li-S batteries to feature in this prestigious international publication."</em> <a href="https://www.monash.edu/news/articles/supercharging-tomorrow-australia-first-to-test-new-lithium-batteries">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://news.mit.edu/2020/verify-quantum-chips-computing-0113">How to verify that quantum chips are computing correctly</a></h2>

<p><em>"A new method determines whether circuits are accurately executing complex operations that classical computers can’t tackle. In a step toward practical quantum computing, researchers from MIT, Google, and elsewhere have designed a system that can verify when quantum chips have accurately performed complex computations that classical computers can’t. Quantum chips perform computations using quantum bits, called “qubits,” that can represent the two states corresponding to classic binary bits — a 0 or 1 — or a “quantum superposition” of both states simultaneously. The unique superposition state can enable quantum computers to solve problems that are practically impossible for classical computers, potentially spurring breakthroughs in material design, drug discovery, and machine learning, among other applications. Full-scale quantum computers will require millions of qubits, which isn’t yet feasible. In the past few years, researchers have started developing “Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum” (NISQ) chips, which contain around 50 to 100 qubits."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2020/verify-quantum-chips-computing-0113">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.ornl.gov/news/memory-storage-super-cold-computing">Memory storage for super cold computing</a></h2>

<p><em>"Scientists at the Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory have experimentally demonstrated a novel cryogenic, or low temperature, memory cell circuit design based on coupled arrays of Josephson junctions, a technology that may be faster and more energy efficient than existing memory devices. If successfully scaled, this type of cryogenic memory array could advance a variety of applications including quantum and exascale computing. “In our design, we have attempted a fundamentally different path that employs small, inductively coupled arrays of Josephson junctions,” said Yehuda Braiman of ORNL’s Computational Sciences and Engineering Division. “If scaled, such memory cell arrays could be orders of magnitude faster than existing memories while consuming very little power.” The cells are designed to operate in super cold temperatures and were tested at just 4 Kelvin above absolute zero, about minus 452 degrees Fahrenheit. In conditions this cold, atoms slow down and certain materials lose resistance to the flow of electricity, becoming superconductors. Because superconductors have no resistance to electrical flow, they lose an almost negligible amount of energy as heat."</em> <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/news/memory-storage-super-cold-computing">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Composites made from self-assembling inorganic materials are valued for their unique strength and thermal, optical and magnetic properties. However, because self-assembly can be difficult to control, the structures formed can be highly disordered, leading to defects during large-scale production. Researchers at the University of Illinois and the University of Michigan have developed a templating technique that instills greater order and gives rise to new 3D structures in a special class of materials, called eutectics, to form new, high-performance materials. The findings of the collaborative study are published in the journal Nature. Eutectic materials contain elements and compounds that have different melting and solidification temperatures. When combined, however, the composite formed has single melting and freezing temperatures – like when salt and water combine to form brine, which freezes at a lower temperature than water or salt alone, the researchers said."</em> <a href="https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/805440">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scientists discover new neutron-detecting material for applications in science and national security. Whether you are trying to detect a possible radiation signature from a suspicious package or vehicle, or you are measuring power output in a nuclear reactor, being able to detect neutrons efficiently and precisely represents a significant challenge. Most neutron detectors work based on one of two different technologies. Some, like those based on helium, are gas-filled. Others, like those based on lithium or boron, involve scintillators that take absorbed neutrons and emit light in response. In neither case are neutrons converted to electrical current and thus a directly readable signal."</em> <a href="https://www.anl.gov/article/scientists-pioneer-new-generation-of-semiconductor-neutron-detector">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Since the invention of the transistor in 1947, computing development has seen a consistent doubling of the number of transistors that can fit on a chip. But that trend, known as Moore’s Law, may reach its limit as components of submolecular size encounter problems with thermal noise, making further scaling impossible. In their paper published this week in Applied Physics Reviews, from AIP Publishing, authors Jack Kendall, of Rain Neuromorphics, and Suhas Kumar, of Hewlett Packard Labs, present a thorough examination of the computing landscape, focusing on the operational functions needed to advance brain-inspired neuromorphic computing. Their proposed pathway includes hybrid architectures composed of digital architectures, alongside a resurgence of analog architectures, made possible by memristors, which are resistors with memory that can process information directly where it is stored. “The future of computing will not be about cramming more components on a chip but in rethinking processor architecture from the ground up to emulate how a brain efficiently processes information,” Kumar said. “Solutions have started to emerge which replicate the natural processing system of a brain, but both the research and market spaces are wide open,” Kendall added."</em> <a href="https://publishing.aip.org/publications/latest-content/reinventing-the-computer-brain-inspired-computing-for-a-post-moores-law-era/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"“Universal memory” was widely considered to be unachievable – until now Physicists at Lancaster University have demonstrated how their invention of a new type of memory device could transform the way computers, smartphones and other gadgets work. "Universal memory" is, in essence, a memory where the data is very robustly stored, but can also easily be changed; something that was widely considered to be unachievable – until now. Currently, the two main types of memory, dynamic RAM (DRAM) and flash, have complementary characteristics and roles. DRAM is fast, so used for active (working) memory but it is volatile, meaning that information is lost when power is removed. Indeed, DRAM continually ‘forgets’ and needs to be constantly refreshed. Flash is non-volatile, allowing you to carry data in your pocket, but is very slow."</em> <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/news/-universal-memory-research-passes-new-milestone">[...]</a>

With significantly increased computing power, quantum computers will be able to solve tasks that conventional computers cannot handle, such as understanding and inventing new materials or pharmaceuticals as well as testing the limits of cryptographic techniques. Like in conventional computers, the term quantum bit or qubit refers to the basic unit in quantum information. Presently, the most advanced approaches for realising them are superconducting circuits and trapped ions. The former stores quantum information in electronic components, the latter in different energy levels of single atoms. By using superconducting circuits, researchers recently succeeded in demonstrating that quantum computers are able to perform highly specialised tasks that conventional computers cannot handle."</em> <a href="https://www.uni-hannover.de/en/universitaet/aktuelles/online-aktuell/details/news/robust-operations-for-quantum-computers/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/hardware/scalable-qubits-quantum-computer-news-silicon-wafer">Building a Quantum Computer From Off-the-Shelf Parts</a></h2>

<p><em>"University of Chicago researchers develop stable and possibly scalable qubits by creating defects in commercial silicon wafers A new technique for fabricating quantum bits in silicon carbide wafers could provide a scalable platform for future quantum computers. The quantum bits, to the surprise of the researchers, can even be fabricated from a commercial chip built for conventional computing. The recipe was surprisingly simple: Buy a commercially available wafer of silicon carbide (a temperature-robust semiconductor used in electric vehicles, LED lights, solar cells, and 5G gear) and shoot an electron beam at it. The beam creates a deficiency in the wafer which behaves, essentially, as a single electron spin that can be manipulated electrically, magnetically, or optically. “It’s ironic after 50 years or so of trying to clean up semiconductors to make high-quality electronics, our plan is to put the defects back in—and use them to make a trapped atom in a semiconductor,” says David Awschalom, professor of molecular engineering at the University of Chicago. Awschalom says his group at Chicago is one of a number that have followed up on the promise of a pioneering 2011 paper by researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara—who first discovered that small defects in silicon carbide could be manipulated to become essentially room-temperature cages for individual electrons, whose spins can then be used as a quantum bit for possible computations and communications."</em> <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/hardware/scalable-qubits-quantum-computer-news-silicon-wafer">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The increased interest in IoT and electric automobiles around the world is driving an increase in the use of Lithium-Ion/Lithium-Polymer/NiCd/NiMH batteries as more devices and applications are using them, due to their high energy storage capacity to size ratio. This increased interest is, however, causing an increase in the number of batteries with “fake” ampere-hours ratings in the market. These fake ratings could lead to the failure of several projects, especially IoT projects in which developers factor in the Battery ratings in their On-time calculations. As such, to find a way of mitigating the failure-risks this problem poses, for today’s tutorial, we are going to build a battery capacity tester which can be used to get the correct energy storage capacity of any Lithium-Ion/Lithium-Polymer/NiCd/NiMH batteries (with voltage below &lt;5v).

<p><em>"A long time ago, 7400 logic was all that was available, but having only 7400 logic means designs can get big and difficult, but making a custom logic IC was expensive and hardly a possibility. A few companies started making programmable logic devices like the Programmable Logic Array (PLA) and Programmable Array Logic (PAL). These devices started being available in the 1970’s and where generally one time programmable devices, with the capability to contain a handful of simple logic. Much later, in 1985, the Generic Array Logic (GAL) came into existence, a reprogrammable version of the PAL. Later on the CPLD’s and FPGA’s came and are still used today.When reading about this I discovered there are still GAL’s made and sold, and getting old ones from Ebay is easy enough. They looked like weird odd devices, so I decided to have a closer look, eventually making a dual BCD to 7 segment decoder with them that even handled multiplexing."</em> <a href="https://justanotherelectronicsblog.com/?p=458">[...]</a>

General Information This project generates a new code every 30 seconds using a preshared key and the current time (which is kept track of using the real-time clock module) and displays it on the display when the button is pressed. The most common use case would be two-factor verification based on Time-based One Time Password (TOTP) and HMAC-based One Time Password(HOTP) for authentication. TOTP is an algorithm that computes a one-time password from a shared secret key and the current time. HTOP is an algorithm that uses the HMAC algorithm to generate a one-time password."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-TOTP-Generator/">[...]</a>
