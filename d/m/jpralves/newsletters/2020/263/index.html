<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1925 o físico teórico israelita <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuval_Ne%27eman">Yuval Ne'eman</a>. Tendo trabalhado independentemente de Gell-Mann, mas quase simultaneamente (1961), ele desenvolveu um método de agrupamento de bárions de tal maneira que eles caíram em famílias lógicas. Agora conhecido como o Caminho Óctuplo, o esquema agrupava mésons e bárions (por exemplo, protões e neutrões) em multipletos de 1, 8, 10 ou 27 membros com base em várias propriedades. Ele foi chefe da comissão de energia atómica de Israel e fundou o programa espacial do país.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que os cientistas finalmente conseguiram explicar a razão da deslocação do norte magnético da Terra. Uma equipa, liderada pela Universidade de Leeds, diz que o comportamento é explicado pela competição entre duas "bolhas" magnéticas na borda do núcleo externo da Terra. As mudanças no fluxo de material derretido no interior do planeta alteraram a força das regiões acima do fluxo magnético negativo. "Esta mudança no padrão de fluxo enfraqueceu o sistema no Canadá e aumentou levemente a força do sistema na Sibéria", explicou o Dr. Phil Livermore.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que a Tesla tem um plano para introduzir uma nova bateria de longa duração e de baixo custo no seu veiculo Modelo 3 na China no final deste ano ou no início do próximo, que espera trazer o custo dos veículos eléctricos em linha com a gasolina modelos e permitir que as baterias EV tenham uma segunda e terceira vidas na rede eléctrica. A nova bateria de "milhão de milhas" no centro da estratégia da Tesla foi desenvolvida em conjunto com a Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd da China (CATL) (300750.SZ) e implementa a tecnologia desenvolvida pela Tesla em colaboração com uma equipa de especialistas académicos em baterias recrutados por Musk.</p>

<p><em>"It's shifted in recent years away from Canada towards Siberia. And this rapid movement has required more frequent updates to navigation systems, including those that operate the mapping functions in smartphones. A team, led from Leeds University, says the behaviour is explained by the competition of two magnetic "blobs" on the edge of the Earth's outer core. Changes in the flow of molten material in the planet's interior have altered the strength of the above regions of negative magnetic flux. "This change in the pattern of flow has weakened the patch under Canada and ever so slightly increased the strength of the patch under Siberia," explained Dr Phil Livermore. "This is why the North Pole has left its historic position over the Canadian Arctic and crossed over the International Date Line."</em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/science-environment-52550973">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Electric car maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) plans to introduce a new low-cost, long-life battery in its Model 3 sedan in China later this year or early next that it expects will bring the cost of electric vehicles in line with gasoline models, and allow EV batteries to have second and third lives in the electric power grid. For months, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has been teasing investors, and rivals, with promises to reveal significant advances in battery technology during a “Battery Day” in late May. New, low-cost batteries designed to last for a million miles of use and enable electric Teslas to sell profitably for the same price or less than a gasoline vehicle are just part of Musk’s agenda, people familiar with the plans told Reuters. With a global fleet of more than 1 million electric vehicles that are capable of connecting to and sharing power with the grid, Tesla’s goal is to achieve the status of a power company, competing with such traditional energy providers as Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PCG_pa.A) and Tokyo Electric Power (9501.T), those sources said. The new “million mile” battery at the center of Tesla’s strategy was jointly developed with China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd (CATL) (300750.SZ) and deploys technology developed by Tesla in collaboration with a team of academic battery experts recruited by Musk, three people familiar with the effort said. Eventually, improved versions of the battery, with greater energy density and storage capacity and even lower cost, will be introduced in additional Tesla vehicles in other markets, including North America, the sources said."</em> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-tesla-batteries-exclusive/exclusive-teslas-secret-batteries-aim-to-rework-the-math-for-electric-cars-and-the-grid-idUSKBN22Q1WC">[...]</a>

<p><em>"GTC 2020 -- NVIDIA today announced that the first GPU based on the NVIDIA® Ampere architecture, the NVIDIA A100, is in full production and shipping to customers worldwide. The A100 draws on design breakthroughs in the NVIDIA Ampere architecture — offering the company’s largest leap in performance to date within its eight generations of GPUs — to unify AI training and inference and boost performance by up to 20x over its predecessors. A universal workload accelerator, the A100 is also built for data analytics, scientific computing and cloud graphics. “The powerful trends of cloud computing and AI are driving a tectonic shift in data center designs so that what was once a sea of CPU-only servers is now GPU-accelerated computing,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “NVIDIA A100 GPU is a 20x AI performance leap and an end-to-end machine learning accelerator — from data analytics to training to inference. For the first time, scale-up and scale-out workloads can be accelerated on one platform."</em> <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidias-new-ampere-data-center-gpu-in-full-production">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Enabling High-Speed Edge AI Processing and Contributing to Building of Optimal Systems Linked with the Cloud Sony Corporation today announced the upcoming release of two models of intelligent vision sensors, the first image sensors in the world to be equipped with AI processing functionality. *1 Including AI processing functionality on the image sensor itself enables high-speed edge AI processing and extraction of only the necessary data, which, when using cloud services, reduces data transmission latency, addresses privacy concerns, and reduces power consumption and communication costs. These products expand the opportunities to develop AI-equipped cameras, enabling a diverse range of applications in the retail and industrial equipment industries and contributing to building optimal systems that link with the cloud. The spread of IoT has resulted in all types of devices being connected to the cloud, making commonplace the use of information processing systems where information obtained from such devices is processed via AI on the cloud. On the other hand, the increasing volume of information handled in the cloud poses various problems: increased data transmission latency hindering real-time information processing; security concerns from users associated with storing personally identifiable data in the cloud; and other issues such as the increased power consumption and communication costs cloud services entail. The new sensor products feature a stacked configuration consisting of a pixel chip and logic chip."</em> <a href="https://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press/202005/20-037E/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Toshiba Electronic Devices &amp; Storage Corporation (“Toshiba”) has launched “TPD7107F,” a gate driver switch IPD[1] that controls the conduction and shut-off of current supplied to automotive electronic control units (ECUs), such as junction boxes and body control modules. Shipments start today. Combined with Toshiba’s automotive low On-resistance N-channel MOSFET[2], TPD7107F can form a high-side switch suitable for load current. As an electronic switch, free from the contact wear of mechanical relays, the new IPD can help to reduce the size and power consumption of automotive ECUs, and to make them maintenance-free. By delivering enhanced functions that support the high reliability required for automotive ECUs—a self-protection function and various built-in diagnostic functions that are output to the microcontroller—the new IPD monitors load operation and the MOSFET to which it is connected. In abnormal operation, it rapidly turns off the MOSFET[3] to reduce the load on the MOSFET."</em> <a href="https://toshiba.semicon-storage.com/ap-en/company/news/news-topics/2020/05/automotive-20200514-1.html">[...]</a>

Fast Ethernet opens up possibility for low latency &amp; high bandwidth Artnet LED projects, streaming audio, open sound control and other Ethernet-based protocols that were difficult to accomplish with a traditional SPI-based Ethernet shield. Traditionally use of Ethernet in a project has involved a choice of single board computers with high bandwidth Ethernet using systems not designed for low latency tasks, versus microcontrollers designed for real-time tasks but with slow Ethernet or lacking performance to handle Ethernet’s speed. Teensy 4.1 with a Cortex-M7 processor at 600 MHz opens up the possibility to use the high bandwidth and low latency of Ethernet on a microcontroller designed for real-time tasks."</em> <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/teensy-4-1-released/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"For the first time, researchers have succeeded in creating strong coupling between quantum systems over a greater distance. They accomplished this with a novel method in which a laser loop connects the systems, enabling nearly lossless exchange of information and strong interaction between them. In the scientific journal Science, the physicists from the University of Basel and University of Hanover reported that the new method opens up new possibilities in quantum networks and quantum sensor technology. Quantum technology is currently one of the most active fields of research worldwide. It takes advantage of the special properties of quantum mechanical states of atoms, light, or nanostructures to develop, for example, novel sensors for medicine and navigation, networks for information processing and powerful simulators for materials sciences. Generating these quantum states normally requires a strong interaction between the systems involved, such as between several atoms or nanostructures."</em> <a href="https://www.unibas.ch/en/News-Events/News/Uni-Research/Laser-loop-couples-quantum-systems-over-a-distance.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A novel technology that can improve the efficiency of quantum dot solar cells to 11.53% has been unveiled. Published in the February 2020 issue of Advanced Energy Materials, it has been evaluated as a study that solved the challenges posed by the generation of electric currents from sunlight by solar cells by enhancing the hole extraction. A research team, led by Professor Sung-Yeon Jang in the School of Energy and Chemical Engineering at UNIST has developed a photovoltaic device that maximizes the performance of quantum dot solar cells by using organic polymers. Solar cells use a characteristic of which electrons and holes are generated in the absorber layer. The free free electrons and hole then move through the cell, creating and filling in holes. It is this movement of electrons and holes that generate electricity."</em> <a href="https://news.unist.ac.kr/enhancing-quantum-dot-solar-cell-efficiency-to-11-53/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"It’s a frustrating limitation of 3D printing: Printed objects must be smaller than the machine making them. Huge machines are impractical for printing large parts because they take up too much space and require excessive time to print. Now, a new material reported in ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces can be used to 3D print small objects that expand upon heating. The foam could find applications in architecture, aerospace and biomedicine. One type of 3D printing, stereolithography, creates objects by exposing sequential layers of light-sensitive resins to patterns of light, which cure the polymer into the desired shape. Large objects can be created with specialized stereolithography machines, but they are usually made by fastening smaller 3D-printed components together."</em> <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/presspacs/2020/acs-presspac-may-13-2020/expandable-foam-for-3d-printing-large-objects-video.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Linking multiple copies of these devices may lay the foundation for quantum computing. Once unimaginable, transistors consisting only of several-atom clusters or even single atoms promise to become the building blocks of a new generation of computers with unparalleled memory and processing power. But to realize the full potential of these tiny transistors — miniature electrical on-off switches — researchers must find a way to make many copies of these notoriously difficult-to-fabricate components. Now, researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and their colleagues at the University of Maryland have developed a step-by-step recipe to produce the atomic-scale devices. Using these instructions, the NIST-led team has become only the second in the world to construct a single-atom transistor and the first to fabricate a series of single electron transistors with atom-scale control over the devices’ geometry. The scientists demonstrated that they could precisely adjust the rate at which individual electrons flow through a physical gap or electrical barrier in their transistor — even though classical physics would forbid the electrons from doing so because they lack enough energy."</em> <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2020/05/nist-scientists-create-new-recipe-single-atom-transistors">[...]</a>

Allowing users to create objects from simple toys to custom prosthetic parts, plastics are a popular 3D printing material. But these printed parts are mechanically weak — a flaw caused by the imperfect bonding between the individual printed layers that make up the 3D part. Researchers at Texas A&amp;M University, in collaboration with scientists in the company Essentium, Inc. have now developed the technology needed to overcome 3D printing’s “weak spot.” By integrating plasma science and carbon nanotube technology into standard 3D printing, the researchers welded adjacent printed layers more effectively, increasing the overall reliability of the final part. “Finding a way to remedy the inadequate bonding between printed layers has been an ongoing quest in the 3D printing field,” said Micah Green, associate professor in the Artie McFerrin Department of Chemical Engineering. “We have now developed a sophisticated technology that can bolster welding between these layers all while printing the 3D part.” Their findings were published in the February issue of the journal Nano Letters."</em> <a href="https://today.tamu.edu/2020/05/12/researchers-invent-technology-to-remedy-3d-printings-weak-spot/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"OAK RIDGE, Tenn., May 12, 2020 — For the second year in a row, a team from the Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge and Los Alamos national laboratories led a demonstration hosted by EPB, a community-based utility and telecommunications company serving Chattanooga, Tennessee. Using an isolated portion of EPB’s fiber-optic network, the team experimented with quantum-based technologies that could improve the cybersecurity, longevity and efficiency of the nation’s power grid. Among other successes, the researchers drastically increased the range that these resources can cover in collaboration with their new industry partner, Qubitekk. The team tested quantum key distribution, or QKD, systems that harness the power of quantum mechanics to authenticate data and encrypt messages with a secret “key.” Using private encryption methods, the key securely transmits “locked” information from one QKD system to another through a “trusted node” that is virtually invulnerable to cyberattacks. “This technology relies not on the mathematical laws that govern modern computer security but on the physical laws of quantum mechanics that do not change over time,” said Raymond Newell, who leads LANL’s quantum communications team. “As a result, we can make security assurances that will remain true indefinitely because they do not rely on assumptions.” Last year, ORNL, LANL and EPB demonstrated that QKD systems could work together seamlessly despite having different underlying hardware and software components, an important step toward eventually incorporating QKD into the grid — which provides electricity to buildings throughout the United States — on a national level."</em> <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/news/ornl-lanl-developed-quantum-technologies-go-distance">[...]</a>

In Applied Physics Reviews, from AIP Publishing, the group reports on its new approach that demonstrates significant improvements in speed and quality compared with other methods.

Building on their expertise in design and characterisation of plasmonic nanostructures with tailored optical properties, Professor Anatoly Zayats (Head of the King’s Photonics &amp; Nanotechnology group), Dr Diane Roth (Research Associate), Dr Alexander Minovich (former The Royal Society Newton International Fellow at King’s) and colleagues in China have developed a 2D layered nanostructure, capable of reflecting white light in a controlled direction, which is different from the direction of the conventional mirror reflection. With the ability to manipulate the light reflection in a very precise way, the researchers trick the eye to perceive a 2D structure as a real 3D object. In their study, the research team encoded an image of a 3D cube onto the metasurface as a proof of concept. The projected image of the cube reacts to variations in the direction of illumination or viewing angle to produce an appropriate change in the brightness of the cube faces. Unlike typical holograms, metasurfaces manipulate the reflection of all colours of light simultaneously, so they appear as a realistic 3D object in any light condition and from any angle of observation."</em> <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/kings-physicists-generate-3-dimensional-colour-images-with-2-dimensional-nanostructured-surfaces">[...]</a>

<p><em>"I designed this small device to be able to alert me in the unfortunate event the nozzle clogs. It does so by monitoring the flow of the filament This small device allows you to detect if the nozzle of your 3D printer clogs at any time while it's running. Jamming does not happen very often but when you are printing large parts it can really save you a lot of time to be alerted as quick as possible. It is attached to the top of the extruder using double-side tape and it is connected to the 12 V DC rail of the hotend fan. I printed mine in ABS to prevent deformation of some parts due to heat since my Prusa is enclosed. "</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/Elite_Worm/3d-printer-clog-detector-e28116">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Converts images to heat - not the other way around This little selfie camera was made as a weekend project almost two years ago. Practically everything came out of my parts bin and so it fit the Making Tech At Home contest perfectly. Although I've already written a blog post about it and published the source code on GitHub, I decided to write a few more words on the subject because the previous documentation doesn't quite demonstrate how hacky it actually was.

<p><em>"The Index Pick and Place is an open source pick and place machine to aid in Mid-Scale Manufacturing. This project is under development. It is not currently in a stable state. Development is active and ongoing, but this is not yet a finished design. If you'd like to build one to help find bugs and design issues, please do! The Index is designed to be low-cost enough that someone could buy or build one to support making production runs at home or as a small business."</em> <a href="https://github.com/sphawes/index">[...]</a>
