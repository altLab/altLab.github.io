<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1799 o astrónomo inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lassell">William Lassell</a>. Ele construiu seu próprio telescópio de 24" de diâmetro e criou equipamentos movidos a vapor para polir o espelho de metal de especulo. Este telescópio foi o primeiro do seu tamanho a ser montado "equitativamente" para facilitar a observação das estrelas. Ele descobriu Triton, uma lua de Neptuno, e Ariel e Umbriel, satélites de Úrano. Mais tarde, Lassell construiu um telescópio de 48" de diâmetro com o mesmo design e transportou-o para Malta para observações com céu mais claro.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1918 o químico americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Karle">Jerome Karle</a>. Ele partilhou o prémio Nobel de química em 1985 (com Herbert A. Hauptman) pelas "suas realizações notáveis no desenvolvimento de métodos directos para a determinação de estruturas cristalinas". O seu trabalho possibilitou a determinação de estruturas de cristal 3D, como moléculas de hormónios, vitaminas e antibióticos. Ele começou a sua carreira com um breve período em Chicago, no início da década de 1940, a trabalhar para o Projecto Manhattan, desenvolvendo a bomba atómica, e então juntou-se à equipa do Laboratório de Pesquisa Naval em 1946. Ele tornou-se o cientista chefe do Laboratório de Estrutura da Matéria. em 1968.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1926 o astrónomo americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Sandage">Allan Sandage</a>. Juntamente com Thomas A. Matthews descobriu, em 1960, a primeira identificação óptica de uma fonte de rádio quase-estelar (quasar), um objecto semelhante a uma estrela que é um forte emissor de ondas de rádio. Embora fosse uma fonte estranha de emissão de rádio, sob luz visível, parecia uma estrela fraca. No entanto, este objecto emitia ondas de rádio e radiação ultravioleta mais intensas do que uma estrela típica.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1932, o químico americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dudley_R._Herschbach">Dudley R. Herschbach</a>. Ele foi pioneiro no uso de feixes moleculares para elucidar os processos de reacções químicas. Este estudo da dinâmica da reacção detalha a sequência de eventos e estados de energia dos átomos e moléculas. Pelos seus trabalhos recebeu o Prémio Nobel da química em 1986 (Juntamente com Yuan T. Lee e John C. Polanyi).</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou foi lançada a versão 1.8.13 do Arduino IDE. De entre as inúmeras correcções de erros, esta versão introduz uma melhoria significativa na organização do menu de placas listadas no Menu "Tools".</p>

<h2><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/17/quantum-machines-announces-qua-its-universal-language-for-quantum-computing/">Quantum Machines announces QUA, its universal language for quantum computing</a></h2>

<p><em>"It’s a busy week in the world of quantum computing, and today Tel Aviv-based Quantum Machines, a startup that is building a software and hardware stack for controlling and operating quantum computers, announced the launch of QUA, a new language that it calls the first “standard universal language for quantum computers.” Quantum Machines CEO Itamar Sivan likened QUA to developments like Intel’s x86 and Nvidia’s CUDA, both of which provide the low-level tools for developers to get the most out of their hardware. Quantum Machine’s own control hardware is essentially agnostic with regards to the underlying quantum technology that its customers want to use. The idea here is that if the company manages to make its own hardware the standard for controlling these systems, then its language will — almost by default — become the standard as well. And while it’s a “universal” language in the technical sense, it is — at least for now — meant to run on Quantum Machine’s own Quantum Orchestration Platform, which it announced earlier this year. “QUA is basically the language of the Quantum Orchestration Platform,” Sivan told me. “But beyond that, QUA is what we believe the first candidate to become what we define as the ‘quantum computing software abstraction layer.’ ” He argued that we are now at the right stage for the development of this layer because the underlying hardware has reached a matureness and because these systems are now fully programmable."</em> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/17/quantum-machines-announces-qua-its-universal-language-for-quantum-computing/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The rocket booster segments that will help power NASA’s first Artemis flight test mission around the Moon arrived at the agency’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Monday for launch preparations. All 10 segments for the inaugural flight of NASA’s first Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion spacecraft were shipped by train from Promontory, Utah. The 10-day, cross-country journey is an important milestone toward the first launch for NASA’s Artemis program. “The arrival of the booster segments at Kennedy is just the beginning of the SLS rocket’s journey to the pad and onward to send the Orion spacecraft to the Moon,“ said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. “Artemis I will pave the way toward landing the first woman and the next man on the surface of the Moon in 2024 and expanding human exploration to Mars.” Each rocket booster has individual motor segments, located between the forward assemblies and aft skirts, making up the largest single component of the entire booster. The two SLS rocket boosters, four RS-25 engines, and core stage, produce a combined total of more than 8.8 million pounds of thrust power during launch."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/rocket-motors-for-first-nasa-artemis-moon-mission-arrive-at-spaceport">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Solid state batteries are of great interest to the electric vehicle industry. Scientists at Chalmers and Xi'an Jiaotong University, China now present a new way of taking this promising concept closer to large-scale application. An interlayer, made of a spreadable, ‘butter-like’ material helps improve the current density tenfold, while also increasing performance and safety.​​​​​​​​ "This interlayer makes the battery cell significantly more stable, and therefore able to withstand much higher current density. What is also important is that it is very easy to apply the soft mass onto the lithium metal anode in the battery – like spreading butter on a sandwich,” says researcher Shizhao Xiong at the Department of Physics at Chalmers. Alongside Chalmers Professor Aleksandar Matic and Professor Song's research group in Xi'an, Shizhao Xiong has been working for a long time on crafting a suitable interlayer to stabilise the interface for solid state battery.

<h2><a href="https://ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2020/06/the-first-intuitive-programming-language-for-quantum-computers.html">The first intuitive programming language for quantum computers</a></h2>

<p><em>"Several technical advances have been achieved recently in the pursuit of powerful quantum computers. Now, Computer scientists from ETH Zurich have made an important breakthrough in the field of programming languages: their quantum language is the first of its kind that is as elegant, simple and safe as classical computer languages. Programming quantum computers is becoming easier: computer scientists at ETH Zurich have designed the first programming language that can be used to program quantum computers as simply, reliably and safely as classical computers. “Programming quantum computers is still a challenge for researchers,” says Martin Vechev, computer science professor in ETH’s Secure, Reliable and Intelligent Systems Lab (SRI), “which is why I’m so excited that we can now continue ETH Zurich’s tradition in the development of quantum computers and programming languages.” He adds: “Our quantum programming language Silq allows programmers to utilize the potential of quantum computers better than with existing languages, because the code is more compact, faster, more intuitive and easier to understand for programmers.” This week, Vechev will introduce Silq to other experts in the field at PLDI 2020, a conference for programming languages. To facilitate discussion, adoption and further development, he and his team have also released Silq on its own website (silq.ethz.ch). Quantum computing has been seeing increased attention over the last decade, since these computers, which function according to the principles of quantum physics, have enormous potential."</em> <a href="https://ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2020/06/the-first-intuitive-programming-language-for-quantum-computers.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"An international team led by scientists at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) has recently developed the world’s first 3D artificial eye with capabilities better than existing bionic eyes and in some cases, even exceed those of the human eyes, bringing vision to humanoid robots and new hope to patients with visual impairment. Scientists have spent decades trying to replicate the structure and clarity of a biological eye, but vision provided by existing prosthetic eyes – largely in the form of spectacles attached with external cables, are still in poor resolution with 2D flat image sensors. The Electrochemical Eye (EC-Eye) developed at HKUST, however, not only replicates the structure of a natural eye for the first time, but may actually offer sharper vision than a human eye in the future, with extra functions such as the ability to detect infrared radiation in darkness. The key feature allowing such breakthroughs is a 3D artificial retina - made of an array of nanowire light sensors which mimic the photoreceptors in human retinas. Developed by Prof. FAN Zhiyong and Dr. GU Leilei from the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering at HKUST, the team connected the nanowire light sensors to a bundle of liquid-metal wires serving as nerves behind the man-made hemispherical retina during the experiment, and successfully replicated the visual signal transmission to reflect what the eye sees onto the computer screen."</em> <a href="https://www.ust.hk/news/research-and-innovation/hkust-scientists-develop-worlds-first-spherical-artificial-eye-3d">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers at Konkuk University in South Korea recently created KUBeetle-S, a flying robot inspired by a species of horned beetle called Allomyrina dichotoma, which is among the largest insects on the planet. Allomyrina dichtoma weighs approximately 5 to 10 g and has a wing loading of 40 N/m2, which is remarkably high when compared to average insect wing loadings (typically around 8 N/m2). "To mimic the beetle's flight, we first developed a flapping-wing mechanism that can create a large flapping angle and produce lift to compensate weight of the KUBeetle-S, just like the horned beetle it draws inspiration from," Prof. Hoon Cheol Park, one of the researchers who carried out the recent study, told TechXplore. "Since the KUBeetle-S is not equipped with control surfaces at the tail, unlike a conventional flyer, its flapping wings must be able to produce control moments only by changing their wing kinematics in the middle of the flapping motion." The control moment generator that Prof. Park and his colleagues installed within KUBeetle-S can change the robot's wing stroke plane to the right, left, front and back, ultimately enabling the redirection of its vertical lift as desired and simultaneously generating control moment. This generator is mechanically integrated with lightweight servo motors and can also be electronically controlled via a control board and a feedback control system based on an algorithm developed by the researchers."</em> <a href="https://techxplore.com/news/2020-06-kubeetle-s-insect-inspired-robot-minutes.html">[...]</a>

U of A scientists devised a means of improving the response by simulating a situation in which a mix of three quasiparticles creates a new quasiparticle they called “electroacoustic magnons.” “This mechanism provides opportunities to engineer the size and shape of the material to reach strikingly larger magnetoelectric responses,” said doctoral candidate Sayed Omid Sayedaghaee, first author of a paper published in the journal Nature Partner Journal Computational Materials."</em> <a href="https://news.uark.edu/articles/54135/physicists-document-method-to-improve-magnetoelectric-response">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A team of Purdue University innovators hopes its new technology provides a more business-friendly option to utilize sustainable cellulose nanomaterials for use in vehicles, food packaging and other manufactured items. The Purdue team developed a new way for manufacturers to use nanocellulose – a green nanomaterial derived from natural sources such as plant matter. Normally to process nanocellulose, solvents or other dispersants are usually added to the mixture to improve the material’s dispersion in polymers. “These methods can be very expensive for manufacturers, who must add additional processes and machinery to comply with emission standards that may be impacted by the use of the solvents,” said Jeffrey Youngblood, a professor of materials engineering in Purdue’s College of Engineering. The Purdue innovators created a method that involves mixing the nanocellulose in additives for the polymer material, such as plasticizer, and then compounding that mixture into the polymer instead of directly mixing them. This technique could be applicable to a wide variety of polymers, including nylons used in the automotive industry and polylactic acid and ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer used in food packaging."</em> <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2020/Q2/new-technique-for-polymer-manufacturing-with-reduced-solvents-aimed-at-vehicle,-packaging-production.html">[...]</a>

How it works It uses a servo to turn a robotic finger that slowly presses the switch down. When it detects that the switch has closed, it lights up the LED and waits 100 ms for the contacts to settle, before slowly releasing the switch until it detects that the switch has opened again. At this point it switches off the LED, resets the servo to the start position, and writes the measured activation and deactivation positions to the PC over the USB serial connection. In the event that the servo reaches the configured end point without the switch closing, or reaches the configured start point without the switch opening, it logs a failure instead."</em> <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/stories/keyswitch-tester.html">[...]</a>

This makes it impossible to receive data at the same time as it is being transmitted, and therefore the bit-banged implementations have been half-duplex. By using the waveform generator of the timer/counter in many AVR MCUs, I've found a way to implement a full-duplex UART, which can simultaneously send and receive at up to 115kbps when the MCU is clocked at 8Mhz.
