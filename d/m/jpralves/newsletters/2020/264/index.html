<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1792, o engenheiro e matemático francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaspard-Gustave_de_Coriolis">Gustave-Gaspard Coriolis</a>. Foi ele que descreveu a força que tem o seu nome - Coriolis, um efeito de movimento num corpo em rotação, de suma importância para meteorologia, balística e oceanografia. Enquanto as diferenças de pressão tendem a empurrar ventos em caminhos rectos, os ventos seguem caminhos curvos pela Terra. Em 1835, Coriolis primeiro deu uma descrição matemática do efeito, dando seu nome à força Coriolis. Enquanto o ar começa a fluir de alta para baixa pressão, a Terra gira sob ela, fazendo com que o vento pareça seguir um caminho curvo. No Hemisfério Norte, o vento vira à direita de sua direcção de movimento. No hemisfério sul, vira à esquerda. A força de Coriolis é zero no equador.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1850, o vulcanologista, sismólogo e clérigo italiano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Mercalli">Giuseppe Mercalli</a>. Ele criou a Escala de Intensidade Mercalli (1902), como uma melhoria da Escala de Rossi-Forel. Foi ordenado sacerdote católico romano e mais tarde tornou-se professor no seminário de Milão. A intensidade na escala de Mercalli é estimada com base nas observações de pessoas que sofreram o terremoto. Usando algarismos romanos, varia de I para agitação imperceptível a XII para destruição catastrófica de estruturas. A revisão produzida em 1931 pelos sismólogos americanos, Harry Wood e Frank Neumann, é conhecida como Escala de Intensidade Modificada Mercalli, agora em uso. Enquanto “magnitude”, como na Escala Richter, classifica um terremoto pela energia liberada na fonte, “intensidade” descreve os efeitos locais experimentados pelos observadores em qualquer local do epicentro.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1858, o matemático e teórico francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89douard_Goursat">Édouard Goursat</a>. Ele contribuiu para a teoria das funções, pseudo-integrais e integrais hiperelípticas e equações diferenciais influenciaram a escola francesa de matemática. O teorema de Cauchy-Goursat define que a integral de uma função em torno de um contorno fechado simples é zero se a função for analítica dentro do contorno. Cauchy tinha estabelecido o teorema com a condição adicional de que a derivada da função era contínua. Em 1891, ele escreveu Leçons sur l'intégration des équations aux dérivées partielles du premier ordre. O trabalho mais conhecido de Goursat é o Cours d'analyse mathématique (1900-10), que introduziu muitos novos conceitos de análise.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou a associação SD anunciou a especificação SD 8.0 para cartões de memória SD Express com velocidades de transferência ainda mais rápidas usando a popular especificação PCI Express® (PCIe®) 4.0, que fornece uma taxa de transferência de dados de quase 4 gigabytes por segundo (GB/s). Estes cartões de tamanho normal continuam a usar o protocolo da camada superior do NVMe Express™ (NVMe™), permitindo um mecanismo avançado de acesso à memória.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos assim como projetos de maker. É apresentada a revista HackspaceMag Nº 31 de Junho.</p>

<p><em>"After a year's worth of digging, Elon Musk's The Boring Company has completed the second tunnel for its underground people-mover system at the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC). It's keeping in step with an anticipated opening date in January 2021—just in time for the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES). So far, the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic hasn't yet altered these plans. Back in May 2019, the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority Board of Directors first approved the contract, and by February 2020, The Boring Company had completed the first tunnel. Overall, the goal is to "provide fast and convenient transportation for convention and trade show attendees across the LVCC campus," according to The Boring Company. Under normal circumstances, it takes about 15 minutes to walk from the convention center's New Exhibit Hall to the other side of the campus—something Musk's company claims it can cut down to a humble one-minute commute."</em> <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/infrastructure/a32477074/boring-company-las-vegas-loop-excavation/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.microchip.com/en/pressreleasepage/mchp-reveals-vectorbloxsdk-and-ip-for-fpga-smart-embedded-vision">Microchip Reveals Software Development Kit and Neural Network IP for Easily Creating Low-Power FPGA Smart Embedded Vision Solutions</a></h2>

<p><em>"Microchip’s VectorBlox SDK and IP offers an easy way for software developers to program a trained neural network without prior FPGA expertise With the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and the Internet of Things (IoT), applications are moving to the network edge where data is collected, requiring power-efficient solutions to deliver more computational performance in ever smaller, thermally constrained form factors. Through its Smart Embedded Vision initiative, Microchip Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP) is meeting the growing need for power-efficient inferencing in edge applications by making it easier for software developers to implement their algorithms in PolarFire® field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). As a significant addition to the solutions portfolio in this segment, Microchip’s VectorBlox Accelerator Software Development Kit (SDK) helps developers take advantage of Microchip’s PolarFire FPGAs for creating low-power, flexible overlay-based neural network applications without learning an FPGA tool flow. FPGAs are ideal for edge AI applications, such as inferencing in power-constrained compute environments, because they can perform more giga operations per second (GOPS) with greater power efficiency than a central processing unit (CPU) or graphics processing unit (GPU), but they require specialized hardware design skills. Microchip’s VectorBlox Accelerator SDK is designed to enable developers to code in C/C++ and program power-efficient neural networks without prior FPGA design experience. The highly flexible tool kit can execute models in TensorFlow and the open neural network exchange (ONNX) format which offers the widest framework interoperability."</em> <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en/pressreleasepage/mchp-reveals-vectorbloxsdk-and-ip-for-fpga-smart-embedded-vision">[...]</a>

The new foundry line, which will focus on EUV-based 5 nanometer (nm) and below process technology, has just commenced construction this month and is expected to be in full operation in the second half of 2021. It will play a pivotal role as Samsung aims to expand the use of state-of-the-art process technologies across a myriad of current and next generation applications, including 5G, high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI). “This new production facility will expand Samsung’s manufacturing capabilities for sub-5nm process and enable us to rapidly respond to the increasing demand for EUV-based solutions,” said Dr. ES Jung, President and Head of Foundry Business at Samsung Electronics. “We remain committed to addressing the needs of our customers through active investments and recruitment of talents. This will enable us to continue to break new ground while driving robust growth for Samsung’s foundry business.” Following the initial mass production of the EUV-based 7nm process in early 2019, Samsung recently added a new EUV-dedicated V1 line in Hwaseong, Korea, to its global foundry network."</em> <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-expands-its-foundry-capacity-with-a-new-production-line-in-pyeongtaek-korea">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The rolling hills of Mars or the moon are a long way from the nearest tow truck. That’s why the next generation of exploration rovers will need to be good at climbing hills covered with loose material and avoiding entrapment on soft granular surfaces. Built with wheeled appendages that can be lifted and wheels able to wiggle, a new robot known as the “Mini Rover” has developed and tested complex locomotion techniques robust enough to help it climb hills covered with such granular material – and avoid the risk of getting ignominiously stuck on some remote planet or moon. Using a complex move the researchers dubbed “rear rotator pedaling,” the robot can climb a slope by using its unique design to combine paddling, walking, and wheel spinning motions. The rover’s behaviors were modeled using a branch of physics known as terradynamics. “When loose materials flow, that can create problems for robots moving across it,” said Dan Goldman, the Dunn Family Professor in the School of Physics at the Georgia Institute of Technology."</em> <a href="https://news.gatech.edu/2020/05/13/planetary-exploration-rover-avoids-sand-traps-rear-rotator-pedaling">[...]</a>

European researchers are now studying a new light-emitting alloy of silicon and germanium to obtain photonic chips, which can revolutionise computing.

The very large bandwidth of optical signals has driven the enormous growth of telephone systems, television broadcasting and the internet. However, photons have not yet replaced electrons in computers. Using light for transmitting data in processor chips and their interconnections would allow a substantial increase in the speed of computers (the speed of on-chip and chip-to-chip communication could be increased by a factor of 1000) and at the same time reduce the power required for them to operate."</em> <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/article/id/418148-light-emitting-silicon-no-longer-a-holy-grail-for-computing">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Three-dimensional (3D) nano-printing of freeform optical waveguides, also referred to as photonic wire bonding, allows for efficient coupling between photonic chips and can greatly simplify optical system assembly. As a key advantage, the shape and the trajectory of photonic wire bonds can be adapted to the mode-field profiles and the positions of the chips, thereby offering an attractive alternative to conventional optical assembly techniques that rely on technically complex and costly high-precision alignment. However, while the fundamental advantages of the photonic wire bonding concept have been shown in proof-of-concept experiments, it has so far been unclear whether the technique can also be leveraged for practically relevant use cases with stringent reproducibility and reliability requirements. In this paper, we demonstrate optical communication engines that rely on photonic wire bonding for connecting arrays of silicon photonic modulators to InP lasers and single-mode fibres. In a first experiment, we show an eight-channel transmitter offering an aggregate line rate of 448 Gbit/s by low-complexity intensity modulation. A second experiment is dedicated to a four-channel coherent transmitter, operating at a net data rate of 732.7 Gbit/s – a record for coherent silicon photonic transmitters with co-packaged lasers."</em> <a href="http://www.iph.rwth-aachen.de/?p=2458">[...]</a>

U.S. and German physicists have found surprising evidence that one of the most famous phenomena in modern physics — the quantum Hall effect — is “reincarnated” in topological superconductors that could be used to build fault-tolerant quantum computers. The 1980 discovery of the quantum Hall effect kicked off the study of topological orders, electronic states with “protected” patterns of long-range quantum entanglement that are remarkably robust. The stability of these protected states is extremely attractive for quantum computing, which uses quantum entanglement to store and process information. In a study published online this month in Physical Review X (PRX), theoretical physicists from Rice University, the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), and the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Karlsruhe, Germany, presented strong numerical evidence for a surprising link between 2D and 3D phases of topological matter.

For decades, carbon fibers have been a mainstay of airplane production. If created in the right way, these long strands of carbon-based atoms, narrower than human hair, are lightweight, stiff and strong — a perfect application for keeping passengers safe in a vehicle soaring miles above the ground. “Even though carbon fibers have really nice features, they would make a car far more expensive” with the way carbon fibers are manufactured now, said Adri van Duin, professor of mechanical and chemical engineering, Penn State. “If you can get these properties easier to manufacture then you can make cars significantly lighter, lower the cost of them and make them safer.” Carbon fiber sells for about $15 per pound today, and the team, which includes researchers from Penn State, the University of Virginia and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, in collaboration with industry partners Solvay and Oshkosh, wants to reduce that to $5 per pound by making changes to the complex production process."</em> <a href="https://news.psu.edu/story/620332/2020/05/18/research/graphene-reinforced-carbon-fiber-may-lead-affordable-stronger-car">[...]</a>

Higher field frequencies mean that electrons can do their job faster, enabling higher data transfer rates and greater processor speeds."</em> <a href="https://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pOid=60934&amp;pNid=99">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=117185">Electrons Break Rotational Symmetry in Exotic Low-Temp Superconductor</a></h2>

<p><em>"Scientists previously observed this peculiar behavior—characterized by electrons preferentially traveling along one direction, decoupled from the host crystal structure—in other materials whose ability to conduct electricity without energy loss cannot be explained by standard theoretical frameworks Scientists have discovered that the transport of electronic charge in a metallic superconductor containing strontium, ruthenium, and oxygen breaks the rotational symmetry of the underlying crystal lattice. The strontium ruthenate crystal has fourfold rotational symmetry like a square, meaning that it looks identical when turned by 90 degrees (four times to equal a complete 360-degree rotation). However, the electrical resistivity has twofold (180-degree) rotational symmetry like a rectangle. This “electronic nematicity”—the discovery of which is reported in a paper published on May 4 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences—may promote the material’s “unconventional” superconductivity. For unconventional superconductors, standard theories of metallic conduction are inadequate to explain how upon cooling they can conduct electricity without resistance (i.e., losing energy to heat). If scientists can come up with an appropriate theory, they may be able to design superconductors that don’t require expensive cooling to achieve their near-perfect energy efficiency."</em> <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=117185">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Waves, whether they are light waves, sound waves, or any other kind, travel in the same manner in forward and reverse directions—this is known as the principle of reciprocity. If we could route waves in one direction only—breaking reciprocity—we could transform a number of applications important in our daily lives. Breaking reciprocity would allow us to build novel “one-way” components such as circulators and isolators that enable two-way communication, which could double the data capacity of today’s wireless networks. These components are essential to quantum computers, where one wants to read a qubit without disturbing it. They are also critical to radar systems, whether in self-driving cars or those used by the military. A team led by Harish Krishnaswamy, professor of electrical engineering, is the first to build a high-performance non-reciprocal device on a compact chip with a performance 25 times better than previous work."</em> <a href="https://engineering.columbia.edu/press-releases/one-way-electronic-devices">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The high cost of platinum catalysts used in hydrogen fuel cells limits the commercialization of fuel cell electric vehicles. Scientists are studying alternative catalysts to increase cost-effectiveness and maintain efficiency of hydrogen fuel cells. Researchers are increasingly looking to hydrogen fuel cell systems as alternate power sources for vehicles and other applications due to their fast refueling time, high energy density and lack of harmful emissions or byproducts. Scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory have recently developed and studied fuel cell catalysts — chemicals that speed up important fuel cell reactions — that don’t use platinum. The research provides better understanding of the mechanisms that make these catalysts effective, and the new insights could help inform the production of even more efficient and cost-effective catalysts. “Currently, the oxygen reduction reaction is facilitated by platinum alloy catalysts, which are the most expensive component of the fuel cell electrodes,” said Deborah Myers, a senior chemist and the leader of the Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Materials group in Argonne’s Chemical Sciences and Engineering (CSE) division."</em> <a href="https://www.anl.gov/article/platinumfree-catalysts-could-make-cheaper-hydrogen-fuel-cells">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The ATTiny85 is a nice cheap micro-controller useful for standalone applications with a small amount of I/O and not needing connectivity like wifi. A convenient way of using these is with the Digispark type modules as they incorporate a very convenient way of uploading sketches from an Arduino IDE using the USB bootloader. When using these modules in battery powered applications one often wants to reduce power consumption by using the sleep capabilities of the ATTiny85. The processor itself has low sleep current which can be further reduced by turning off functional pieces of the micro-controller. On these boards, however, there is a extra current drain which impacts on the utility of sleep. This instructable shows how to modify the boards so that current draw during sleep is primarily that of the micro-controller itself."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Reducing-Sleep-Current-in-ATTiny-Digispark/">[...]</a>
