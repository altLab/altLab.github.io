<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1779, o químico sueco <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6ns_Jacob_Berzelius">Jons Jacob Berzelius</a>. Ele estabeleceu as bases da química moderna. Entre suas contribuições estão a determinação de pesos atómicos, a substituição de signos alquímicos por letras para símbolos químicos e o uso de pequenos números para indicar proporções relativas a fórmula de um composto, novos métodos analíticos e uma teoria electroquímica. Ele descobriu o selénio e o tório e co-descobriu o cério. Os seus alunos isolaram lítio (Johann Awfwedsen), vanádio (Nils Sefstrom) e vários elementos de terras raras (Carl Mosander). Berzelius usou uma corrente eléctrica para determinar que os sais podiam ser divididos em partes positivas e negativas.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1957, o matemático britânico <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Donaldson">Simon Donaldson</a>. Ele recebeu a Medalha Fields em 1986 pelo seu trabalho em topologia. Quase todo o seu trabalho se enquadra nas duas esferas de geometria diferencial de feixes de vectores holomórficos e aplicações da teoria de calibre para topologia de 4 variedades. Surpreendentemente, Donaldson resolveu problemas de matemática usando ideias da física (enquanto a maioria da matemática é geralmente aplicada à física). A partir das generalizações de Yang-Mills das equações electromagnéticas de James Clerk Maxwell, Donaldson usou soluções especiais para essas equações, chamadas instantons, para examinar as quatro variedades gerais. Depois de receber a Medalha Fields, Donaldson continuou sua exploração de ideias da física com aplicações à matemática.</p>

<p>E nesta semana que passou, o Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), uma câmara de pesquisa robótica localizada no Observatório Palomar perto de San Diego, avistou um asteróide que tinha, poucas horas antes, viajado apenas 2.950 quilómetros acima da superfície da Terra. Designado por 2020 QG, é o asteróide conhecido que mais próximo passou pela Terra sem chocar com o planeta. O Asteróide 2020 QG tem cerca de 3 a 6 metros de diâmetro, e como tal não era grande o suficiente para causar qualquer dano, mesmo se tivesse vindo na direcção da Terra; a nossa atmosfera trataria de o queimar.</p>

<p>Também esta semana que passou, cientistas resolveram um problema antigo de calcular em que medida a nossa lua se está a afastar da Terra. A Lua afasta-se sensivelmente quatro centímetros da Terra por ano. Durante décadas, os cientistas mediram o recuo da lua disparando um laser contra painéis reflectores de luz, conhecidos como retro-reflectores, que foram deixados na superfície lunar, e cronometrando a viagem de ida e volta da luz. Mas os cinco retro-reflectores da lua são antigos e agora são muito menos eficientes a lançar a luz de volta. Para determinar se uma camada de poeira lunar pode ser a culpada, os investigadores desenvolveram um plano audacioso: eles lançaram a luz laser de um retro-reflector muito menor, mas mais recente, montado a bordo de uma nave espacial da NASA que estava a deslizar sobre a superfície da lua a milhares de quilómetros por hora. E funcionou. Os resultados foram publicados este mês na revista Earth, Planets and Space.</p>

<p>Ainda esta semana a Cerebras anunciou um novo recorde para processadores. Foi anunciado o novo CWSE (Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine) usando tecnologia de 7 nm e produzido pela TSMC ele tem 850,000 cores optimizados para IA, com 2.6 Biliões de Transístores.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos assim como projetos de maker. É apresentada a revista Hackspace Magazine Nº34 de Setembro assim como alguns livros.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.space.com/amp/closest-asteroid-flyby-of-earth-recorded.html">ZTF Finds Closest Known Asteroid to Fly By Earth</a></h2>

<p><em>"On August 16, the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), a robotic survey camera located at Palomar Observatory near San Diego, spotted an asteroid that had, just hours earlier, traveled only 1,830 miles (2,950 kilometers) above Earth's surface. Designated 2020 QG, it is the closest known asteroid to fly by Earth without impacting the planet. The previous known record-holder is asteroid 2011 CQ1, discovered by the Catalina Sky Survey in 2011, which passed above Earth about 1,550 miles (2,500 kilometers) higher than 2020 QG. Asteroid 2020 QG is about 10 to 20 feet (3 to 6 meters) across, or roughly the size of an SUV, so it was not big enough to do any damage even if it had been pointed at Earth; instead, it would have burned up in our planet's atmosphere. "The asteroid flew close enough to Earth that Earth's gravity significantly changed its orbit," says ZTF co-investigator Tom Prince, the Ira S. Bowen Professor of Physics at Caltech and a senior research scientist at JPL, which Caltech manages for NASA. Asteroids of this size that fly roughly as close to Earth as 2020 QG do occur about once a year or less, but many of them are never detected."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/amp/closest-asteroid-flyby-of-earth-recorded.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/solve-moon-mystery-fire-laser-160158582.html">How Do You Solve a Moon Mystery? Fire a Laser at It</a></h2>

<p><em>"The moon is drifting away. Every year, it gets about an inch and a half farther from us. Hundreds of millions of years from now, our companion in the sky will be distant enough that there will be no more total solar eclipses. For decades, scientists have measured the moon’s retreat by firing a laser at light-reflecting panels, known as retroreflectors, that were left on the lunar surface, and then timing the light’s round trip. But the moon’s five retroreflectors are old, and they’re now much less efficient at flinging back light. To determine whether a layer of moon dust might be the culprit, researchers devised an audacious plan: They bounced laser light off a much smaller but newer retroreflector mounted aboard a NASA spacecraft that was skimming over the moon’s surface at thousands of miles per hour."</em> <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/solve-moon-mystery-fire-laser-160158582.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A few years ago, we started to see researchers discussing an old manufacturing idea first explored in the 1980s: Wafer-scale processing. The idea of WSP is straightforward: Instead of dicing a wafer into individual chips and then packaging those chips for resale, build a single core or collection of cores using much, if not all, of the wafer for a single chip. The AI/machine learning startup Cerebras has revived the idea of wafer-scale processing for a first-generation processor we covered last year. The “old” Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine (CWSE) was a 16nm wafer with 400,000 AI cores, 1.2T transistors, 18GB of onboard memory, 9 PB/s of total memory bandwidth, and 100Pb/s of total fabric bandwidth. The new version of the CWSE is supposedly even larger: 850,000 AI-optimized cores 2.6 Trillion Transistors TSMC 7nm Process That’s a whole lot of transistors. And cores."</em> <a href="https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/313940-cerebras-wafer-packs-2-6-trillion-transistor-cpu-with-850000-cores">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This represents the industry's first sensor1 enabling real-time simultaneous measurement of the flow rate and concentration of hydrogen under a highly humid environment Panasonic Corporation has developed an ultrasonic gas flow and concentration sensor for hydrogen that enables the real-time simultaneous measurement of the flow rate and concentration of hydrogen under a highly humid environment for the first time in the industry. In recent years, with growing interest in hydrogen as the next generation energy, actions aimed at utilizing hydrogen energy are actively being promoted around the world. With the aim of further spreading and expanding fuel cells that generate electricity through the chemical reaction of hydrogen, the research and evaluation of stack units used as key components are becoming increasingly important. However, it is difficult for fuel cells to cause a full reaction of all of supplied hydrogen, and the unreacted hydrogen is exposed to high temperature and very humid conditions due to heat and water produced through the chemical reaction. In order to increase the efficiency of stack unit evaluation and the utilization ratio of hydrogen, it is effective to collect and recycle unreacted hydrogen. However, there is a problem whereby it is difficult for the conventional thermal flow rate sensor and concentration sensor to accurately measure the unreacted hydrogen because the sensor has poor performance under humid conditions."</em> <a href="https://news.panasonic.com/global/press/data/2020/08/en200818-2/en200818-2.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Builds on company’s work with industry standards bodies and lead customers who are using the devices to create capture cards and cameras supporting the new specifications Until the 12.5Gbps CoaXPress® 2.0 interface standard was ratified last year, machine-vision image-capture solutions had replaced conveyor belts as the primary roadblock to achieving faster production-line throughput. Now, Microchip Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP) has taken the next step toward realizing the full potential of CoaXPress (CXP) on the factory floor with the first single-chip physical-layer interface devices to include features that streamline machine vision system design, maximize transmission speed and simplify deployment in high-volume bottling operations, food inspection, industrial inspection and imaging applications. “We have worked with the Japan Industrial Imaging Association (JIIA) standards organization and our lead customers to optimize our offering in conjunction with CXP so it fully exploits the specification’s benefits on the factory floor,” said Matthias Kaestner, vice president, Automotive Infotainment Systems business unit. “Our low-latency, low-power transmission solutions integrate an equalizer, cable driver and clock data recovery into a single chip that enables camera and capture card manufacturers to deliver high-speed, high-resolution video and control signaling along with power over a single coax cable.” Microchip’s EQCO125X40 family of CoaXPress devices is the first to implement the CXP 2.0 standard, starting from a new backward compatible design based on the specification, with an integrated clock data recovery (CDR) at all speed levels and a camera-side clock to support the demands of real-world environments. The devices significantly increase machine-vision processing throughput by enabling cameras and capture cards to transmit four to eight times faster than alternative solutions. In addition, these devices enable four times the cable/link distance with much lower power and near-zero latency."</em> <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en/pressreleasepage/microchip-announces-high-speed-coaxpress-2.0-devices-that-speed-machine-vision-image-capture-while-simplifying-system-design-and-deployment">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Company achieves a quantum volume of 64 through full-stack improvements Today, IBM has unveiled a new milestone on its quantum computing road map, achieving the company's highest Quantum Volume to date. Combining a series of new software and hardware techniques to improve overall performance, IBM has upgraded one of its newest 27-qubit client-deployed systems to achieve a Quantum Volume 64. The company has made a total of 28 quantum computers available over the last four years through IBM Quantum Experience. In order to achieve a Quantum Advantage, the point where certain information processing tasks can be performed more efficiently or cost effectively on a quantum computer, versus a classical one, it will require improved quantum circuits, the building blocks of quantum applications. Quantum Volume measures the length and complexity of circuits – the higher the Quantum Volume, the higher the potential for exploring solutions to real world problems across industry, government, and research.

<h2><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-0/">Announcing TypeScript 4.0</a></h2>

<p><em>"Today we are thrilled to announce the availability of TypeScript 4.0! This version of the language represents our next generation of TypeScript releases, as we dive deeper into expressivity, productivity, and scalability. If you’re not familiar with TypeScript, it’s a language that builds on top of JavaScript by adding syntax for static types. The idea is that by writing down the types of your values and where they’re used, you can use TypeScript to type-check your code and tell you about mistakes before you run your code (and even before saving your file). You can then use the TypeScript compiler to then strip away types from your code, and leaving you with clean, readable JavaScript that runs anywhere. Beyond checking, TypeScript also uses static types to power great editor tooling like auto-completion, code navigation, refactorings, and more."</em> <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-0/">[...]</a>

Senior authors writing this week in the journal Matter are materials chemist and Wearable Electronics Lab director Trisha L. Andrew, with computer scientist Deepak Ganesan and others.

<p><em>"Researchers led by Mathieu Luisier from the Institute for Integrated Systems (IIS) at ETH Zurich and NCCR MARVEL's Director Nicola Marzari at EPFL have set out to develop a comprehensive atlas of 2-D materials that might be capable of challenging currently manufactured silicon-based transistors, so-called Si FinFETs. The new simulations are based on earlier results from Marzari and his team, who used complex simulations on the Swiss National Supercomuting Centre's supercomputer "Piz Daint" to sift through a pool of more than 100,000 materials to identify 1,825 from which it might be possible to obtain 2-D layers of material. The paper 2‑D Materials for Ultrascaled Field-Effect Transistors: One Hundred Candidates under the Ab Initio Microscope, recently published in the journal ACS Nano, identifies 13 particularly promising candidates. The functionality of electronic devices has been growing for more than five decades straight thanks to the continued miniaturization of transistors—the relevant areas of the silicon Finfield-effect transistors (FinFETs) now being produced are no more than a couple of nanometers in any direction. While this miniaturization is driving performance, manufacturing them is extremely difficult and gives rise to strong quantum mechanical effects such as inter/intra-band tunneling that might negatively impact their switching performance. Resulting ultrashort gate lengths also mean that maintaining good electrostatic properties has become difficult, even with multigate architectures."</em> <a href="https://nccr-marvel.ch/highlights/2020-06ACSNano">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A team of international physicists including Jennifer Cano, PhD, of Stony Brook University, has created a new material layered by two structures, forming a superlattice, that at a high temperature is a super-efficient insulator conducting current without dissipation and lost energy. The finding, detailed in a paper published in Nature Physics, could be the basis of research leading to new, better energy efficient electrical conductors. The material is created and developed in a laboratory chamber. Over time atoms attach to it and the material appears to grow – similar to the way rock candy is formed. Surprisingly, it forms a novel ordered superlattice, which the researchers test for quantized electrical transport. The research centers around the Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect (QAHE), which describes an insulator that conducts dissipationless current in discrete channels on its surfaces."</em> <a href="https://news.stonybrook.edu/newsroom/new-superlattice-material-for-future-energy-efficient-devices/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Quantum physicists at Griffith University have unveiled a new paradox that says, when it comes to certain long-held beliefs about nature, “something’s gotta give”. Quantum theory is practically perfect at predicting the behaviour we observe when we perform experiments on tiny objects like atoms. But applying quantum theory at scales much larger than atoms, in particular to observers who make the measurements, raises difficult conceptual issues. In a paper published in Nature Physics, an international team led from Griffith University in Australia has sharpened those issues into a new paradox. “The paradox means that if quantum theory works to describe observers, scientists would have to give up one of three cherished assumptions about the world,” said Associate Professor Eric Cavalcanti, a senior theory author on the paper. “The first assumption is that when a measurement is made, the observed outcome is a real, single event in the world."</em> <a href="https://news.griffith.edu.au/2020/08/18/new-quantum-paradox-reveals-contradiction-between-widely-held-beliefs/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In a step closer to skyscrapers that serve as power sources, a team led by University of Michigan researchers has set a new efficiency record for color-neutral, transparent solar cells. The team achieved 8.1% efficiency and 43.3% transparency with an organic, or carbon-based, design rather than conventional silicon. While the cells have a slight green tint, they are much more like the gray of sunglasses and automobile windows. Windows, which are on the face of every building, are an ideal location for organic solar cells because they offer something silicon can’t, which is a combination of very high efficiency and very high visible transparency “Windows, which are on the face of every building, are an ideal location for organic solar cells because they offer something silicon can’t, which is a combination of very high efficiency and very high visible transparency,” said Stephen Forrest, the Peter A.

Buildings with glass facades typically have a coating on them that reflects and absorbs some of the light, both in the visible and infrared parts of the spectrum, to reduce the brightness and heating inside the building.

<p><em>"Light-emitting diodes, or LEDs, are nearly ubiquitous in modern life, providing the brightness in phone displays, televisions, and lights. A new form of LEDs, made of a class of materials called halide perovskites, promises higher color quality and ease of manufacture, but has been known to fail when subjected to the kind of electrical current typically needed for practical uses. Now, Barry Rand, associate professor of electrical engineering and the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment, and a team of researchers have significantly improved the material’s stability and performance by better managing the heat generated by the LEDs. The research, published in Advanced Materials, identifies several techniques that reduce the accumulation of heat within the material, which extended its lifetime tenfold. When the researchers prevented the device from overheating, they were able to pump enough current into it to produce light hundreds of times more intense than a typical cell phone display. The intensity, measured in watts per square meter, reflects the real amount of light coming from a device, uninfluenced by human eyes or the color of the light."</em> <a href="https://acee.princeton.edu/acee-news/controlling-heat-opens-door-for-next-generation-lighting-and-displays-in-perovskite-leds/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A touch of gold - or another noble metal – can change the structure of a crystal and its intrinsic properties, physicists at the University of Warwick have demonstrated in a display of modern-day alchemy. Scientists from the Department of Physics and WMG at the University of Warwick have found a way to induce electric effects in crystals that they were not previously capable of, such as converting movement or heat into electricity, simply by adding a piece of metal to their surface. Their method is detailed in a new paper published today (19 August) in Nature and demonstrates that the effects can be a greater magnitude than conventionally studied bulky materials making it ideal for use in technologies such as sensors, energy conversion and mobile technologies. The key to the technique is in breaking the symmetry of the crystal’s structure. A crystal can be made from a number of different atoms, but the term describes an ordered structure of particles that form a symmetric pattern. Professor Marin Alexe, co-lead author from the Department of Physics at the University of Warwick, said: “In physics, those materials are rather boring."</em> <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/a_touch_of">[...]</a>

Hundreds of studies have hinted at the power of quantum mechanics, and scientists have predicted quantum technologies will provide a speed boost to computers, beef up cyber security, enhance the resolution of astronomical images and more. For now, however, these applications remain relegated to the realm of theory. While scientists have successfully created quantum systems, they have proven delicate, unstable and frequently finicky. One of the challenges of building useful quantum technologies is that most quantum systems remain operational, or "coherent," for extremely brief periods of time, scientists say.

If scientists can put the brakes on light particles, or photons, it would open the door to a host of new technology applications. Now, in a paper published on Aug. 17, in Nature Nanotechnology, Stanford scientists demonstrate a new approach to slow light significantly, much like an echo chamber holds onto sound, and to direct it at will. Researchers in the lab of Jennifer Dionne, associate professor of materials science and engineering at Stanford, structured ultrathin silicon chips into nanoscale bars to resonantly trap light and then release or redirect it later."</em> <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2020/08/17/slow-light-beam-steering/">[...]</a>

Just as natural rainbows are created by how sunlight plays through water droplets in the atmosphere, we can artificially create our own rainbows using prisms. There are many scientific applications of rainbows, and one is 'Spectrophotometry'! A spectrophotometer is a scientific instrument used to measure how different wavelengths of light (the different colours of light seen in the rainbow are different wavelengths) are absorbed by a sample. This analysis can tell us all sorts of things, and these instruments (first made in the 1940s) have played a huge role in modern science, especially biochemistry.

Similarly, clock signals must be delivered to all parts of the chip to keep it in synchronization. The photo below shows the 8086's die under a microscope.

<p><em>"Hello friends in this post I’ll show how I made my own mini DIY CNC engraving cum Milling machine using Arduino and GRBL CNC shield. The frame of machine is made up of 12mm plywood which is very strong and easy to work with. I have used 500W spindle for this mini cnc engraving machine which have enough power to work done. working area of this machine is 120 x 120 x 30 mm. I have tested this machine on Acrylic sheet, PCB, Wood and works fine. I have not tested with aluminium yet, but yes for shaloow engraving with high quality end mill surely we achieve good result on aluminium as well."</em> <a href="https://electricdiylab.com/diy-cnc-engraving-machine/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"After a long time of just making various project I decided to make an instructable myself. For the first one, I will guide you through process of making your own analog clock made with awesome addressable LED ring. The inner ring shows the hours, outer ring shows minutes and seconds. Beside showing the time, clock can also display the room temperature and it can be a very nice decoration in the room. Every 15 minutes, clock also makes some special effects video shows them all, make sure to check it out. With the help of 2 buttons and potentiometer, user can chose between different mode and modifie colors by his own desire."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/LEDura-Analog-LED-Clock/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A battery powered e-ink display showing the current phase of the moon. I've used this project as a way to learn. It includes my first custom PCB, one of my first 3D prints, my first encounter with open source graphics software and some cobbled together CircuitPython code. I plan to write an update on each of these highlighting what I've learned, in case others want to venture down this torturous path. I'm indebted to NASA for the data and to the fine authors on the Adafruit learning system for showing me how to use it. I really like the aesthetic of three colour e-inks and the idea of low power single purpose displays or indicators."</em> <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/174149-moon-phase-display">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Some time ago I saw a Tweet from the arduino official account talking about an amazing project called "clockception! ", the project seems to be a digital clock created using 24 analog clocks! The video run for a few seconds and I did not have the tech details, but I was amazed! So, I decided to create a new project from scratch inspired in a similar concept and visuals but more colorful using processing and a Raspberry Pi. At first, maybe it's difficult to understand what is "a digital clock formed by 24 analog clocks". A picture is worth a thousand words."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Metaclock/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Do you like gardening but can't find the time to maintain it? Perhaps you have some houseplants that are looking a little thirsty or looking for a way to automate your hydroponics? In this project we will solve those problems and learn the basics of MudPi by building an automated garden system to help take care of things. MudPi is an open source garden system I made to manage and maintain garden resources built on a Raspberry Pi. You can use MudPi for both indoor and outdoor gardening projects scaled to your needs as it is design to be customized. Today we will start with a basic setup I used at home to see how MudPi can be deployed to mange an outdoor garden and control the irrigation."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Automated-Garden-System-Built-on-RaspberryPi-for-O/">[...]</a>
