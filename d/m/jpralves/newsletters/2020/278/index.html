<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1850, o físico italiano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Righi">Augusto Righi</a>. Ele mostrou que as ondas de rádio exibiam características do comportamento das ondas de luz na forma de reflexão, refracção, polarização e interferência. Portanto, a natureza das ondas de rádio era semelhante à luz, mas com a diferença de um comprimento de onda maior e uma parte do mesmo espectro electromagnético da luz. Ele descobriu a histerese magnética (1880). Ele foi a primeira pessoa a gerar micro-ondas e abriu uma área totalmente nova do espectro electromagnético para pesquisa e posterior aplicação. Em 1900 também começou a trabalhar com raios-X. Em 1903, ele escreveu o primeiro artigo sobre telegrafia sem fio. As suas melhorias no trabalho da Hertz foram repassadas para Guglielmo Marconi, que estudou no laboratório de Righi.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1858, o matemático italiano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Peano">Giuseppe Peano</a>. Ele fundou a lógica simbólica. Por meio do uso de símbolos, as equações são mais facilmente compreendidas por qualquer pessoa, independentemente do idioma. Por exemplo, Peano introduziu símbolos para representar "pertence ao conjunto de" e "existe". Em Arithmetics principia (1889), um panfleto que escreveu em latim, Peano publicou a sua primeira versão de um sistema de lógica matemática, dando seus axiomas de Peano definindo os números naturais em termos de conjuntos. Em 1903, Peano propôs sem sucesso uma linguagem internacional artificial que chamou de "Latino sine flexione". Era baseado em latim sem gramática. O seu vocabulário compreendia palavras do inglês, francês, alemão e latim.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1874, o químico industrial alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Bosch">Carl Bosch</a>. Ele foi responsável por, na BASF ter orientado o desenvolvimento do processo em escala industrial para produção de amónia a partir do nitrogénio atmosférico. Em 1908, Fritz Haber, um professor de química sugeriu que os gases de nitrogénio e hidrogénio poderiam ser combinados usando altas temperaturas, alta pressão e catalisadores que resultaram no processo Haber-Bosch. Em 1910, Alwin Mittasch (1869-1953), químico-chefe do laboratório de pesquisa de amónia da BASF, identificou o ferro activado como um catalisador adequado. Bosch supervisionou a criação de novas soluções técnicas para operações de alta pressão. Ele partilhou (com Friedrich Bergius) o Prémio Nobel de Química de 1931 por desenvolver métodos químicos de alta pressão.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1915, o físico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Foster_Ramsey_Jr.">Norman Ramsey</a>. Ele partilhou (com Wolfgang Paul e Hans Georg Dehmelt) o Prémio Nobel de Física em 1989 por "pela invenção do método de campos oscilatórios separados e seu uso no maser de hidrogénio e outros relógios atómicos." O seu trabalho produziu uma maneira mais precisa de observar as transições dentro de um átomo, mudando de um nível específico de energia para outro. No relógio atómico de césio, o seu método permite observar as transições entre dois níveis muito próximos (níveis hiperfinos). A precisão desse relógio é de cerca de uma parte em dez biliões. Em 1967, um segundo foi definido como o tempo durante o qual o átomo de césio faz exactamente 9.192.631.770 oscilações.</p>

<p>E nesta semana que passou foi lançada uma nova versão da distribuição oficial Raspberry Pi OS (anteriormente Raspbian) para Raspberry Pi, a primeira a mudar para a série de Kernel Linux 5.4 LTS. Além da novidade do Kernel esta nova imagem atualiza o Flash Player para a versão mais recente e adicional uma tradução italiana para o desktop PIXEL. Foi também anunciado que estará para breve um versão de 64-bits que tirará melhor partido dos Raspberry PI 4 de 4GB e de 8GB.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou a NASA anunciou que o módulo Lunar que irá ser lançado para a Lua mais concretamente para o seu Polo Sul será transportado pelo foguetão da SpaceX. No início deste ano, a NASA seleccionou a Masten Space Systems para gerir a entrega de oito cargas diferentes ao pólo lunar como parte do programa Artemis da agência projectado para pousar humanos na mesma região em 2024. Masten contratou a SpaceX para lançar seu XL-1 lunar lander para a entrega.</p>

<h2><a href="https://9to5linux.com/raspberry-pi-os-is-now-powered-by-linux-kernel-5-4-lts">Raspberry Pi OS Is Now Powered by Linux Kernel 5.4 LTS</a></h2>

<p><em>"A new version of the official Raspberry Pi OS (formerly Raspbian) distribution for Raspberry Pi computers is now available to download, the first to switch to the Linux 5.4 LTS kernel series. It’s been three months since the Raspberry Pi Foundation announced that their Debian-based Raspbian distribution for Raspberry Pi single-board computer has a new, more appropriate name, Raspberry Pi OS, also unveiling an upcoming 64-bit variant. A new version (2020-08-20) of the Raspberry Pi OS distribution has been released, and while the changes aren’t all that big, it ships with a major kernel bump, namely Linux kernel 5.4 LTS, along with a new Raspberry Pi firmware. Raspbian has been using the long-term supported Linux 4.19 kernel series since June 2019, when the distro was rebased for the first time on the latest Debian GNU/Linux 10 “Buster” operating system series. But it’s time for a new kernel, and Raspberry Pi OS is now powered by Linux kernel 5.4 LTS, which is supported with maintenance updates until the end of year 2025. While not the latest version, Linux kernel 5.4.51 is included in the new Raspberry Pi OS release, which also updates the raspi-config configuration tool to allow users to select the boot EEPROM version and change boot device order."</em> <a href="https://9to5linux.com/raspberry-pi-os-is-now-powered-by-linux-kernel-5-4-lts">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A NASA-contracted lunar lander bound for the moon's South Pole will launch on a SpaceX rocket in late 2022. Earlier this year, NASA selected Masten Space Systems to manage the delivery of eight different payloads to the moon's pole as part of the agency's Artemis program designed to land humans in the same region in 2024. Masten has hired SpaceX to launch its XL-1 lunar lander for the delivery, the company announced on Wednesday (Aug. 26). "Having SpaceX's proven launch success behind us is not only great for us, but it's great for our customers," Masten CEO Sean Mahoney said in a statement. "We share a common vision with SpaceX and that makes this more than a partnership. It's more like a dream team.""</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/masten-hires-spacex-for-moon-launch.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"At TSMC’s annual Technology Symposium, the Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturer detailed characteristics of its future 3nm process node as well as laying out a roadmap for 5nm successors in the form of N5P and N4 process nodes. Starting off with TSMC’s upcoming N5 process node which represents its 2nd generation deep-ultraviolet (DUV) and extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) process node after the rarely used N7+ node (Used by the Kirin 990 SoC for example). TSMC has been in mass production for several months now as we’re expecting silicon shipping to customers at this moment with consumer products shipping this year – Apple’s next-generation SoCs being the likely first candidates for the node. TSMC details that N5 currently is progressing with defect densities one quarter ahead of N7, with the new node having better yields at the time of mass production than both their predecessor major nodes N7 and N10, with a projected defect density that’s supposed to continue to improve past the historic trends of the last two generations. The foundry is preparing a new N5P node that’s based on the current N5 process that extends its performance and power efficiency with a 5% speed gain and a 10% power reduction. Beyond N5P, TSMC is also introducing the N4 node that represents a further evolution from the N5 process, employing further EUV layers to reduce masks, with minimal migration work required by chip designers."</em> <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16024/tsmc-details-3nm-process-technology-details-full-node-scaling-for-2h22">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are a common type of rechargeable batteries. Their versatile nature and numerous applications in all sorts of electronic devices—from mobile phones to cars—makes them seem too good to be true. And perhaps they are: recently, there has been an increase in the number of fire-related incidents associated with LIBs, especially during charging, causing serious concerns over their safety. Scientists now know that these incidents can be due to the use of a broken or unauthorized charger. Often, improper use of these chargers and overcharging can lead to the formation of spiky structures on the negative electrode of the battery, called “lithium (Li) dendrites,” which penetrate through the barrier between the negative and positive electrodes and cause a short circuit. Thus, looking at exactly how dendrite formation occurs is crucial to improving the safety of LIBs."</em> <a href="https://www.okayama-u.ac.jp/eng/research_highlights/index_id111.html">[...]</a>

The practicality of quantum computing hangs on the integrity of the quantum bit, or qubit. Qubits, the logic elements of quantum computers, are coherent two-level systems that represent quantum information. Each qubit has the strange ability to be in a quantum superposition, carrying aspects of both states simultaneously, enabling a quantum version of parallel computation. Quantum computers, if they can be scaled to accommodate many qubits on one processor, could be dizzyingly faster, and able to handle far more complex problems, than today’s conventional computers.

But in the last decade or so, a group led by scientist Federico Capasso at Harvard University has begun to transform the field of optics by engineering flat optics metasurfaces, employing an array of millions of tiny microscopically thin and transparent quartz pillars to diffract and mold the flow of light in much the same way as a glass lens, but without the aberrations that naturally limit the glass.

<p><em>"Super-Kamiokande gets an upgrade to see neutrinos from ancient supernovae The Super-Kamiokande neutrino observatory can detect different kinds of neutrino-related phenomena, including supernova explosions in our own galaxy. It is normally full of pure water, but it has recently received a dose of the rare-earth element gadolinium. This will give the observatory the ability to see supernova explosions in more distant galaxies as well. Buried 1 kilometer underground near the city of Hida in central Japan is an enormous cylinder 40 meters tall and filled with 50 million liters of water. This is the Super-Kamiokande neutrino observatory, and since 1996 it has been observing neutrinos, subatomic particles, from solar, extrasolar, terrestrial and artificial sources. It detects these particles with highly sensitive optical sensors which record minute flashes of light that occur when a neutrino interacts with a molecule of water."</em> <a href="https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/focus/en/press/z0508_00126.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Regardless of what makes up the innards of a quantum computer, its speedy calculations all boil down to sequences of simple instructions applied to qubits—the basic units of information inside a quantum computer. Whether that computer is built from chains of ions, junctions of superconductors, or silicon chips, it turns out that a handful of simple operations, which affect only one or two qubits at a time, can mix and match to create any quantum computer program—a feature that makes a particular handful “universal.” Scientists call these simple operations quantum gates, and they have spent years optimizing the way that gates fit together. They’ve slashed the number of gates (and qubits) required for a given computation and discovered how to do it all while ensuring that errors don’t creep in and cause a failure. Now, researchers at JQI have discovered ways to implement robust, error-resistant gates using just a constant number of simple building blocks—achieving essentially the best reduction possible in a parameter called circuit depth. Their findings, which apply to quantum computers based on topological quantum error correcting codes, were reported in two papers published recently in the journals Physical Review Letters(link is external) and Physical Review B(link is external), and expanded on in a third paper published earlier in the journal Quantum(link is external). Circuit depth counts the number of gates that affect each qubit, and a constant depth means that the number of gates needed for a given operation won’t increase as the computer grows—a necessity if errors are to be kept at bay."</em> <a href="https://jqi.umd.edu/news/quantum-computers-do-instantaneous-twist">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Solar flares emit sudden, strong bursts of electromagnetic radiation from the Sun's surface and its atmosphere, and eject plasma and energetic particles into inter-planetary space. Since large solar flares can cause severe space weather disturbances affecting Earth, to mitigate their impact their occurrence needs to be predicted. However, as the onset mechanism of solar flares is unclear, most flare prediction methods so far have relied on empirical methods. The research team led by Professor Kanya Kusano (Director of the Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research, Nagoya University) recently succeeded in developing the first physics-based model that can accurately predict imminent large solar flares. The work was published in the journal Science on July 31, 2020. The new method of flare prediction, called the kappa scheme, is based on the theory of "double-arc instability," that is a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instability triggered by magnetic reconnection."</em> <a href="http://en.nagoya-u.ac.jp/research/activities/news/2020/08/research-team-develops-the-first-physics-based-method-for-predicting-large-solar-flares.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A novel magnetic tunnel junction, which has four resistance states instead of two states in existing magnetic tunnel junctions, may pave the way to novel spintronics devices, including multi-level magnetic memory. A tunnel junction is a device consisting of two conducting layers separated by an insulating layer. Classically, the resistance for driving current across an insulating layer is infinite; however, when the insulating layer is thin (~ 1-2 nanometers), charge carriers may tunnel through the insulating layer, due to their quantum nature. When the conducting layers are magnetic, a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ), whose resistance depends on the magnetic configurations, is obtained. Current MTJs have only two resistance states as they support either parallel or anti-parallel magnetic configurations of the two magnetic layers. The two-state MTJ has been playing a central role in spintronics, a branch of electronics that uses the magnetic moment associated with the spin of the electron in addition to the electron charge used in traditional electronics."</em> <a href="https://www1.biu.ac.il/indexE.php?id=17250&amp;pt=20&amp;pid=4&amp;level=1&amp;cPath=4&amp;type=1&amp;news=3539">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Like biological fat reserves store energy in animals, a new rechargeable zinc battery integrates into the structure of a robot to provide much more energy, a team led by the University of Michigan has shown. This approach to increasing capacity will be particularly important as robots shrink to the microscale and below—scales at which current stand-alone batteries are too big and inefficient. “Robot designs are restricted by the need for batteries that often occupy 20% or more of the available space inside a robot, or account for a similar proportion of the robot’s weight,” said Nicholas Kotov, the Joseph B. and Florence V. Cejka Professor of Engineering, who led the research. Applications for mobile robots are exploding, from delivery drones and bike-lane take-out bots to robotic nurses and warehouse robots. On the micro side, researchers are exploring swarm robots that can self-assemble into larger devices. Multifunctional structural batteries can potentially free up space and reduce weight, but until now they could only supplement the main battery."</em> <a href="https://news.umich.edu/biomorphic-batteries-could-provide-72x-more-energy-for-robots/">[...]</a>

But in reality, once a powerful laser has been fired, care must be taken to ensure it doesn't get spread too thin. If you've ever pointed a flashlight at a wall, you've observed an example of the diffusion of light. The farther you are from the wall, the more the beam spreads, resulting in a larger and dimmer spot of light. Lasers generally expand much more slowly than the beams from flashlights, but the effect of diffusion is important when the laser travels a long way or must maintain a high intensity.

<p><em>"Boasting the highest melting and boiling points of all known elements, tungsten has become a popular choice for applications involving extreme temperatures, including lightbulb filaments, arc welding, radiation shielding and, more recently, as plasma-facing material in fusion reactors such as the ITER Tokamak. However, tungsten’s inherent brittleness, and the microcracking that occurs while additively manufacturing (3D printing) with the rare metal, has hampered its widespread adoption. To characterize how and why these microcracks form, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) scientists have combined thermomechanical simulations with high-speed videos taken during the laser powder-bed fusion (LPBF) metal 3D printing process. Whereas previous research was limited to examining cracks post-build, scientists for the first time were able to visualize the ductile-to-brittle transition (DBT) in tungsten in real-time, allowing them to observe how microcracks initiated and spread as the metal heated and cooled. The team was able to correlate the microcracking phenomenon with variables such as residual stress, strain rate and temperature, and confirm the DBT caused the cracking. Researchers said the study, recently published in the journal Acta Materialia and featured in the September issue of the prestigious MRS Bulletin, uncovers the fundamental mechanisms behind cracking in 3D-printed tungsten and sets a baseline for future efforts to produce crack-free parts from the metal."</em> <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/news/simulations-high-speed-videos-help-researchers-see-crack-formation-3d-printed-tungsten-real">[...]</a>

Gartner defines edge computing as: “a part of a distributed computing topology in which information processing is located close to the edge — where things and people produce or consume that information.” In other words, edge computing brings computation (and some data storage) closer to the devices where it’s data are being generated or consumed (especially in real-time), rather than relying on a cloud-based central system far away. With this approach, data does not suffer latency issues, reducing the amount of cost in transmission and processing. In a way, it is a kind of “return to the recent past, ” where all the computational work was done locally on a desktop and not in the cloud. Edge computing was developed due to the exponential growth of IoT devices connected to the internet for either receiving information from the cloud or delivering data back to the cloud.

This one uses a Russian-made SMB-20 Geiger tube, driven by a high-voltage step-up circuit robbed from an electronic fly swatter. It detects beta particles and gamma rays, emitting a click for every radioactive particle or gamma ray burst it detects. As you can see in the above video, it clicks every few seconds from background radiation, but really comes to life when radiation sources such as uranium glass, thorium lantern mantles, or americium buttons from smoke detectors are brought near. I built this counter to help me identify radioactive elements that I need to fill out my element collection, and it works great!

Inspired by the classic radiation dosimeters that we have seen in many documentaries and films, the idea of ​​the project is to create a wearable device that allow us to measure the accumulated daily risk of exposure to potentially dangerous environments in relation to the transmission of covid-19. As we know, one of the main transmission factors of covid-19 is the proximity to other people who may be infected by the virus and therefore, one of the objectives to improve prevention is to be in environments where there is a safe distance between people and control the flow of movements around you. The covid-19 personal cumulative risk index tracker is a wireless device that is configured in promiscuous mode, thus acting as an electromagnetic spectrum analyzer at the frequencies used by wireless devices. Actually, almost everyone wears a device with a wireless connection on them, and every device with this type of connection, even if it is not connected to any network or in use, regularly emits a series of beacon signals to identify itself in a unique way. The covid-19 personal cumulative risk index tracker recognizes these signals and their intensity, density and variability, which allow us to know approximately the flow of people around you and based on that information, plus a real-time data of local infection cases, the device creates a reliable daily cumulative index of exposure risk, like the radiation dosimeters."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/ferrithemaker/covid-19-personal-cumulative-risk-index-tracker-624019">[...]</a>

In this project the sensors are used to gain insight about weight distribution."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/Juliette/a-diy-smart-insole-to-check-your-pressure-distribution-a5ceae">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The event that inspired me to start this project was the time when my daughter asked for my help to make some special photos. She isn’t a professional photographer but she is quite passionate about this art form and was looking forward to making some interesting photography. So we mixed my interest in leds with her inclination for taking pictures and created the project you are about to see described. There are already devices that incorporate colorful led lights (pocket rgb led lights) that are available on amazon, for example: AtomCUBE RX1 RGBCW Pocket Light Falcon Eyes F7 12W RGB Led Light Aputure MC Aputure RGB Led Video Light to enumerate just a few. The most useful thing that comes with using this kind of device in my opinion is the fact that you can change through colors slowly or at whatever speed you would like. It’s also amazing that you can control the hue and the saturation of the colors, so you can have an array of styles to choose from."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Build-a-Pocket-RGB-LED-Light-for-Your-Home-Photo-S/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Hello makers in this post we will see how simple you can build a Arduino based digital tachometer or RPM counter You can build this device quickly at home on your own, you only need few components listed below. Arduino Nano ( you can use UNO or Mega as well) IR Sensor module some jumper wires Bread Board 16 x 2 I2C display IR stands for infrared light, its non visible form of light. its wavelength is longer then visible light, so human eyes not able to see Infrared light. Ir sensor module have two IR diode one is transmitting IR light and one is receiving IR light. White surface reflect IR light and black surface absorb IR light. When IR sensor module is powered on IR transmitter emit IR rays if any white object came in front of IR transmitter so IR rays reflect from that body and IR receiver receive this rays and generate a 5V digital output at output pin with the help of LM358 IC."</em> <a href="https://electricdiylab.com/how-to-make-arduino-based-digital-tachometer-or-rpm-counter/">[...]</a>

Using ancient keys to unlock your assets, would now be considered unsafe and boring. Currently, right now, authorities are promoting anything regarding contactless operations to reduce the risk of contracting the virus. This made me question both important aspects of living in a COVID world where economic and health are brought to the question.
