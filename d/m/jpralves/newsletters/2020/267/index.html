<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1842 o químico, engenheiro e inventor alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_von_Linde">Carl von Linde</a>. Foi ele que inventou a refrigeração mecânica. O seu primeiro equipamento de refrigeração foi testado numa cervejaria de Munique. Fabricar cerveja de boa qualidade requeria temperaturas baixas, limitando a fabricação ao inverno ou em porões profundos com o uso de grandes quantidades de gelo em bloco. Com a invenção da refrigeração por Linde, a fabricação de cerveja tornou-se sazonalmente independente. Linde também inventou um processo contínuo de liquefação de gases em grandes quantidades, o que proporcionou ímpeto e meios para a realização de pesquisas científicas a baixas temperaturas e vácuo muito alto.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1967, o físico francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Fabry">Charles Fabry</a>. Ele era especializado em óptica, desenvolvendo métodos para a medição precisa dos efeitos de interferência. Ele trabalhou com Alfred Pérot, durante 1896-1906, no desenho e uso de um dispositivo conhecido como interferometro Fabry-Pérot, especificamente para espectroscopia de alta resolução, composto por duas placas de vidro finamente prateadas colocadas em paralelo, produzindo interferência devido a múltiplas reflexões. Em 1913, Fabry demonstrou que o ozónio é abundante na atmosfera superior e é responsável por filtrar a radiação ultravioleta do Sol, protegendo a vida na superfície da Terra da maioria de seus efeitos nocivos.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1910, o oceanógrafo, biólogo marinho e explorador oceânico <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Cousteau">Jacques Cousteau</a>. Ele ficou conhecido pelas suas extensas investigações nos oceanos. Foi co-inventor do aqualung que tornou possível o mergulho autónomo (1943). Cousteau desenvolveu a série Conshelf de habitats tripulados, o Diving Saucer, um processo de televisão subaquática e várias outras plataformas e instrumentos especializados da ciência do oceano. Em 1945, ele fundou o Grupo de Pesquisa Submarina da Marinha Francesa. Ele modificou um caça-minas de madeira da Segunda Guerra Mundial no navio de pesquisa Calypso, em 1950. Verificou-se que uma cúpula de observação adicionada ao pé do arco de Calypso aumentava a estabilidade, a velocidade e a eficiência de combustível do navio.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1937, o Matemático americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Mumford">David Mumford</a>. Ele recebeu a Medalha Fields em 1974 pelo seu trabalho em geometria algébrica. Nos anos 80, ele voltou-se para a matemática aplicada com a pergunta "Existe uma abordagem matemática para entender o pensamento e o cérebro?" Isso faz parte da "Teoria dos Padrões", apresentada por Ulf Grenander nos anos 70, para fornecer um cenário teórico para um grande número de ideias, técnicas e resultados relacionados a campos como visão computacional, reconhecimento de fala, processamento de imagem e sinal acústico, padrão reconhecimento e seu lado estatístico, redes neuronais e partes da inteligência artificial.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1945, o engenheiro e inventor francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Moreno">Roland Moreno</a>. Ficou conhecido por ter inventado o smart card usado por bancos, supermercados, postos de gasolina, cartões SIM de telefones celulares, cabines telefónicas públicas, documentos de identidade e cartas de condução.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou foi anunciada a nova PS5. A nova consola da Sony virá inicialmente em branco, com pormenores pretos e azul, e vai ter duas versões: uma com suporte para formato físico Ultra HD Blu-ray e outra para formato digital.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos assim como projetos de maker. É apresentada a revista newselectronics de 9 de Junho.</p>

<h2><a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/p4266.html">STMicroelectronics’ Reference Design Enables Compact and Cost-Effective Wearables with Social-Distancing, Contact-Tracing, and Remote Capabilities</a></h2>

<p><em>"STMicroelectronics (NYSE: STM), a global semiconductor leader serving customers across the spectrum of electronics applications, announces the availability of a compact and cost-effective reference design ideally suited for monitoring social distancing, assuring remote operation, provisioning, as well as warning, anti-tampering, and potentially providing contact tracing to protect human health in all environments, including in response to global or local pandemic conditions. Leveraging Bluetooth Low Energy technology through its incorporation of ST’s ultra-low-power BlueNRG-2 System-on-Chip with tunable RF output power, the BlueNRG-Tile reference design measures the signal strength of nearby Bluetooth non-connecting beacons and, in real-time, calculates proximity to these sources. The circuit can be provisioned and then operate, issuing warnings when another beacon intrudes on an adjustable perimeter or when tampered with – even when not connected to a smartphone or 5G network. The base reference design can be supplemented with ST’s S2-LP sub-GHz ultra-low-power RF transceiver to add bi-directional tag-to-cloud communication through the Sigfox “0G” Global Network, allowing private and anonymous tag provisioning, notifications, and an advisory return-channel for emergency warnings. To assure power economy and extend battery lifetime, the ultra-low power components are further enhanced with a MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) accelerometer that power cycles the unit when it isn’t moving. Optionally, internal or external memory could provide long-term storage of nearby beacons, allowing contact tracing."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/p4266.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Toshiba Electronic Devices &amp; Storage Corporation ("Toshiba") has launched two lens reduction type 1,500-pixel monochrome CCD linear image sensors for industrial equipment: “TCD1105GFG,” with a built-in electronic shutter function, and “TCD1106GFG.” Sample shipment will start from July 2020. The new sensors support two key industry requirements: faster operation of equipment that incorporate sensors, including inspection equipment with monochrome CCD linear image sensors; and lower power consumption. The new sensors can be used at a maximum data rate of 25MHz, and both incorporate a timing generator circuit and CCD driver, realizing high-speed operation with few external circuits. A built-in sample and hold circuit lengthens the video output signal period, contributing to easier design for high-speed signal processing. In addition to improved performance, lower power consumption than Toshiba’s current high-speed products is achieved with a single 3.3V power drive.

<h2><a href="https://news.itmo.ru/en/science/photonics/news/9486/">Scientists Create Smallest Semiconductor Laser That Works in Visible Range at Room Temperature</a></h2>

<p><em>"An international team of researchers announced the development of the world’s most compact semiconductor laser that works in the visible range at room temperature. According to the authors of the research, the laser is a nanoparticle of only 310 nanometers in size (which is 3,000 times less than a millimeter) that can produce green coherent light at room temperature. The research article was in ACS Nano. This year, the international community of optical physicists celebrates the anniversary of a milestone event: 60 years ago, in the middle of May, American physicist Theodor Maiman demonstrated the operation of the first optical quantum generator - a laser. This gave way to a new era in which lasers have become an essential part of our lives. Sixty years later, an international team of scientists, most of whom are from ITMO University, published a research where they demonstrated experimentally the world’s most compact semiconductor laser that works in the visible range at room temperature."</em> <a href="https://news.itmo.ru/en/science/photonics/news/9486/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://news.mit.edu/2020/transparent-graphene-electrodes-solar-cells-0605">Transparent graphene electrodes might lead to new generation of solar cells</a></h2>

<p><em>"New roll-to-roll production method could enable lightweight, flexible solar devices and a new generation of display screens. A new way of making large sheets of high-quality, atomically thin graphene could lead to ultra-lightweight, flexible solar cells, and to new classes of light-emitting devices and other thin-film electronics. The new manufacturing process, which was developed at MIT and should be relatively easy to scale up for industrial production, involves an intermediate “buffer” layer of material that is key to the technique’s success. The buffer allows the ultrathin graphene sheet, less than a nanometer (billionth of a meter) thick, to be easily lifted off from its substrate, allowing for rapid roll-to-roll manufacturing. The process is detailed in a paper published yesterday in Advanced Functional Materials, by MIT postdocs Giovanni Azzellino and Mahdi Tavakoli; professors Jing Kong, Tomas Palacios, and Markus Buehler; and five others at MIT. Finding a way to make thin, large-area, transparent electrodes that are stable in open air has been a major quest in thin-film electronics in recent years, for a variety of applications in optoelectronic devices — things that either emit light, like computer and smartphone screens, or harvest it, like solar cells."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2020/transparent-graphene-electrodes-solar-cells-0605">[...]</a>

<p><em>"An investigation into one of the current great mysteries of astronomy has come to the fore thanks to a four-year observing campaign conducted at the Jodrell Bank Observatory. Using the long-term monitoring capabilities of the iconic Lovell Telescope, an international team led by Jodrell Bank astronomers has been studying an object known as a repeating Fast Radio Burst (FRB), which emits very short duration bright radio pulses. Using the 32 bursts discovered during the campaign, in conjunction with data from previously published observations, the team has discovered that emission from the FRB known as 121102 follows a cyclic pattern, with radio bursts observed in a window lasting approximately 90 days followed by a silent period of 67 days. The same behaviour then repeats every 157 days. This discovery provides an important clue to identifying the origin of these enigmatic fast radio bursts. The presence of a regular sequence in the burst activity could imply that the powerful bursts are linked to the orbital motion of a massive star, a neutron star or a black hole."</em> <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/jodrell-bank-leads-international-effort-which-reveals-157-day-cycle-in-unusual-cosmic-radio-bursts/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Group of scientists from NUST MISIS developed a ceramic material with the highest melting point among currently known compounds. Due to the unique combination of physical, mechanical and thermal properties, the material is promising for use in the most heat-loaded components of aircraft, such as nose fairings, jet engines and sharp front edges of wings operating at temperatures above 2000 °C. The results are published in Ceramics International. The active development of the aerospace industry requires more and more for aircraft: it must be fast, wear-resistant, and cheaper in production. Many leading space agencies (NASA, ESA, as well as agencies of Japan, China and India) are actively developing such reusable aircraft, spaceplanes, the use of which will significantly reduce the cost of delivering people and cargo to orbit, as well as reduce the time intervals between flights. “Currently, significant results have been achieved in the development of such devices."</em> <a href="https://en.misis.ru/university/news/science/2020-05/6648/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.llnl.gov/news/checking-out-iron-under-pressure">Checking out iron under pressure</a></h2>

<p><em>"Iron is the most stable and heaviest chemical element produced by nucleosynthesis in stars, making it the most abundant heavy element in the universe and in the interiors of Earth and other rocky planets. To get a better understanding of the high-pressure behavior of iron, a Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) physicist and international collaborators discovered the subnanosecond phase transitions in laser-shocked iron. The research appears in the June 5 edition of the journal Science Advances. The research could help scientists better understand the physics, chemistry and the magnetic properties of Earth and other planets by measuring time-resolved high-resolution X-ray diffractions for the entire duration of shock compression. This allows observation of the timing of the onset of elastic compression at 250 picoseconds and the inferred observation of three-wave structures between 300-600 picoseconds. The X-ray diffraction reveals that the famous phase transformation from ambient iron (Fe) to high pressure Fe occurs within 50 picoseconds."</em> <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/news/checking-out-iron-under-pressure">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/broadcast/read/52210">How magnetic fields and 3D printers will create the pills of tomorrow</a></h2>

<p><em>"Doctors could soon be administering an entire course of treatment for life-threatening conditions with a 3D printed capsule controlled by magnetic fields thanks to advances made by University of Sussex researchers. Engineers and pharmaceutical scientists from the University of Sussex and the University of Texas at Austin have developed a triggerable and remotely controllable system for on-demand drug delivery. Using 3D printing technology and magnetic actuation, researchers have been able to prove the concept of a drug release triggered by magnetic fields capable of inhibiting the proliferation of cancer cells in vitro. While the research is in its initial phases, the researchers are working towards a system where it is possible to drive the drug delivery system towards the required position in the body using external means such as permanent magnets. The technology would allow for a drug to be applied close to the lesion. The researchers foresee that the targeted delivery offered by the new system could help eliminate harmful side effects caused by treatments like chemotherapy which damage neighbouring healthy cells."</em> <a href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/broadcast/read/52210">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The design could advance the development of small, portable AI devices. MIT engineers have designed a “brain-on-a-chip,” smaller than a piece of confetti, that is made from tens of thousands of artificial brain synapses known as memristors — silicon-based components that mimic the information-transmitting synapses in the human brain. The researchers borrowed from principles of metallurgy to fabricate each memristor from alloys of silver and copper, along with silicon. When they ran the chip through several visual tasks, the chip was able to “remember” stored images and reproduce them many times over, in versions that were crisper and cleaner compared with existing memristor designs made with unalloyed elements. Their results, published today in the journal Nature Nanotechnology, demonstrate a promising new memristor design for neuromorphic devices — electronics that are based on a new type of circuit that processes information in a way that mimics the brain’s neural architecture. Such brain-inspired circuits could be built into small, portable devices, and would carry out complex computational tasks that only today’s supercomputers can handle."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2020/thousands-artificial-brain-synapses-single-chip-0608">[...]</a>

In 1965, Intel co-founder Gordon Moore predicted that the number of transistors that could fit on a computer chip would grow exponentially — and they did, doubling about every two years. For half a century, Moore’s Law has endured: Computers have gotten smaller, faster, cheaper, and more efficient, enabling the rapid worldwide adoption of PCs, smartphones, high-speed internet, and more. This miniaturization trend has led to silicon chips today that have almost unimaginably small circuitry. Transistors, the tiny switches that implement computer microprocessors, are so small that 1,000 of them laid end-to-end are no wider than a human hair.

A new study that demonstrates how a modified 3D-printing process provides a versatile approach to producing multiple colors from a single ink is published in the journal Science Advances. Some of the most vibrant colors in nature come from a nanoscale phenomenon called structural coloration. When light rays reflect off these periodically placed structures located in the wings and skins of some animals and within some minerals, they constructively interfere with each other to amplify certain wavelengths and suppress others. When the structures are well ordered and small enough – about a thousand times smaller than a human hair, the researchers said – the rays produce a vivid burst of color. “It is challenging to reproduce these vibrant colors in the polymers used to produce items like environmentally friendly paints and highly selective optical filters,” said study leader Ying Diao, a chemical and biomolecular engineering professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign."</em> <a href="https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/809468">[...]</a>

The equipment for this receiver system is located a small building in the middle of mosquito and deer-fly infested range land near brackish marshes - no-where that anyone in their right mind would like to be during most of the year. With the normal weather in the summer and many clear days, this building gets hot at times: It's been observed to exceed 130F (55C) on the hottest days inside - a temperature that causes the fans on the computers scream! Even though electronic equipment is best kept at much lower temperatures, this isn't practical in this building as it would be prohibitively expensive to run the on-site air conditioner full time - but all we really need to do is to keep the building closer to the outside temperature and even though it may be uncomfortable for humans, it is enough to keep the electronics happy. To that end, vents have recently been installed to allow convection to pull away most of the heat and the exterior will soon been painted with white "RV" paint to (hopefully) reduce the heating effects of direct sun. It would make sense, then, that we had a way to remotely monitor the building's internal temperature as a means of monitoring the situation."</em> <a href="https://ka7oei.blogspot.com/2020/06/an-esp8266-based-temperature-humidity.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The objective of this project is to measure air quality by measuring the quantity of fine particles. Thanks to its portability, it will be possible to carry out measurements at home or on the move. Air quality and fine particles: Particulate matter (PM) is generally defined as fine solid particles carried by the air (source: Wikipedia). Fine particles penetrate deep into the lungs. They can cause inflammation and worsen the health of people with heart and lung disease. The writing device measures the presence rate of PM10 and PM2.5 particles The writing device shall measure the presence of PM10 and PM2,5 The term "PM10" refers to particles with a diameter of less than 10 micrometers."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Portable-Fine-Particle-Measurement/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Turn an old 3D printer into a CNC machine Well yesBut there are issues I made a video sponsored by Banggood who have given me a $100 CNC spindle and some tooling to try and make my old Prusa i3 3D printer into a CNC. The 3D printer Ive a few years now just sitting in the shedas I have my nice Lulzbot Taz 3 so its about time I gave it a new lease of life. It was a good printer for its time and as I built it myself Im very familiar with the design so itll lend itself perfectly to this project. My first thought as Im sure many have considered before, there isnt much difference between a 3D printer and a small CNC machine. They typically both have small stepper motors that drive a tool end of some kind along several axis to reproduce a digital file. 3D printers do additive manufacturing using a plastic extruder usually and CNC machines a rotary cutting tool to do subtractive manufacturing by carving away the unwanted material."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Turn-an-Old-3D-Printer-Into-a-CNC-Machine/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Intro: Simple to control, easy to program, and essentially immortalized by the Nokia 6110, Snake has become a favorite project among engineers. Its been implemented in anything from LED matrices, LCDs, bookshelf lighting, and even windows of entire buildings. We'll be implementing Snake on a tiny breadboard. People have certainly made tinier snake players, but this specifically uses a breadboard, removing the need to design PCBs or solder. (You could just make an app on your phone, but we don't do things because they're easy.) Prerequisites: A basic understanding of circuits, how to breadboard, and a solid grasp of programming in Arduino."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Snake-on-a-Tiny-Breadboard/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Yeah, I've really done that. It was hard, took me several days but I made it. In the end, it was an excellent experience and the most amazing thing is that Freeduino (that is how I call it) actually works. And I would like to share my experience with you. What is Freeduino? It's a famous Arduino UNO board made without any circuit board."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/See-Through-Arduino-UNO/">[...]</a>
