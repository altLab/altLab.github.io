<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1925, o Matemático britânico nascido na Alemanha <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Roth">Klaus Friedrich Roth</a>. O seu principal trabalho tem sido a teoria dos números, particularmente a teoria analítica dos números. Ele resolveu no famoso problema de Thue-Siegel relativo à aproximação de números algébricos por números racionais (pelo qual ganhou a medalha Fiels). Roth também provou em 1952 que uma sequência sem três números na progressão aritmética tem densidade zero (uma conjectura de Erdös e Turán de 1935).</p>

<p>Em 1991, a sonda espacial Galileo tornou-se o primeiro objecto humano a voar além de um asteróide, Gaspra, fazendo a sua maior aproximação a uma distância de 1.604 km, passando a uma velocidade de 8 km/s. O encontro forneceu muitos dados, incluindo 150 imagens, que mostraram que Gaspra tem numerosas crateras indicando que sofreu inúmeras colisões desde a sua formação. Gaspra tem cerca de 20 km de comprimento e orbita o Sol no cinturão de asteróides principal entre Marte e Júpiter. Gaspra, asteróide 951, foi descoberto pelo astrónomo ucraniano Grigoriy N. Neujamin, que o nomeou após um retiro no Mar Negro.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou foi lançada a nova versão da distribuição de Linux do projecto Fedora. O Fedora 33 tem como principais novidades o GNOME 3.38, a swap on z-ram (Swap comprimida em RAM) e o filesystem BTRFS por omissão. Além destas alterações, esta distro inclui o Python 3.9, o Java 11, o Perl 5.32, a Glibc 2.32, o LLVM 11 entre outros. A variante Fedora IoT passou a ser uma versão oficial e suportada. Os pacotes passaram a ser compilados com a optimização LTO (Link-time Optimizations) que irá igualmente aumentar o desempenho das aplicações.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou o sistema SOFIA (Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy) da NASA confirmou, pela primeira vez, a água na superfície da lua iluminada pelo sol. Esta descoberta indica que a água pode estar distribuída pela superfície lunar, e não limitada a lugares frios e escuros.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos assim como projetos de maker. São apresentadas as revistas MagPI Nº99 de Novembro e as revistas neweletronics de 26 e 27 de Outubro. É igualmente apresentado o livro "Create Graphical User Interfaces with Python".</p>

<p><em>"NASA’s Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) has confirmed, for the first time, water on the sunlit surface of the Moon. This discovery indicates that water may be distributed across the lunar surface, and not limited to cold, shadowed places. SOFIA has detected water molecules (H2O) in Clavius Crater, one of the largest craters visible from Earth, located in the Moon’s southern hemisphere. Previous observations of the Moon’s surface detected some form of hydrogen, but were unable to distinguish between water and its close chemical relative, hydroxyl (OH). Data from this location reveal water in concentrations of 100 to 412 parts per million – roughly equivalent to a 12-ounce bottle of water – trapped in a cubic meter of soil spread across the lunar surface. The results are published in the latest issue of Nature Astronomy."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-sofia-discovers-water-on-sunlit-surface-of-moon/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"As ubiquitous as artificial intelligence has become in modern life — from boosting our understanding of the cosmos to surfacing entertaining videos on your phone — AI hasn’t yet found its way into orbit. That is until Sept. 2, when an experimental satellite about the size of a cereal box was ejected from a rocket’s dispenser along with 45 other similarly small satellites. The satellite, named PhiSat-1, is now soaring at over 17,000 mph (27,500 kmh) in sun-synchronous orbit about 329 miles (530 km) overhead. PhiSat-1 contains a new hyperspectral-thermal camera and onboard AI processing thanks to an Intel® Movidius™ Myriad™ 2 Vision Processing Unit (VPU) — the same chip inside many smart cameras and even a $99 selfie drone here on Earth. PhiSat-1 is actually one of a pair of satellites on a mission to monitor polar ice and soil moisture, while also testing intersatellite communication systems in order to create a future network of federated satellites. The first problem the Myriad 2 is helping to solve?"</em> <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news/intel-powers-first-satellite-ai/">[...]</a>

Like Earth, Titan has a thick atmosphere that acts as a protective shield from meteoroids; meanwhile, erosion and other geologic processes efficiently erase craters made by meteoroids that do reach the surface. The result is far fewer impacts and craters than on other moons. Even so, because impacts stir up what lies beneath and expose it, Titan's impact craters reveal a lot.

Hydrogen is likely to play a key role in the clean transition away from fossil fuels and other processes that produce greenhouse gas emissions.

Only a few gas-phase studies have been achieved for experimental characterization of water octamer, and two nearly isoenergetic structures with D2d and S4 symmetry are found.

<p><em>"Researchers at National University of Science and Technology MISIS (NUST MISIS) have managed to develop a unique method to process bulk metallic glasses. According to the authors of the study, they have managed to find processing conditions that significantly improve the quality of this promising material. The research results were published in Journal of Alloys and Compounds. Metallic glasses (amorphous metals) are materials which, unlike crystalline forms, don’t have a long range atomic order. According to the scientists, this makes the material high-strength, elastic, corrosion resistant; amorphous metals also have other useful properties, due to which they are in demand in instrument making, mechanical engineering, medicine and magneto-electrical engineering. NUST MISIS scientists explained that the material’s brittleness is one of the obstacles to its widespread use."</em> <a href="https://en.misis.ru/university/news/science/2020-10/7034/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A new method for verifying a widely held but unproven theoretical explanation of the formation of stars and planets has been proposed by researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL). The method grows from simulation of the Princeton Magnetorotational Instability (MRI) Experiment, a unique laboratory device that aims to demonstrate the MRI process that is believed to have filled the cosmos with celestial bodies. Cosmic dust The novel device, designed to duplicate the process that causes swirling clouds of cosmic dust and plasma(link is external) to collapse into stars and planets, consists of two fluid-filled concentric cylinders that rotate at different speeds. The device seeks to replicate the instabilities that are thought to cause the swirling clouds to gradually shed what is called their angular momentum and collapse into the growing bodies that they orbit. Such momentum keeps the Earth and other planets firmly within their orbits. “In our simulations we can actually see the MRI develop in experiments,” said Himawan Winarto, a graduate student in the Princeton Program in Plasma Physics at PPPL and lead author of a paper in Physical Review E(link is external) that reports the findings."</em> <a href="https://www.pppl.gov/news/2020/10/exploring-source-stars-and-planets-laboratory">[...]</a>

For over a century, scientists have been puzzled by the electrification of water when it is brought in contact with water-repellent or “hydrophobic” materials, such as paraffin wax, oils, air bubbles and perfluorinated membranes and sheets. Underlying mechanisms remain hotly debated. Now, a team of KAUST engineers has untangled the roles of water, hydrophobicity and environmental factors in this process.

<p><em>"A spot of pressure enables chemical conversion to hardened 2D material Marrying two layers of graphene is an easy route to the blissful formation of nanoscale diamond, but sometimes thicker is better. While it may only take a bit of heat to turn a treated bilayer of the ultrathin material into a cubic lattice of diamane, a bit of pressure in just the right place can convert few-layer graphene as well. The otherwise chemically driven process is theoretically possible according to scientists at Rice University, who published their most recent thoughts on making high-quality diamane — the 2D form of diamond — in the journal Small. The research led by materials theorist Boris Yakobson and his colleagues at Rice’s Brown School of Engineering suggests a pinpoint of pressure on few-layer graphene, the atom-thin form of carbon known for its astonishing strength, can nucleate a surface chemical reaction with hydrogen or fluorine. From there, the diamondlike lattice should propagate throughout the material as atoms of hydrogen or fluorine alight on the top and bottom and covalently bind to the surfaces, prompting carbon-carbon connections between the layers. The pressure applied to that one spot — as small as a few nanometers – is entirely unnecessary for a bilayer but is needed and must be progressively stronger for thicker films, Yakobson said."</em> <a href="https://news.rice.edu/2020/10/29/rice-finds-path-to-nanodiamond-from-graphene-2/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A team of Australian quantum theorists has shown how to break a bound that had been believed, for 60 years, to fundamentally limit the coherence of lasers. The coherence of a laser beam can be thought of as the number of photons (particles of light) emitted consecutively into the beam with the same phase (all waving together). It determines how well it can perform a wide variety of precision tasks, such as controlling all the components of a quantum computer. Now, in a paper published in Nature Physics, the researchers from Griffith University and Macquarie University have shown that new quantum technologies open the possibility of making this coherence vastly larger than was thought possible. “The conventional wisdom dates back to a famous 1958 paper by American physicists Arthur Schawlow and Charles Townes,” said Professor Howard Wiseman, project leader and Director of Griffith’s Centre for Quantum Dynamics. Each of them went on to win a Nobel prize for their laser work."</em> <a href="https://news.griffith.edu.au/2020/10/27/60-year-old-limit-to-lasers-overturned-by-quantum-researchers/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Quantum dot logic circuits provide the long-sought building blocks for innovative devices, including printable electronics, flexible displays, and medical diagnostics Researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory and their collaborators from the University of California, Irvine have created fundamental electronic building blocks out of tiny structures known as quantum dots and used them to assemble functional logic circuits. The innovation promises a cheaper and manufacturing-friendly approach to complex electronic devices that can be fabricated in a chemistry laboratory via simple, solution-based techniques, and offer long-sought components for a host of innovative devices. “Potential applications of the new approach to electronic devices based on non-toxic quantum dots include printable circuits, flexible displays, lab-on-a-chip diagnostics, wearable devices, medical testing, smart implants, and biometrics,” said Victor Klimov, a physicist specializing in semiconductor nanocrystals at Los Alamos and lead author on a paper announcing the new results in the October 19 issue of Nature Communications. For decades, microelectronics has relied on extra-high purity silicon processed in a specially created clean-room environment. Recently, silicon-based microelectronics has been challenged by several alternative technologies that allow for fabricating complex electronic circuits outside a clean room, via inexpensive, readily accessible chemical techniques. Colloidal semiconductor nanoparticles made with chemistry methods in much less stringent environments are one such emerging technology."</em> <a href="https://www.lanl.gov/discover/news-release-archive/2020/October/1029-quantum-dot-transistors.php?source=newsroom-topnews-box">[...]</a>

By using the right technology we no longer have to depend on our general routine health check-up or our local physicians to assess our body. Sensors can be used to measure all your body vitals and this information can be shared remotely in real-time for a doctor from other parts of the world to diagnosis you or perhaps an AI could crunch all the numbers and diagnosis your problem. Sounds futuristic, right? But we are gradually moving towards it and we are not very far from having remote IoT Robotic Arms performing surgery on us.
