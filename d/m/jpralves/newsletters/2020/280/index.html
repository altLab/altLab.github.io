<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1775, o químico e médico inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kidd_(chemist)">John Kidd</a>. Ele conseguiu obter o naftaleno em 1819, nome que ele cunhou. Foi o primeiro de muitos produtos químicos orgânicos úteis derivados do alcatrão de carvão, o líquido preto espesso resultante do aquecimento do carvão para produzir coque e gás.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1839, o matemático, lógico e filósofo americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce">Charles Sanders Peirce</a>. Ele destacou-se pelo seu trabalho sobre a lógica das relações e sobre o pragmatismo como método de pesquisa. Ele foi o primeiro psicólogo experimental moderno nas Américas, o primeiro metrologista a usar um comprimento de onda de luz como unidade de medida, o inventor da projecção quincuncial da esfera, o primeiro criador conhecido do projecto e teoria de um computador de circuito de comutação eléctrico e o fundador da "economia da pesquisa". Ele é o único filósofo construtor de sistemas nas Américas que foi competente e produtivo em lógica, matemática e numa ampla gama de ciências. Ele era filho do matemático de Harvard Benjamin Peirce.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1857, o astrónomo americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Edward_Keeler">James Edward Keeler</a>. Ele confirmou a teoria de Maxwell de que os anéis de Saturno não eram sólidos (exigindo rotação uniforme), mas compostos de partículas meteóricas (com velocidade de rotação dada pela 3ª lei de Kepler). O seu espectro-grama de 9 de Abril de 1895 dos anéis de Saturno mostrou o deslocamento Doppler indicando a variação da velocidade radial ao longo da fenda. Aos 21 anos, ele observou o eclipse solar de Julho de 1878, com a expedição do Observatório Naval ao Colorado.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1892, o físico americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Compton">Arthur Compton</a>. Ele foi um dos vencedores com C.T.R. Wilson da Inglaterra, do Prémio Nobel de Física (1927) pela sua descoberta e explicação da mudança no comprimento de onda dos raios X quando eles colidem com electrões em metais. Este efeito chamado de efeito Compton é causado pela transferência de energia de um fotão para um único electrão, então um quantum de radiação é re-emitido numa direcção definida pelo electrão, que ao fazer isso deve recuar numa direcção formando um ângulo com o da radiação incidente.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1898, o engenheiro químico americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldo_Semon">Waldo Semon</a>. Ele inventou o PVC plastificado (vinil). Em 1926, ele descobriu como converter cloreto de polivinila de uma substância dura e impraticável numa flexível. Agora é usado em centenas de produtos, como ladrilhos, mangueiras de jardim, imitações de couro, cortinas de casa de banho e revestimentos. É produzido em quantidades maiores do que qualquer outro plástico, com excepção do polietileno. Semon também fez contribuições pioneiras na ciência dos polímeros, incluindo novos anti-oxidantes da borracha. A sua liderança técnica levou à descoberta de três novas famílias de polímeros importantes: poliuretano termoplástico, borracha "natural" sintética e borrachas sintéticas resistentes a óleo.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1948, o arquitecto de software hungaro-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Simonyi">Charles Simonyi</a>. Ele é responsável pela criação da notação húngara que é uma convenção de nomenclatura de identificador em programação de computadores, na qual o nome de uma variável ou função indica sua intenção ou classe e, em alguns dialectos, o seu tipo. Ele também é responsável pela criação do paradigma da programação intencional. Este paradigma codifica no código-fonte do software a intenção precisa que os programadores (ou utilizadores) têm em mente ao conceber o seu trabalho. Usando o nível apropriado de abstracção no qual o programador está a pensar, a criação e manutenção de programas de computador torna-se mais fácil. Separando as preocupações com as intenções e como elas estão a ser operadas, o software torna-se mais modular e permite códigos de software mais reutilizáveis.</p>

<p>Em 2008 era ligado pela primeira vez o LHC - Large Hadron Collider. Depois de uma construção que durou a volta de 10 anos foi ligado e o primeiro feixe circulou através do collider na manhã de 10 de Setembro. O CERN disparou com sucesso os protões a volta do túnel em estágios, três quilómetros de cada vez. As partículas foram disparadas no sentido horário no acelerador e contornadas com sucesso às 10:28, horário local. O LHC completou com sucesso seu principal teste: depois de uma série de testes, dois pontos brancos brilharam no ecrã do computador, mostrando que os protões percorreram todo o comprimento do collider. Demorou menos de uma hora para guiar o fluxo de partículas em torno do seu circuito inaugural. De seguida, o CERN enviou com sucesso um feixe de protões no sentido contrário aos ponteiros do relógio, demorando um pouco mais de uma hora e meia devido a um problema com a criogenia, com o circuito completo a ser concluído às 14h59.</p>

<p><em>"There is expected to be more than 79 zettabytes of IoT data in 2025, but the real value of this data is found in the insights it generates. The closer to the data source we can produce these insights the better, because of the improved security, latency and energy efficiency enabled. Computational storage is emerging as a critical piece of the data storage puzzle because it puts processing power directly on the storage device, giving companies secure, quick and easy access to vital information. Our expertise and legacy in storage puts Arm in a strong position to address the changing needs of this market – with around 85% of hard disk drive controllers and solid-state drive controllers based on Arm, we are already a trusted partner for billions of storage devices. Today, we’re announcing Arm Cortex-R82, our first 64-bit, Linux-capable Cortex-R processor designed to accelerate the development and deployment of next-generation enterprise and computational storage solutions. Generating insight where data is stored For processing to take place closer to the data, we needed to deliver higher performance."</em> <a href="https://www.arm.com/company/news/2020/09/highest-performance-arm-cortex-r-processor">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Apple’s iPad 2 launch in 2011 ignited a touch tablet craze, but when David Cann and Marc DeVidts got their hands on one they saw something different: They rigged it to a remote-controlled golf caddy and posted a video of it in action on YouTube. Next came phone calls from those interested in buying such a telepresence robot. Hacks like this were second nature for the friends who met in 2002 while working on the set of the BattleBots TV series, featuring team-built robots battling before live audiences. That’s how Double Robotics began in 2012. The startup went on to attend YCombinator’s accelerator, and it has sold more than 12,000 units. That cash flow has allowed the small team with just $1.8 million in seed funding to carry on without raising capital, a rarity in hardware."</em> <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/09/08/jetson-driven-double-robot-supports-remote-working/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"High-Speed, Low-Power Data Buffer Delivers Improved Speed and Bandwidth for DDR5 DRAM and Storage Class Memory Modules. Renesas Electronics Corporation (TSE:6723), a premier supplier of advanced semiconductor solutions and the industry leader in memory interface products, today announced a new high-speed, low-power DDR5 data buffer for data center, server, and high-performance workstation applications. Advancements over the past few years in real-time analytics, machine learning, HPC, AI, and other memory and bandwidth-hungry applications have fueled explosive growth in server memory bandwidth requirements. The new JEDEC-compliant DDR5 data buffer 5DB0148 from Renesas enables significantly higher speeds and lower latency for load-reduced dual inline memory modules (LRDIMMs) that have become the cornerstone memory technology for this new class of applications. The first generation of DDR5 LRDIMMs based on Renesas components enable a bandwidth increase of more than 35 percent over DDR4 LRDIMMs operating at 3200 MT/s. “As the industry’s complete DDR5 solution provider, we are working closely with customers and ecosystem partners to launch a vastly expanded portfolio of memory solutions into production,” said Rami Sethi, Vice President, Data Center Business Division at Renesas."</em> <a href="https://www.renesas.com/eu/en/about/press-center/news/2020/news20200909.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"University of Copenhagen physicists, as part of the University and Microsoft collaboration focused on topological quantum computing, may have unloosed a Gordian knot in quantum computer development. In partnership with researchers from University of Chicago, ETH Zurich, Weizmann Institute of Science, and fellow Microsoft Quantum Lab collaborators at Purdue University, they have designed and realized a promising building block for supercomputers of the future: a two-dimensional platform for that could lead to quantum bits that are both stable and able to be mass produced. Led by two young physicists, Antonio Fornieri and Alex Whiticar, under the supervision of Professor Charles Marcus, Director of Microsoft Quantum Lab Copenhagen, researchers at the Center for Quantum Devices (QDev) a Center of Excellence sponsored by the Danish National Research Foundation at the Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, designed, built, and characterized a key component that could cut a Gordian knot in the development of viable quantum computers - specifically, the building block for a quantum bit, or qubit, that is both protected from disturbances and able to be mass produced. Their results have just been published in the scientific journal, Nature. Together with a back-to-back publication from a team at Harvard University on a related system, the Copenhagen team was able to demonstrate Majorana zero modes in the one-dimensional semiconductor gap between two superconductors forming a spatially extended Josephson junction, an effect predicted theoretically by teams at Harvard-Weizmann, and Niels Bohr Institute-Lund University. The wide Josephson junction is part of a complex chip of hybrid superconductor and semiconductor materials grown by Michael Manfra’s Microsoft Quantum Lab group at Purdue."</em> <a href="https://www.science.ku.dk/english/press/news/2019/ucph-researchers-design-potentially-perfect-platform-for-quantum-computer-of-the-future/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"By accounting for inertial forces, the new design can reduce the metabolic energy required by the user For backpackers, it’s a treat to escape civilization and traverse through the woods, enjoying the ruggedness of the great outdoors. But carrying that heavy backpack for days can undoubtedly be a drag. One group of researchers in China has some welcome news: an invention aimed at lightening the load. They’ve designed a new backpack that accounts for the inertial forces of the bag against a backpacker’s body as the person walks, reducing the metabolic energy demand on the user by an average of 11 percent. Their design is described in a study published 27 July in IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering. Caihua Xiong, a professor at Huazhong University of Science and Technology who was involved in the study, notes that humans around the world and across the ages have been exploring ways to lighten their loads."</em> <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/consumer-electronics/portable-devices/this-motorized-backpack-eases-the-burden-for-hikers">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Physicists from MIPT and the Russian Quantum Center, joined by colleagues from Saratov State University and Michigan Technological University, have demonstrated new methods for controlling spin waves in nanostructured bismuth iron garnet films via short laser pulses. Presented in Nano Letters, the solution has potential for applications in energy-efficient information transfer and spin-based quantum computing. A particle’s spin is its intrinsic angular momentum, which always has a direction. In magnetized materials, the spins all point in one direction. A local disruption of this magnetic order is accompanied by the propagation of spin waves, whose quanta are known as magnons. Unlike the electrical current, spin wave propagation does not involve a transfer of matter."</em> <a href="https://mipt.ru/english/news/physicists_achieve_tunable_spin_wave_excitation?sphrase_id=426417">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In physics, it is essential to be able to show a theoretical assumption in actual, physical experiments. For more than a hundred years, physicists have been aware of the link between the concepts of disorder in a system, and information obtained by measurement. However, a clean experimental assessment of this link in common monitored systems, that is systems which are continuously measured over time, was missing so far. But now, using a “quantum drum”, a vibrating, mechanical membrane, researchers have realized an experimental setup that shows the physical interplay between the disorder and the outcomes of a measurement. A collaboration of experimentalists from the Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen and theorists at Queen’s University Belfast, and the University of Sao Palo, could show how to extract order from this largely disordered system, providing a general tool to engineer the state of the system, essential for future quantum technologies, like quantum computers. The result is now published in as an Editors’ Suggestion in Physical Review Letters."</em> <a href="https://www.nbi.ku.dk/english/news/news20/extracting-order-from-a-quantum-measurement-shown-experimentally-for-the-first-time/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Sensitive force measurements made with submillimeter-sized device could be useful for manipulating small objects or measuring liquid surface tension. Researchers have developed a tiny fiber optic force sensor that can measure extremely slight forces exerted by small objects. The new light-based sensor overcomes the limitations of force sensors based on micro-electro-mechanical sensors (MEMS) and could be useful for applications from medical systems to manufacturing. “Applications for force sensing are numerous, but there is a lack of thoroughly miniature and versatile force sensors that can perform force measurements on small objects,” said research team leader Denis Donlagic from the University of Maribor in Slovenia. “Our sensor helps meet this need as one of the smallest and most versatile optical-fiber force sensors designed thus far.” In The Optical Society (OSA) journal Optics Letters, Donlagic and Simon Pevec describe their new sensor, which is made of silica glass formed into a cylinder just 800 microns long and 100 microns in diameter — roughly the same diameter as a human hair. They demonstrate the new sensor’s ability to measure force with a resolution better than a micronewton by using it to measure the stiffness of a dandelion seed or the surface tension of a liquid."</em> <a href="https://www.osa.org/en-us/about_osa/newsroom/news_releases/2020/researchers_make_tiny_yet_complex_fiber_optic_forc/">[...]</a>

At the heart of the superconducting quantum interference device are two atomically thin layers of graphene, which the researchers combined with boron nitride. Instruments like this one have applications in areas such as medicine, besides being used to research new materials. To measure very small magnetic fields, researchers often use superconducting quantum interference devices, or SQUIDs. In medicine, their uses include monitoring brain or heart activity, for example, while in the earth sciences researchers use SQUIDs to characterize the composition of rocks or detect groundwater flows. The devices also have a broad range of uses in other applied fields and basic research."</em> <a href="https://www.unibas.ch/en/News-Events/News/Uni-Research/A-tiny-instrument-to-measure-the-faintest-magnetic-fields.html">[...]</a>

Managing the heat generated in electronics is a huge problem, especially with the constant push to reduce the size and pack as many transistors as possible in the same chip. The whole problem is how to manage such high heat fluxes efficiently. Usually electronic technologies, designed by electrical engineers, and cooling systems, designed by mechanical engineers, are done independently and separately. But now EPFL researchers have quietly revolutionized the process by combining these two design steps into one: they’ve developed an integrated microfluidic cooling technology together with the electronics, that can efficiently manage the large heat fluxes generated by transistors."</em> <a href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/transistor-integrated-cooling-for-a-more-powerful-/">[...]</a>

KAUST researchers have developed a fast and efficient way to make a carbon material that could be ideally suited to dissipating heat in electronic devices. This versatile material could also have additional uses ranging from gas sensors to solar cells. Many electronic devices use graphite films to draw away and dissipate the heat generated by their electronic components. Although graphite is a naturally occurring form of carbon, heat management of electronics is a demanding application and usually relies on use of high-quality micrometer-thick manufactured graphite films. “However, the method used to make these graphite films, using polymer as a source material, is complex and very energy intensive,” says G. Deokar, a postdoc in Pedro Costa's lab, who led the work."</em> <a href="https://discovery.kaust.edu.sa/en/article/1032/next-gen-smartphones-to-keep-their-cool">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Hey there, in this project I have used Bolt device, Two-way switches and 4 channel-relay module. simple and easy to implement in real life. Hey there, This project is a mixture of projects I saw on you-tube. I have made this project so that our home appliances such as lights, fans, doors, windows etc can be automatically operated with our mobiles with just single touch from all over the world, but yah as this project is based on Inter of Things you will always need a active Wi-Fi connection. One can also operate it with voice commands and if at all your Wi-Fi has some problem I have used two way switches which can operates as a normal switch at that time. In our day-to-day life its very tough to remember things like giving water to plans or closing the window or some times you forget that did I close the lights and fan?"</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/muderpeer786/home-automation-using-bolt-module-185b46">[...]</a>

<p><em>"OpenCV OAK-D camera with ADLINK Edge AI hardware &amp; software to build a social distancing solution. As we deal with these unprecedented times organisations are looking at how people can return to physical shared spaces. A common approach to this solution is to use computer vision to monitor the occupancy of shared spaces in schools, offices and retail stores. But with the technology that is currently available we can take this one step further and monitor the distance between people in these shared spaces. With information about the number of people and the distances between people we can build innovative alerting solutions to notify when good social distancing practices are not being adhered to. The most basic alerting solution is to provide a dashboard with a people counter and distances graph."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/toby-mcclean/adlink-social-distancing-solution-9fb05f">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scan the leaves of a plant with an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense and train a model to detect if it's diseased. Just like humans, plants can become diseased too. And just like how you might develop a rash from a skin infection, a plant's leaves might become yellowed and/or blotchy from a fungus or other pathogen. So, by leveraging the power of machine learning, colors can be scanned and then used to train a model that can detect when a leaf's color is off. The brain of this project is the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense, and it was chosen for several reasons. First, it has a rich set of powerful sensors, including a 9DoF IMU, APDS-9960 (color, gesture, proximity, and brightness), microphone, and a temperature/humidity/pressure sensor combo."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/gatoninja236/determining-a-plant-s-health-with-tinyml-085003">[...]</a>

For a breadboard setup like my development device, you will need two push buttons, two 7-digit LEDs and one SDCard socket (with built-in or separate level shifters) and some wires and resistors.

It does precisely what ordinary dice do: The player makes a shuffling motion with his/her hand, the dice shuffles, when the hand is removed, it takes a few seconds to show the output; just as it does when a regular die is released and rolls for a bit before coming to a standstill. Small details like these moments of suspense are also included in this device. It is powered using a normal power bank via a USB cable. Playing board games with your family is a good way to spend time while cooped up at home, and this device ensures there is no spread of viruses by objects in common contact, where generally overlooked things like conventional game dice can be fomites for COVID-19."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/CookerBird/touchless-game-dice-aa640c">[...]</a>
