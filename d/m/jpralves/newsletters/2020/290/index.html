<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1918, o astrónomo holandês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrik_C._van_de_Hulst">Hendrik C. van de Hulst</a>. Ele previu teoricamente que no espaço interestelar a quantidade de hidrogénio atómico neutro, que em sua transição hiperfina irradia e absorve a um comprimento de onda de 21 cm, pode-se esperar que ocorra em densidades de coluna tão altas a ponto de fornecer uma linha espectral suficientemente forte a ponto de ser mensurável. A linha de 21 cm de hidrogénio atómico foi detectada em 1951, a primeira na Universidade de Harvard seguida em poucas semanas por outros. A descoberta demonstrou que a pesquisa astronómica, que naquela época era limitada à luz convencional, poderia ser complementada com observações em comprimentos de onda de rádio, revelando uma série de novos processos físicos.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1922, o geofísico britânico <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Runcorn">Keith Runcorn</a>. Ele foi o primeiro a descobrir evidências das inversões polares periódicas do campo magnético da Terra. Na década de 1950 ele foi um pioneiro na disciplina incipiente do paleomagnetismo, ou magnetismo remanente, o estudo do magnetismo residual. Ele também fez contribuições substanciais para vários campos, incluindo convecção na Terra e Lua, a forma e campos magnéticos da Lua e planetas, magnetohidrodinâmica do núcleo da Terra, correntes terrestres, mudanças na duração do dia e divagação polar, deriva continental e tectónica de placas.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1936, o químico taiwanês-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_T._Lee">Yuan T. Lee</a>. Ele repartiu (com Dudley R. Herschbach e John C. Polanyi) o Prémio Nobel de Química em 1986 pelo seu papel no desenvolvimento da dinâmica da reacção química. Como investigador de pós-doutorado, Lee experimentou e desenvolveu a invenção de Herschbach da “técnica de feixe molecular cruzado”. Este estudo analisou reacções entre moléculas em baixas pressões, permitindo que feixes de moléculas e / ou átomos se encontrassem num ponto no espaço. Lee estendeu a técnica de Herschbach, introduzindo a espectroscopia de massa para identificar os produtos resultantes das reacções dos átomos de oxigénio e flúor com compostos orgânicos complexos.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou a cápsula Dragon da SpaceX chegou à Estação Espacial Internacional. Depois de ter sido lançada no passado dia 15 no foguetão SpaceX Falcon 9 os quatro astronautas, três norte-americanos e um japonês chegaram em segurança. Esta missão é a primeira de seis certificadas, as missões da tripulação NASA e SpaceX vão voar como parte do Programa de Tripulação Comercial da agência.</p>

<p>Também esta semana foi noticia uma "bola de fogo" que atravessou os céus do sul de Portugal e Espanha na madrugada da passada segunda-feira. O objecto calcula-se que se deslocava a uma velocidade de 227 mil quilómetros e destruiu-se a cerca de 61 quilómetros de altura sobre o distrito de Évora.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos assim como projetos de maker. É apresentada a revista HackSpace Magazine nº37 de Dezembro.</p>

The first three stages functioned nominally until the ignition of the AVUM upper stage, eight minutes after departure from the launch pad. At that time, a degraded trajectory was detected, followed by a loss of control of the vehicle and the subsequent loss of the mission. The launcher fell in a completely uninhabited area close to the drop zone planned for the Zefiro 9 stage.

The new technique could achieve a variety of conventional and unconventional optical functions in a flat glass component (with no surface curvature), offering new optical design versatility in environmentally stable glass materials. The team was able to tailor the gradient in the material compositions by actively controlling the ratio of two different glass-forming pastes or “inks” blended together inline using the direct ink writing (DIW) method of 3D printing. After the composition-varying optical preform is built using DIW, it is then densified to glass and can be finished using conventional optical polishing. “The change in material composition leads to a change in refractive index once we convert it to glass,” said LLNL scientist Rebecca Dylla-Spears, lead author of a paper appearing today in Science Advances. The project started in 2016 when the team began looking at ways that additive manufacturing could be used to advance optics and optical systems."</em> <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/news/3d-printed-glass-enhances-optical-design-flexibility">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The quantum dynamics of hydrogen is central to many problems in nature, being strongly influenced by the environment in which it takes place. In their contribution to PRL, members of the Lise Meitner Group at the MPSD address hydrogen transfer within a supported molecular switch, showing that the surface support can play a decisive role in the tunneling reaction. In the constant quest to miniaturize technological components, molecule-based nanotechnology becomes an ever-growing field of interest. In this field, single molecules become the fundamental components of electronic devices. The sheer variety of possible molecular architectures and the possibility of precisely manipulating molecular synthesis opens the door to endless functional components. However, the key challenge is to gain control over these functions in the nanoscale, where quantum mechanical effects become prominent."</em> <a href="https://www.mpsd.mpg.de/482984/2020-11-litman-switches?c=2736">[...]</a>

But a new fabrication process, developed by scientists at EPFL, brings lifelike synthetic polymers a step closer. Natural materials like skin, cartilage and tendons are tough enough to support our bodyweight and movements, yet flexible enough that they don’t crack easily. Although we take these properties for granted, replicating this unique combination in synthetic materials is much harder than it sounds. Now, scientists at EPFL have developed a new way of making strong, supple composite polymers that more closely mimic materials found in the natural world.

Following a review of engineering assessments, the U.S. National Science Foundation today announced it will begin planning the controlled decommissioning of the 1,000-foot-wide telescope at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. The observatory, which UCF manages for NSF under a cooperative agreement, has for 57 years served as a world-class resource for radio astronomy and planetary, solar system and geospace research. But a main cable break on Nov. 6 caused the structural integrity of the telescope to come into question.

<p><em>"In tokamaks, magnetic confinement devices being explored for use as nuclear fusion reactors, anomalous events can cause a transfer of energy with 10 million times the intensity of the solar radiation on Earth’s surface. These events can cause damage to structural components, potentially threatening the longevity of a tokamak. Penn State researchers recently published a paper on simulating these conditions in the laboratory, without use of a tokamak, to investigate the effects of such an extreme heat load on tungsten. They published their findings in npj Materials Degradation on Oct. 2. “To make fusion power really work instead of just working theoretically, we need to understand how some materials will survive better than others,” said Leigh Winfrey, associate professor in the Ken and Mary Alice Lindquist Department of Nuclear Engineering. “This research gives us a better understanding of the problem.” When a tokamak operates, high-energy plasma flows through its chamber in a donut-like shape, bounded by magnetic fields so the plasma — often at temperatures of several hundred million degrees Fahrenheit — does not touch the tokamak walls."</em> <a href="https://news.psu.edu/story/639600/2020/11/18/research/tungsten-develops-layers-under-fusion-reactor-extreme-heat">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Silicon-polymer hybrid modulators capable of optical data rates of 200 Gbit/s at temperatures up to 110 °C could help reduce datacenter cooling costs Datacenters could benefit from lower cooling costs in part to ultra-fast electro-optic modulators developed by researchers in Japan using a polymer that is stable even at temperatures that would boil water. Reported in the journal Nature Communications, the silicon-polymer hybrid modulators can transmit 200 gigabits of data per second at up to 110 °C and could enable optical data interconnections that are both extremely fast and reliable at high temperatures, reducing the need for cooling and expanding applications in harsh environments like rooftops and cars. Demand for high-speed data transmission such as for high-definition media streaming has exploded in recent years, and optical communications are central to many of the necessary data connections. A critical component is the modulator, which puts data on a beam of light passing through an electro-optic material that can change its optical properties in response to an electric field. Most modulators currently use inorganic semiconductors or crystals as the electro-optic material, but organic-based polymers have the advantages that they can be fabricated with excellent electro-optic properties at a low cost and operated at low voltages. “Polymers have great potential for use in modulators, but reliability issues still need to be overcome for many industry applications,” explains Shiyoshi Yokoyama, professor of Kyushu University’s Institute for Materials Chemistry and Engineering and leader of the research collaboration."</em> <a href="https://www.kyushu-u.ac.jp/en/researches/view/180">[...]</a>

Two years back I was getting into 3D printing in a big way and started thinking… What if I 3D printed a guitar? Well, that led me on a journey of making my own 3D printer big enough to print a guitar body. Keep reading to see how I built a 3D printed guitar, that also lights up when you play it!

These would be the same 3 bubble indicators you would have on any decent level you purchase at the hardware store. We’ve built in some nice features and housed it all in a nice 3D printed enclosure that looks like any standard level, printed in what I call DeWalt Yellow (But it’s really Hatchbox brand Yellow PLA!) - Automatic rotating screen so that the view of the angle is always readable to you even if you flip it completely upside down.

It began first with the concept of utilizing addressable ws2812b LED strips to indicate the time in an alternate base. I've worked on binary clocks a few times in the past but have grown a little tired of the concept, and I wanted to create something that would make more efficient use of fewer LEDs so that I could power them directly from an esp8266 without worrying about drawing too much power from the board itself and burning it out.
