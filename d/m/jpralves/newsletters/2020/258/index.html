<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1770, o físico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Johann_Seebeck">Thomas Johann Seebeck</a>. Ele descobriu (1821) que uma corrente eléctrica flui entre diferentes materiais condutores que são mantidos em diferentes temperaturas, conhecido como efeito Seebeck. É a base do termopar e é considerada a medição mais precisa da temperatura. É também um componente-chave do semicondutor, a base do moderno computador. O trabalho de Seebeck foi a base das descobertas do físico alemão Georg Simon Ohm (1789-1854) em electricidade e do físico francês Jean Charles Athanase Peltier (1785-1845), cujo efeito Peltier ficou conhecido como uma maneira de usar a electricidade para congelar a água (ar condicionado, refrigeração).</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1791, o matemático inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Peacock">George Peacock</a>. Ele, juntamente com os colegas de graduação Charles Babbage e John Herschel, trouxe reformas à nomenclatura na matemática inglesa. Eles formaram a Analytical Society (1815), cujo objectivo era levar os métodos avançados de cálculo da Europa para Cambridge para substituir a notação cada vez mais estagnada de Isaac Newton do século anterior. A Sociedade produziu uma tradução de um livro de Lacroix no cálculo diferencial e integral. Em 1830, ele publicou o Tratado sobre Álgebra, que tentou dar à álgebra um tratamento lógico, e que foi pelo menos parcialmente para o estabelecimento da álgebra simbólica. Em vez de usar apenas números, ele usou objectos e mostrou a associatividade e a comutatividade desses objectos.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1864, o engenheiro electrotécnico inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Ziani_de_Ferranti">Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti</a>. Ele promoveu a instalação de grandes estações geradoras eléctricas e redes de distribuição de corrente alternada na Inglaterra. Com cerca de 20 anos, ele começou a planear uma estação geradora ambiciosa a cerca de 13 quilómetros dos arredores de Londres, para usar a transmissão a 10.000 volts - quatro vezes maior do que era prático anteriormente. Para isso, ele começou a projectar cabos, transformadores e geradores adequados. A sua ideia de fabricar cabos flexíveis de alta tensão usando papel impregnado com cera para isolamento foi um marco histórico usado exclusivamente até ao advento de materiais sintéticos. As suas 176 patentes cobrem diversas invenções.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1865, o engenheiro electrotécnico e inventor de origem alemã <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Proteus_Steinmetz">Charles Proteus Steinmetz</a>. As suas teorias e análises matemáticas dos sistemas de corrente alternada ajudaram a estabelecê-los como a forma preferida de energia eléctrica nos Estados Unidos e em todo o mundo. Em 1893, Steinmetz entrou para a recém-criada General Electric Company, onde era engenheiro e depois consultor até sua morte. As suas primeiras pesquisas sobre histerese (perda de potência devido à resistência magnética) levaram-o a estudar a corrente alternada, o que poderia eliminar a perda de histerese nos motores. Ele fez um extenso trabalho sobre a teoria de AC para engenheiros electrotécnicos usarem. A sua última pesquisa foi sobre relâmpagos e a sua ameaça para as novas linhas de energia AC. Ele foi responsável pela expansão da indústria de energia eléctrica nos EUA.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1869, o matemático francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89lie_Cartan">Élie Cartan</a>. Ele desenvolveu muito a teoria dos grupos de Lie e contribuiu para a teoria das subalgebras. Em 1904, Cartan voltou-se para artigos sobre equações diferenciais e, a partir de 1916, publicou principalmente sobre geometria diferencial. Cartan também publicou trabalhos sobre a relatividade e a teoria dos spinors. Ele é certamente um dos matemáticos mais importantes da primeira metade do século XX.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1899, o Fabricante americano de aeronaves <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Smith_McDonnell">James Smith McDonnell</a>. Ele iniciou a sua primeira empresa em 1928, para construir o Doodlebug único, mas como não encontrou mercado, passou os próximos 10 anos a trabalhar em várias empresas de aeronaves. Posteriormente, ele fundou a McDonnell Aircraft Co.on, em St. Louis, em 6 de Julho de 1939. Entre suas realizações notáveis, figuram a produção do primeiro caça a jacto da Marinha dos EUA (1946), o FM-1; Mercury, a primeira nave espacial tripulada da América a orbitar a Terra (1962) e o jacto F-4 Phantom.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1919, o engenheiro e inventor americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Presper_Eckert">J. Presper Eckert</a>. Ele foi o inventor do primeiro computador electrónico de uso geral, uma máquina digital que foi o protótipo para a maioria dos computadores actualmente em uso. Em 1946, Eckert com John W. Mauchly cumpriu um contrato do governo para construir um computador digital para ser usado pelo Exército dos EUA para cálculos militares. Eles chamaram-o de ENIAC para Integrador Numérico Electrónico e Computador. Em 1949, eles fundaram uma empresa de fabricação de computadores BINAC. Isso foi seguido por um computador voltado para os negócios, o UNIVAC (1951), que foi utilizado para muitos usos e estimulou o crescimento da indústria de computadores. Em 1966, Eckert possuía 85 patentes, principalmente para invenções electrónicas.</p>

<p><em>"The electricity that lights our homes and powers our appliances also creates small magnetic fields that are present all around us. Scientists have developed a new mechanism capable of harvesting this wasted magnetic field energy and converting it into enough electricity to power next-generation sensor networks for smart buildings and factories. “Just like sunlight is a free source of energy we try to harvest, so are magnetic fields,” said Shashank Priya, professor of materials science and engineering and associate vice president for research at Penn State. “We have this ubiquitous energy present in our homes, office spaces, work spaces and cars. It’s everywhere, and we have an opportunity to harvest this background noise and convert it to useable electricity.” A team led by Penn State scientists developed a device that provides 400 percent higher power output compared to other state-of-the-art technology when working with low-level magnetic fields, like those found in our homes and buildings. The technology has implications for the design of smart buildings, which will require self-powered wireless sensor networks to do things like monitor energy and operational patterns and remotely control systems, the scientists said."</em> <a href="https://news.psu.edu/story/613154/2020/03/31/research/scientists-tap-unused-energy-source-power-smart-sensor-networks">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Entanglement, a powerful form of correlation among quantum systems, is an important resource for quantum computing. Researchers from the Quantum Optomechanics group at the Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, recently entangled two laser beams through bouncing them off the same mechanical resonator, a tensioned membrane. This provides a novel way of entangling disparate electromagnetic fields, from microwave radiation to optical beams. In particular, creating entanglement between optical and microwave fields would be a key step towards solving the long-standing challenge of sharing entanglement between two distant quantum computers operating in the microwave regime. The result is now published in Nature Communications. In a future quantum internet, that is the internet of quantum computers, entanglement needs to be shared between two distant quantum computers."</em> <a href="https://www.nbi.ku.dk/english/news/news20/quantum-entangled-light-from-a-vibrating-membrane/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.uclan.ac.uk/news/new-images-reveal-fine-threads-of-million-degree-plasma.php">New Images Reveal Fine Threads Of Million-degree Plasma Woven Throughout The Sun’s Atmosphere</a></h2>

<p><em>"Researchers at the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan) unveil highest-ever resolution images of the Sun from NASA’s solar sounding rocket mission Newly released images of the Sun have revealed that its outer layer is filled with previously unseen, incredibly fine magnetic threads filled with extremely hot, million-degree plasma. The high-resolution observations have been analysed by researchers at UCLan alongside collaborators from NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Centre (MSFC) and will provide astronomers with a better understanding of how the Sun’s magnetised atmosphere exists, and what it is comprised of. Until now, certain parts of the Sun’s atmosphere had appeared dark or mostly empty, but new images have revealed strands that are around 500km in width - roughly the distance between London and Belfast - with hot electrified gases flowing inside them. The ultra-sharp images were taken by NASA’s High-Resolution Coronal Imager (or Hi-C for short), a unique astronomical telescope carried into space on a sub-orbital rocket flight. The telescope can pick out structures in the Sun’s atmosphere as small as 70km in size, or around 0.01% the size of the Sun, making these the highest resolution images ever taken of the Sun’s atmosphere. The exact physical mechanism that is creating these pervasive hot strands remains unclear, so scientific debate will now focus on why they are formed, and how their presence helps us understand the eruption of solar flares and solar storms that could affect life on Earth."</em> <a href="https://www.uclan.ac.uk/news/new-images-reveal-fine-threads-of-million-degree-plasma.php">[...]</a>

For decades researchers have envisioned a world where digital user interfaces are seamlessly integrated with the physical environment, until the two are virtually indistinguishable from one another. This vision, though, is held up by a few boundaries. First, it’s difficult to integrate sensors and display elements into our tangible world due to various design constraints. Second, most methods to do so are limited to smaller scales, bound by the size of the fabricating device. Recently, a group of researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) came up with SprayableTech, a system that lets users create room-sized interactive surfaces with sensors and displays."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2020/mit-csail-sprayabletech-sprayable-user-interfaces-0408">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Glioblastoma is the deadliest form of brain tumor—less than 10 percent of people who are diagnosed with it will survive more than five years. A group of researchers has devised a new way to study this rapidly spreading cancer, using a three-dimensional structure made of an agglomeration of human brain cells and biomaterials. Their work, published in Science Advances, could help medical professionals better understand how the tumor grows and to speed up the potential discovery of new drugs to fight it. “This is a very difficult brain tumor to treat,” says Guohao Dai, an associate professor of bioengineering at Northeastern and corresponding author on the study. “And it’s also difficult to do research on the brain tumor, because you cannot really see what’s happening.” Inside a living brain, researchers can’t directly observe how tumor cells grow and respond to treatment. Studies are typically done in mice or rats, and the animals must be dissected to understand the tumor’s development."</em> <a href="https://news.northeastern.edu/2020/04/01/a-3d-printed-brain-could-make-it-easier-to-find-cancer-treatments/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Machine-learning based algorithm characterizes 3D material microstructure in real time Modern scientific research on materials relies heavily on exploring their behavior at the atomic and molecular scales. For that reason, scientists are constantly on the hunt for new and improved methods for data gathering and analysis of materials at those scales. Researchers at the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM), a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science User Facility located at the DOE’s Argonne National Laboratory, have invented a machine-learning based algorithm for quantitatively characterizing, in three dimensions, materials with features as small as nanometers. Researchers can apply this pivotal discovery to the analysis of most structural materials of interest to industry. “What makes our algorithm unique is that if you start with a material for which you know essentially nothing about the microstructure, it will, within seconds, tell the user the exact microstructure in all three dimensions,” said Subramanian Sankaranarayanan, group leader of the CNM theory and modeling group and an associate professor in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering at the University of Illinois at Chicago. “For example, with data analyzed by our 3D tool,” said Henry Chan, CNM postdoctoral researcher and lead author of the study, ​“users can detect faults and cracks and potentially predict the lifetimes under different stresses and strains for all kinds of structural materials.” “What makes our algorithm unique is that if you start with a material for which you know essentially nothing about the microstructure, it will, within seconds, tell the user the exact microstructure in all three dimensions.” — Subramanian Sankaranarayanan, CNM group leader and associate professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago Most structural materials are polycrystalline, meaning a sample used for purposes of analysis can contain millions of grains."</em> <a href="https://www.anl.gov/article/capturing-3d-microstructures-in-real-time">[...]</a>

The key agent that helps to make these dispersions last for days is the oxidized form of graphene named graphene oxide. The authors have applied for patent for the method to prepare dispersions. Graphene, graphite, activated carbons are quite different forms of carbon but what is common for them is their hydrophobic properties. It is impossible to dissolve or disperse these materials in water directly. On the other hand, using dispersions or solutions for many applications is a big advantage."</em> <a href="https://www.umu.se/en/news/physicists-produce-stable-water-based-graphene-dispersions_9066278/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/flexoskeletons">Thanks to “flexoskeletons,” these insect-inspired robots are faster and cheaper to make</a></h2>

<p><em>"Engineers at the University of California San Diego have developed a new method that doesn’t require any special equipment and works in just minutes to create soft, flexible, 3D-printed robots. The innovation comes from rethinking the way soft robots are built: instead of figuring out how to add soft materials to a rigid robot body, the UC San Diego researchers started with a soft body and added rigid features to key components. The structures were inspired by insect exoskeletons, which have both soft and rigid parts—the researchers called their creations “flexoskeletons.” The new method allows for the construction of soft components for robots in a small fraction of the time previously needed and for a small fraction of the cost. “We hope that these flexoskeletons will lead to the creation of a new class of soft, bioinspired robots,” said Nick Gravish, a mechanical engineering professor at the Jacobs School of Engineering at UC San Diego and the paper’s senior author. “We want to make soft robots easier to build for researchers all over the world.” The new method makes it possible to build large groups of flexoskeleton robots with little manual assembly as well as assemble a library of Lego-like components so that robot parts can be easily swapped. The flexoskeletons are made from 3D printing a rigid material on a thin sheet that acts as a flexible base."</em> <a href="https://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/flexoskeletons">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Research may unlock the ability for devices to process ultra-high-speed wireless data and simultaneously harvest energy for power. Researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill made a one-way street for electrons that may unlock the ability for devices to process ultra-high-speed wireless data and simultaneously harvest energy for power. The researchers did this by shaping silicon on a microscopic scale to create a funnel, or “ratchet,” for electrons. This method overcomes the speed limitations of prior technologies by removing interfaces that tend to slow down devices.“This work is exciting because it could enable a future where things like low-power smartwatches are wirelessly charged from the data they already receive without ever needing to a leave a person’s wrist,” said James Custer Jr., a doctoral student in UNC-Chapel Hill’s College of Arts &amp; Sciences.

In a study published in the journal Advanced Materials Interfaces, the researchers demonstrated that this technique allows the surface of copper to immediately kill off superbugs such as MRSA. “Copper has been used as an antimicrobial material for centuries. But it typically takes hours for native copper surfaces to kill off bacteria,” said Rahim Rahimi, a Purdue assistant professor of materials engineering."</em> <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2020/Q2/now-metal-surfaces-can-be-instant-bacteria-killers,-thanks-to-new-laser-treatment-technique.html">[...]</a>

Table-​top laser systems have emerged that enable studies that for decades were but a distant dream — to follow, image and characterise electronic processes in atoms, molecules and solids on their natural, attosecond timescales. The laser systems that make such studies possible typically operate in the extreme ultraviolet spectral band.

Brief description: It is a very sensitive barometer that emits sounds when climb (going up) and also when sinking (going down). Sounds are simple beep-beep, every second, or two per second or more during climb (more climb rate = higher frequency beeps): it is so sensible that it starts beeping just after a few centimeters (!) per second; you may try slowly lifting your arm holding in the hand the Vario to obtain the sound."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/zoncatan/acoustic-variometer-ultra-sensible-barometer-259043">[...]</a>
