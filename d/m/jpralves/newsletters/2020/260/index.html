<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1856 o inventor norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granville_Woods">Granville Woods</a>. Ele detinha inúmeras patentes em diversos campos. Como o inventor negro mais prolífico da carreira do final do século XIX e início do século XX nos EUA, ele foi chamado de Black Edison. A primeira patente de Wood (3 de Junho de 1884) foi para uma caldeira de locomotiva a vapor. Ele fundou a Woods Electric Company, em Cincinnati, Ohio, para desenvolver comercialmente uma variedade de dispositivos eléctricos. Em 1887, ele patenteou seu Synchronous Multiplex Railway Telegraph, que permitia a movimentação de comboios para manter ligações de comunicação, evitando acidentes. As suas outras patentes incluíam um transmissor de telefone, uma ferrovia eléctrica, uma incubadora eléctrica para  incubação de frangos  (1900) e um importante dispositivo de segurança - um freio a ar automático para uso ferroviário.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1858 o físico teórico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Planck">Max Planck</a>. Ele estudou em Munique e Berlim, com Helmholtz, Clausius e Kirchhoff e posteriormente ingressou na faculdade. Ele tornou-se professor de física teórica (1889-1926). O seu trabalho sobre a lei da termodinâmica e a distribuição da radiação de um corpo negro levou-o a abandonar os princípios newtonianos clássicos e a introduzir a teoria quântica (1900), pela qual recebeu o Prémio Nobel de Física em 1918. Isto pressupõe que a energia é não é infinitamente subdivisível, mas, no final de contas, existe em quantidades discretas que ele chamou de quanta (latim, "quanto"). Além disso, a energia transportada por um quantum depende em proporção directa à frequência de sua fonte de radiação.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1941 o programador norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Tomlinson">Ray Tomlinson</a>. Ele ficou conhecido por ter implementado o primeiro programa de correio electrónico na ARPANET, a rede precursora da Internet.
Para conseguir isso, ele usou o sinal @ para separar o nome do utilizador do nome da sua máquina, um formato que tem sido usado em endereços de e-mail desde então. Pode-se dizer que esta Newsletter chega a todos em parte graças ao sistema criado por este senhor.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou a SpaceX fez o seu sétimo lançamento de satélites Starlink. Foi na passada terça-feira que foram colocados mais 60 satélites no espaço. A missão decorreu com sucesso tendo o Falcon 9 sido lançado e recuperado com sucesso pela embarcação “Of Course I Still Love You”.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana foi lançada a nova versão do sistema Ubuntu, a versão 20.04 é uma versão LTS e apresenta inúmeras novidades relativamente ao suporte e às funcionalidades que compõe. A Canonical, no lançamento desta versão com o nome de código Focal Fossa, destaca a utilização da serie 5.4 do Kernel Linux, o suporte nativo do Wireguard para VPNs, um toolchain refrescado de ferramentas de desenvolvimento que inclui o glibc 2.31, OpenJDK 11, Python 3.8.2, php 7.4, perl 5.30, e o golang 1.13. Também a interface gráfica foi actualizada para o GNOME 3.36 e foram feitas diversas melhorias de performance nesta interface.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos artigos científicos assim como projetos de maker. São apresentadas a revista neweletronics de 14 de Abril e a Hackspace Magazine nº30 de Maio de 2020.</p>

<p><em>"The 25 Gigabit Ethernet Consortium, originally established to develop 25, 50 and 100 Gbps Ethernet specifications, announced today it has changed its name to the Ethernet Technology Consortium in order to reflect a new focus on higher-speed Ethernet technologies. The goal of the consortium is to enhance the Ethernet specification to operate at new speeds by utilizing specifications that are developed or in development. This allows the organization to work alongside other industry groups and standards bodies to adapt Ethernet at a pace that aligns with the rapidly evolving needs of the industry. The ETC has more than 45 members with top-level promoter members that include Arista, Broadcom, Cisco, Dell, Google, Mellanox and Microsoft. “Ethernet is evolving very quickly and as a group, we felt that having 25G in the name was too constraining for the scope of the consortium,” said Brad Booth, chair of the Ethernet Technology Consortium. “We wanted to open that up so that the industry could have an organization that could enhance Ethernet specifications for new and developing markets.” Championing 800GbE One of the first specifications to be championed by the newly named organization is the 800GBASE-R specification for 800 Gigabit Ethernet (GbE)."</em> <a href="https://ethernettechnologyconsortium.org/press-room/press-releases/25-gigabit-ethernet-consortium-rebrands-to-ethernet-technology-consortium-announces-800-gigabit-ethernet-gbe-specification-152/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/about/faculty-science/news/stretchable-sheets-atoms-tuned-quantum-technologies">Stretchable sheets of atoms tuned for quantum technologies</a></h2>

<p><em>"A team of scientists from the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) and the Australian National University (ANU) believe they have developed a way to address a decades-long challenge in the field of quantum materials – the spectral tuning of proposed quantum light sources. The researchers say their results, using an atomically thin material, hexagonal boron nitride, constitute a significant step forward in understanding light–matter interactions of quantum systems in 2D materials, and the journey towards scalable on-chip devices for quantum technologies. The study is published in the journal Advanced Materials. The ability to finely tune the colours of quantum light has been proposed as a key step in developing quantum network architectures, where photons, the fundamental building block of light, are exploited to serve as the quantum messenger to communicate between distant sites. The scientists harnessed the extreme stretchability of hexagonal boron nitride, also known as “white graphene” to such an extent that they were able to demonstrate a world record for the largest spectral, colour-tuning range from an atomically thin quantum system. Lead author, UTS PhD candidate Noah Mendelson said that the improvement in spectral tuning by almost an order of magnitude would spark interest within both academic and industrial groups “working towards the development of quantum networks and related quantum technologies.” “This material was grown in the lab at UTS with some atomic-scale ‘crystal-mistakes’ that are ultra-bright and extremely stable quantum sources."</em> <a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/about/faculty-science/news/stretchable-sheets-atoms-tuned-quantum-technologies">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Carbon nanotubes embedded in leaves detect chemical signals that are produced when a plant is damaged. MIT engineers have developed a way to closely track how plants respond to stresses such as injury, infection, and light damage, using sensors made of carbon nanotubes. These sensors can be embedded in plant leaves, where they report on hydrogen peroxide signaling waves. Plants use hydrogen peroxide to communicate within their leaves, sending out a distress signal that stimulates leaf cells to produce compounds that will help them repair damage or fend off predators such as insects. The new sensors can use these hydrogen peroxide signals to distinguish between different types of stress, as well as between different species of plants. “Plants have a very sophisticated form of internal communication, which we can now observe for the first time."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2020/cnt-nanosensor-smartphone-plant-stress-0415">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://en.ustc.edu.cn/2020/0415/c15527a418242/page.htm">High-efficiency Catalyst Enhancing the Electric Reduction Performance of CO2</a></h2>

<p><em>"Electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into fuels and value-added feedstocks, ideally if powered by renewable electricity, provides a route to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and simultaneously close the carbon loop. At present, the rational design and controllable synthesis of more efficient catalysts, combined with the understanding of the catalytic mechanism, in order to achieve the industrial application of CO2 electric reduction technology has become the research focus and difficulty. Recently, a team led by Prof. YU Shuhong and Prof. GAO Minrui from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) of CAS developed a microwave heating strategy for synthesizing a transition metal chalcogenide nanostructure that efficiently catalyzes CO2 electroreduction to carbon monoxide (CO). The series of research results were published in Angewandte Chemie and Journal of the American Chemical Society. A considerable challenge in the conversion of CO2 into useful fuels comes from the activation of CO2 to CO2•- or other intermediates, which often requires precious metallic catalysts, high overpotentials, and/or the electrolyte additives (e.g., ionic liquids). In the research, the researchers reported a microwave heating strategy for synthesizing a transition metal chalcogenide nanostructure that efficiently catalyzes CO2 electroreduction to CO."</em> <a href="https://en.ustc.edu.cn/2020/0415/c15527a418242/page.htm">[...]</a>

<p><em>"EPFL scientists, working in association with Canon, have developed a camera that can take 3D images with record-breaking speed and resolution “It’s something I’d been dreaming of for a long time,” says Edoardo Charbon, an EPFL professor and head of the Advanced Quantum Architecture Laboratory in EPFL’s School of Engineering. “MegaX is the culmination of over 15 years of research on single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs), which are photodetectors used in next-generation image-sensor technology.” And Charbon has good reason to be proud, since he and his research team have developed the world’s first million-pixel camera. Their findings have just been published in Optica. A shooting star What makes their camera different is that it can capture and count the very smallest form of light particle: the photon. Photons are invisible to the human eye; we can see only continuous beams of photons, like those used in laser pointers. But MegaX can film the trajectories of individual photons in rays of light."</em> <a href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/megax-the-first-camera-to-capture-the-smallest-par/">[...]</a>

Most electronic devices today, including smart phones and laptops, use flat, two-dimensional electronics for components, such as internal sensors or antennas. Three-dimensional electronics can offer curves and shapes that help save space inside devices. And complex shapes, which can only be practically made through 3D printing, can also improve product performance, for example, by making an antenna’s signal stronger."</em> <a href="https://samueli.ucla.edu/faster-way-to-build-complex-better-performing-3d-electronics/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In a material made of two thin crystal layers that are slightly twisted with respect to each other, researchers at ETH have studied the behaviour of strongly interacting electrons. Doing so, they found a number of surprising properties. Many modern technologies are based on special materials, such as the semiconductors that are important for computers, inside of which electrons can move more or less freely. Exactly how free those electrons are is determined by their quantum properties and the crystal structure of the material. Most of the time they move independently of each other. Under certain conditions, however, strong interactions between the electrons can give rise to particular phenomena."</em> <a href="https://ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2020/04/a-material-with-a-particular-twist.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"When electronics need their own power sources, there are two basic options: batteries and harvesters. Batteries store energy internally, but are therefore heavy and have a limited supply. Harvesters, such as solar panels, collect energy from their environments. This gets around some of the downsides of batteries but introduces new ones, in that they can only operate in certain conditions and can’t turn that energy into useful power very quickly. New research from the School of Engineering and Applied Science is bridging the gap between these two fundamental technologies for the first time in the form of a “metal-air scavenger” that gets the best of both worlds. This metal-air scavenger works like a battery, in that it provides power by repeatedly breaking and forming a series of chemical bonds."</em> <a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/new-scavenger-technology-allows-robots-eat-metal-energy">[...]</a>

Penn State researchers, led by Qiming Zhang, distinguished professor of electrical engineering, recently developed a scalable method that relies on engineered materials to increase both properties. The researchers altered a dielectric capacitor, a device that stores and regulates energy and is commonly used in electronics and electric systems. Using dopants —small, engineered materials also called metamaterials — the researchers altered the dielectric capacitor to increase storage capacity while also increasing electric charge efficiency, meaning the capacitor can withstand greater voltage with very little energy loss at temperatures higher than 300 degrees Fahrenheit. While other researchers have been able to do this for dielectric capacitors, the methods have been too expensive to scale for use with real products.

I used PCB for this, which I made myself and as I announced, I also made it on a professional board. This is my first purchased PCB and I am very satisfied with it. In the previous post, I described the project stages from idea to prototype, and in this project, I will focus on finalizing the project.

Another great thing is that you don't need a ton of space to fly them.

Many Amiga 500+ computers are suffering an early death because of the built-in barrel battery that powers their internal real-time clocks. Such batteries have long exceeded their planned lives and in many cases have started to leak alkaline liquids over the mainboard, corroding copper traces and destroying components. This damage can sometimes be repaired trivially, but many times it requires a lot of time and effort. Sometimes it adds up to other damage occurred over time and so it would just be better to have a new board built with new components to move the few critical chips over. Amiga mainboards haven't been produced for the last 30 years, but they are relatively simple by today's standards, thus an amateur project to make new ones was started."</em> <a href="https://github.com/SukkoPera/Raemixx500">[...]</a>

The TL431 is a "programmable precision reference"[1] and is commonly used in switching power supplies, where it provides feedback indicating if the output voltage is too high or too low. By using a special circuit called a bandgap, the TL431 provides a stable voltage reference across a wide temperature range.
