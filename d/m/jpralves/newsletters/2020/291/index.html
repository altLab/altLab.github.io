<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1810, o inventor, engenheiro e industrial inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Armstrong,_1st_Baron_Armstrong">William George Armstrong</a>. Ele inventou uma máquina hidroelétrica que produzia electricidade de fricção (1843), um guindaste hidráulico, um acumulador hidráulico para alimentar máquinas, a arma de carregamento da culatra Armstrong, protótipo de toda a artilharia moderna e uma arma de carregamento por culatra com cilindro de arame enrolado. Ele fundou a Elswick Engineering Works que fundiu as suas actividades de armamento e construção naval com a Vickers 'Sons and Co. para formar a Vickers Armstrong, Ltd. A sua mansão, Cragside, foi a primeira casa britânica iluminada por hidroeletricidade.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1817, o químico e educador francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Adolphe_Wurtz">Charles Adolphe Wurtz</a>. Ele ficou conhecido pelas suas pesquisas sobre compostos orgânicos de nitrogénio, hidrocarbonetos e glicóis. Em 1848, ele estudou um grupo de compostos relacionados à amónia chamados aminas e mostrou que pertenciam a um tipo com núcleo de nitrogénio. Na amónia, um átomo de nitrogénio foi ligado a três hidrogénios, enquanto nas aminas, os radicais orgânicos substituíram um ou mais desses hidrogénios.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1837, o químico inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Newlands_(chemist)">John Newlands</a>. Ele foi o primeiro que estabeleceu uma ordem de elementos pelos pesos atómicos e observou uma periodicidade nas propriedades. Cada oitavo elemento tem propriedades semelhantes, por isso ele chamou a Lei das Oitavas. Demorou mais um quarto de século, e o trabalho de outros, como Dmitry Mendeleev, para que o significado de sua descoberta fosse reconhecido na tabela periódica de elementos.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1876, o Inventor norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willis_Carrier">Willis Carrier</a>. Ele deu inicio ao ar condicionado moderno. Em 1902 (um ano depois de se formar com um M.E.), ele projectou seu primeiro sistema para controlar a temperatura e a humidade numa gráfica do Brooklyn. Em 2 de Janeiro de 1906, ele patenteou um "Aparelho para tratar o ar", o primeiro equipamento de ar condicionado tipo spray do mundo, (U.S. No. 808.897). As suas “Rational Psychrometric Formulas,” (1911) permanecem essenciais para engenheiros de ar condicionado. Em 1915, ele fundou a Carrier Engineering Corporation, para lidar com as condições de temperatura e humidade no ambiente industrial. Eventualmente, a tecnologia alcançou edifícios públicos e residências. Ele desenvolveu a primeira máquina de refrigeração centrífuga de baixa pressão segura usando refrigerante não tóxico e não inflamável.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1894, o matemático norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener">Norbert Wiener</a>. Ele estabeleceu a ciência da cibernética, um termo que ele cunhou, que se preocupa com os factores comuns de controle e comunicação em organismos vivos, máquinas automáticas e organizações. Ele alcançou renome internacional ao formular algumas das contribuições mais importantes para a matemática no século XX. O seu trabalho em análise harmónica generalizada e teoremas tauberianos ganhou o Prémio Bôcher em 1933, quando ele recebeu o prémio da American Mathematical Society pelas suas memórias Teoremas Tauberianos publicado em Annals of Mathematics no ano anterior. A sua extraordinária gama de interesses incluía processos estocásticos e teoria quântica.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1898, o químico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Ziegler">Karl Ziegler</a>. Ele dividiu o Prémio Nobel de Química de 1963 com Giulio Natta “pelas suas descobertas no campo da química e tecnologia de altos polímeros”, melhorando a qualidade dos plásticos. As moléculas de polímero são longas cadeias de milhares de átomos, formadas pela conexão de unidades repetidas de uma pequena molécula (o monómero). Ziegler encontrou forças eléctricas peculiares numa ligação entre um átomo de alumínio e um átomo de carbono numa cadeia de hidrocarbonetos: moléculas reactivas são atraídas e ensanduichadas entre esses dois átomos, aumentando o comprimento da cadeia. Quando a cadeia é longa o suficiente, a separação do alumínio interrompe o crescimento da molécula. A combinação de compostos de alumínio com outros compostos metálicos dá catalisadores Ziegler.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1940, o matemático italiano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Bombieri">Enrico Bombieri</a>. Ele recebeu a Medalha Fields em 1974 pelas suas principais contribuições ao estudo dos números primos, ao estudo das funções uni-valentes e à conjectura local de Bieberbach, à teoria das funções de várias variáveis complexas e à teoria da equações diferenciais e superfícies mínimas. "Teorema do valor médio de Bombieri", que diz respeito à distribuição dos primos em progressões aritméticas que se obtém pela aplicação dos métodos do crivo grande.</p>

<p>Faz hoje 55 anos que a França se tornou a 3ª nação a lançar um foguetão próprio um satélite artificial. O <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ast%C3%A9rix_(satellite)">Astérix</a> foi lançado a bordo de um foguetão Diamant a partir de Hammaguir, na Argélia. Tendo-se tornado nessa altura a 6ª nação a ter satélites artificiais a orbitar a Terra, o satélite Astérix comunicou com a Terra durante 111 dias. Devido à altitude relativamente elevada de sua órbita, não se espera que reentre na atmosfera da Terra por vários séculos.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje 9 anos que partia em direcção a Marte o rover Curiosity lançado num Foguetão Altas V. O Curiosity era o maior e mais poderoso veículo espacial que alguém tinha enviado ao Planeta Vermelho. O laboratório cientifico de duas toneladas tem o tamanho de um pequeno SUV. O objectivo da missão era procurar ambientes habitáveis em Marte, ou evidências de que o planeta poderia ter sido habitável no passado. A sua viagem durou cerca de 9 meses e
em poucas semanas, o Curiosity cumpriu a sua missão. Ele encontrou evidências de água corrente em Marte. Mais tarde, também encontrou moléculas orgânicas em Marte.</p>

<p>E nesta semana que passou a China lançou uma grande nave espacial robótica do Centro de Lançamento Espacial Wenchang, na província de Hainan, no sul da China, com a tarefa de pousar na Lua e trazer amostras lunares, 44 anos depois da última vez desde que substâncias extraterrestres foram trazidas de volta à Terra. O foguetão Chang Zheng 5, o maior e mais poderoso veículo de lançamento na China, ergueu seu corpo de 20 andares e voou em direcção ao céu, arrastando uma chama prateada espectacular às 4h30 da sua plataforma de lançamento, deixando muitos espectadores dentro e ao redor do centro costeiro de Wenchang com admiração e entusiasmo enquanto o gigantesco foguetão subia em direcção ao céu. Com cerca de 57 metros de altura e cerca de 852 Mil quilos este foguetão de dois estágios tem a capacidade de transportar cerca de 9 mil quilos de carga para a órbita trans-lunar.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos assim como projetos de maker. É apresentada a revista MagPi nº100 de Dezembro e a revista newelectronics de 24 de Novembro.</p>

<p><em>"China launched a large robotic spacecraft early Tuesday morning at the Wenchang Space Launch Center in South China's Hainan province, tasking it with landing on the moon and bringing back lunar samples, 44 years after the last time such extraterrestrial substances were brought back to Earth. A Long March 5 heavy-lift carrier rocket, the biggest and mightiest launch vehicle in China, lifted its 20-story-tall body and soared skyward trailing a spectacular silver flame at 4:30 am from its launch pad, leaving many spectators inside and around the coastal Wenchang center in awe and excitement as the gigantic booster thundered skyward. The rocket was tasked with placing the 8.2-metric ton Chang'e 5, which has four components -- orbiter, lander, ascender and re-entry capsule -- in an Earth-moon transfer trajectory. China launches Long March 5 heavy-lift carrier rocket at the Wenchang Space Launch Center in South China's Hainan province on Nov 24 early morning. [XU JINGXING / CHINA DAILY] The heaviest and largest in the nation's lunar probe fleet, Chang'e 5 will fly in the trajectory within the next several days and make some correction operations before conducting a key braking maneuver to avoid accidentally flying past the moon. After its arrival in lunar orbit, the probe will fly around the celestial body for a certain period of time and will then separate into two parts, with the orbiter and re-entry capsule remaining in orbit while the lander-ascender combination descending to the lunar surface."</em> <a href="http://www.cnsa.gov.cn/english/n6465652/n6465653/c6810558/content.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The Mbed team are pleased to announce the release of Mbed OS 6.5 today. The main content is the introduction of our new command line tooling, Mbed CLI 2, which will co-exist alongside the existing Mbed CLI tools for now, but which we plan to replace entirely in the future. Back in August, my colleague Jaeden Amero introduced our plans for these tools in a blog As Jaeden explained then, because of the way the tools had evolved organically, the underlying architecture was such that developing new features was costly, difficult, and piled up technical debt. When we decided to develop the new command line tooling we wanted to ensure that the underlying architecture was extensible, to make it easy to add new functionality, more maintainable and gave Mbed developers a better experience than the existing tools. We also wanted to base the tools on existing open source solutions, and, after an evaluation, settled on CMake as best meeting our needs. As an aside, whilst we were busy developing the new tools, the superb team at the USC Rocket Propulsion Lab announced their CMake based alternative to Mbed CLI."</em> <a href="https://os.mbed.com/blog/entry/Mbed-OS-65-released-today/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.toshiba.co.jp/rdc/rd/detail_e/e2011_01.html">Toshiba Develops World’s First Aqueous Lithium-ion Battery with Nonflammable Electrolyte</a></h2>

<p><em>"Toshiba Corporation has developed a prototype aqueous rechargeable lithium-ion battery that points the way to realization of the world's first aqueous large-capacity stationary storage battery that can operate at -30°C. Countering climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions will require greater reliance on renewable energy sources that are characterized by intermittent availability, and maximized utilization will only be possible with management systems integrating storage batteries that are safe and reliable over the long-term. Toshiba has addressed this concern by developing a battery cell that uses water as the aqueous electrolyte. The battery demonstrates low risk over the long term, even in the event of exposure to fire, which expands the range of locations where it can be installed. It also delivers the high durability of over 2,000 charge and discharge cycles, a performance that can contribute to expanded use of renewable energy. Details of the technology will be presented online at the 61st Battery Symposium in Japan on November 19, 2020."</em> <a href="http://www.toshiba.co.jp/rdc/rd/detail_e/e2011_01.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://techxplore.com/news/2020-11-obstacle-robots-owls.html">An obstacle avoidance system for flying robots inspired by owls</a></h2>

<p><em>"When developing robotic systems and computational tools, computer scientists often draw inspiration from animals or other biological systems. Depending on a system's unique characteristics and purpose, in fact, nature typically offers specific examples of how it could achieve its goals rapidly and effectively. Researchers at Shanghai Jiaotong University have recently developed a new bio-inspired and computer vision-based obstacle avoidance system that could improve the navigation of flying robots operating in dynamic environments. This system, presented in a paper pre-published on arXiv, is inspired by how owls detect and avoid objects or other animals in their surroundings. "Although owls are unable to move their eyes in any direction (similarly to stereo cameras), they have a very flexible neck that can swivel up to 270 degrees, which enables them to rapidly observe even behind without relocating their torso," the researchers write in their paper. To replicate the way in which owls move their eyes in different directions and detect both static and moving objects around them, the researchers mounted a servo motor and a stereo camera on a quadrotor (i.e., an unmanned flying robot with four rotors)."</em> <a href="https://techxplore.com/news/2020-11-obstacle-robots-owls.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"It’s not a stretch to say that stretchable sensors could change the way soft robots function and feel. In fact, they will be able to feel quite a lot. Cornell researchers have created a fiber-optic sensor that combines low-cost LEDs and dyes, resulting in a stretchable “skin” that detects deformations such as pressure, bending and strain. This sensor could give soft robotic systems – and anyone using augmented reality technology – the ability to feel the same rich, tactile sensations that mammals depend on to navigate the natural world. The researchers, led by Rob Shepherd, associate professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering in the College of Engineering, are working to commercialize the technology for physical therapy and sports medicine. Their paper, “Stretchable Distributed Fiber-Optic Sensors,” published Nov. 13 in Science."</em> <a href="https://www.cornell.edu/video/stretchable-sensor-robots-virtual-reality-human-touch">[...]</a>

Researchers at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology have recently developed a robotic fingertip that can change its shape and switch across three different configurations, which could allow it to grasp a broader variety of objects. This fingertip's unique design, outlined in a paper presented at this year's IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE), is inspired by origami, the renowned Japanese art of paper folding. "Our study was inspired by two common observations in current research and industrial applications," Zicheng Kan and Yazhan Zhang, two of the researchers who carried out the study, told TechXplore via email.

<p><em>"The quantum sensing abilities of nanodiamonds can be used to improve the sensitivity of paper-based diagnostic tests, potentially allowing for earlier detection of diseases such as HIV, according to a study led by UCL researchers in the i-sense McKendry group. Paper-based lateral flow tests work the same way as a pregnancy test in that a strip of paper is soaked in a fluid sample and a change in colour – or fluorescent signal – indicates a positive result and the detection of virus proteins or DNA. They are widely used to detect viruses ranging from HIV to SARS-CoV-2 (lateral flow tests for Covid-19 are currently being piloted across England) and can provide a rapid diagnosis, as the results do not have to be processed in a lab. The new research, published in Nature, found that low-cost nanodiamonds could be used to signal the presence of an HIV disease marker with a sensitivity many thousands of times greater than the gold nanoparticles widely used in these tests. This greater sensitivity allows lower viral loads to be detected, meaning the test could pick up lower levels of disease or detect the disease at an earlier stage, which is crucial for reducing transmission risk of infected individuals and for effective treatment of diseases such as HIV. The research team are working on adapting the new technology to test for COVID-19 and other diseases over the coming months."</em> <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2020/nov/quantum-nanodiamonds-may-help-detect-disease-earlier">[...]</a>

The goal of using the MKR WiFi card is to connect Otto to the Arduino Cloud to send commands remotely over the internet. I used 6 servo motors and in the programming we created a left step and right step function, the parameters that you will pass in the function must be adjusted according to your assembly, because the weight of the biped and the position of the servo motor are influencing factors in the step.

<p><em>"This is an isolated analog input module that is useful for interfacing Analog signals of various types originated from analog sensors and field devices. The module is very useful for in-process controls, factory automation, industrial applications, etc. Interfacing an analog voltage, an analog sensor to Arduino or other various microcontrollers with optical isolation is very easy with this module. The circuit requires two power supplies for the input and output sides. The module takes 0 to 5V analog input and provides optically isolated 0-3.3V as output. The circuit can also be interfaced with a 10V sensor, for 0 to 10V input, change the resistor R3 to 1.8K and the output will be the same 0 to 3.3V."</em> <a href="https://www.electronics-lab.com/project/optically-isolated-analog-input-module-for-arduino/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This is a E-ink dashboard that provides real-time information pulled from API using a Raspberry Pi Zero. I've always been interested in projects that provide you real-time information from selected sources, seeing people doing smart mirror projects made me want to do one for myself, one of the biggest reasons that I ended up doing this project was to help my partner in life in her mornings, she uses transit to go to work and this dashboard would provide her information of coming buses to our closest stops and what the current weather would be at the moment. I opted to use an e-paper display instead of an LCD due low power consumption, I've seen a lot of projects that provide you things like the weather, calendars or a task list that use a normal raspberry pi, I wanted something that could be hanged in the wall and possibly hidden within the frame, the raspberry pi zero w was a pretty good option. I had some knowledge of python from my work but still wanted to improve and learn more, this project helped me improve greatly on it, reading the instructions from the e-paper hat and seeing how other projects worked they provided me a great example. The way it works its pretty simple, you register on the site where you want to pull the information for an API key, then using the requests library to provide you a JSON list, once you have the information you are looking for you only need to format it to your liking, render it into a PNG with the PIL library and send it to the e-paper display. The first version I created, got the modules for transit (4 stops with 2 times each), the weather (current and 2 days forecast) and regular monthly calendar."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/duxenmx/e-ink-dashboard-886910">[...]</a>

We have used KSD215AC3 optically isolated solid-state relay to drive AC loads. We have tested this board with 200W/230V AC lamp, however, the load capacity of SSR is 15A. A snubber circuit is provided across the SSR-Triac which helps driving inductive loads. The heatsink on SSR is not required for loads up to 200W, however, for higher loads, it is advisable to mount SSR on a heatsink."</em> <a href="https://www.electronics-lab.com/project/infrared-remote-controlled-ac-load-on-off-switch-with-ssr/">[...]</a>
