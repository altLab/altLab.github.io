<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1895, o astrónomo alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolph_Minkowski">Rudolph Minkowski</a>. Ele estudou espectros, distribuições e movimentos de nebulosas planetárias e mais que duplicou o número conhecido. Ele investigou novas e super-novas e seus remanescentes, especialmente a física e a expansão da Nebulosa de Câncer (um remanescente pulsar). Com Walter Baade, Minkowski dividiu as super-novas nos tipos I e II com base nas características espectrais e identificaram contra-partes ópticas de muitas das primeiras fontes de rádio, incluindo Cygnus A, Virgo A (M87), Perseus A (NGC 1275) e Centaurus A (NGC 5128). Pouco antes de se reformar, ele encontrou o que foi durante anos o maior desvio para o vermelho conhecido numa galáxia. Ele foi premiado com a Medalha Bruce em 1961 por serviços distintos à astronomia.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1911, o físico americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_O._C._Nier">Alfred O. C. Nier</a>. Ele refinou o processo espectrométrico de massa para distinguir isótopos. Em 1934, com Lyman T. Aldrich, ele aplicou o decaimento do potássio-40 ao árgon-40 para medir a idade dos materiais geológicos. Ele descobriu (1936-38) uma série de novos isótopos de tão baixa abundância que não tinham sido detectados anteriormente, incluindo S36, Ca46, Ca48 e Os186. Nier mostrou como a proporção de isótopos radioactivos de urânio e seus produtos de decomposição era um segundo método para estimar a idade das rochas. Durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial, com outros, ele mostrou (1940) que o urânio-235 mais raro sofre fissão, o que não é comum no U-238.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1917, o inventor e escritor americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Villchur">Edgar Villchur</a>. Ele ficou conhecido pela sua invenção em 1954 do altifalante de suspensão acústica que revolucionou o campo de equipamentos de alta fidelidade.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1930, o astrónomo americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Drake">Frank Drake</a>. Ele formulou a Equação com o seu nome para estimar o número de civilizações tecnológicas que podem existir na galáxia Via Láctea, N = R * × fp × ne × fl × fi × fc × L. Usando suposições plausíveis para os parâmetros, Drake concluiu que talvez 10 planetas na nossa galáxia possam ter sinais detectáveis originários da vida. Em 1960, Drake liderou a primeira pesquisa, o Projecto Ozma, de dois meses, para escutar padrões em ondas de rádio com um padrão complexo e ordenado, que se supõe representar mensagens de alguma inteligência extraterrestre. Carl Sagan e Drake projectaram as placas do Pioneer 10 e Pioneer 11 com o objectivo de cumprimentar e informar qualquer vida extraterrestre que pudesse encontrar os vasos depois que eles deixassem o sistema solar. Foi também fundador da iniciativa SETI (search for extraterrestrial intelligence).</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou a fundação Raspberry Pi anunciou uma nova versão da sua placa Raspberry Pi 4. Tendo o Raspberry Pi 4 quase um ano e tendo vendas de certa de 3 milhões de unidades vendidas foi apresentada mais uma variante deste modelo - uma placa Raspberry Pi 4 com 8GB de memória. Isto foi possível, porque o chip usado no Raspberry Pi 4 permite endereçar até 16GB de memória. Para comportar o necessário aumento de consumo energético foram também feitas alterações no sistema de alimentação da placa.</p>

<p>Também nesta que passou, abortou a tentativa de lançar pela primeira vez para o espaço astronautas dentro dum veiculo espacial construído pela SpaceX. O Crew Dragon deveria ter sido lançado com os astronautas Bob Behnken e Doug Hurley esta quarta-feira com destino à estação espacial Internacional mas as condições meteorológicas adversas impediram o lançamento. Vai ser feito uma nova tentativa já neste sábado 30 de Maio as 15:22 EST.</p>

<p>Por fim, nesta semana que passou a tentativa de lançamento do foguetão LauncherOne da Virgin Orbit, a partir de um avião, falhou. Após o foguetão ter sido largado do Boeing 747 - "Cosmic Girl" - não seguiu com o plano de voo e acabou por cair. O foguetão deveria cair por alguns segundos antes que o primeiro de seus dois estágios se inflamasse e o impulsionasse pela costa em direcção ao pólo sul para a inserção de sua carga de demonstração numa órbita baixa da Terra.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos assim como projetos de maker. São apresentadas as revistas MagPI Nº 94 de Junho e newselectronics de 26 de Maio.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/8gb-raspberry-pi-4-on-sale-now-at-75/">8GB Raspberry Pi 4 on sale now at $75</a></h2>

<p><em>"Raspberry Pi 4 is almost a year old, and it’s been a busy year. We’ve sold nearly 3 million units, shipped a couple of minor board revisions, and reduced the price of the 2GB variant from $45 to $35. On the software side, we’ve done enormous amounts of work to reduce the idle and loaded power consumption of the device, passed OpenGL ES 3.1 conformance, started work on a Vulkan driver, and shipped PXE network boot mode and a prototype of USB mass storage boot mode – all this alongside the usual round of bug fixes, feature additions, and kernel version bumps. While we launched with 1GB, 2GB and 4GB variants, even at that point we had our eye on the possibility of an 8GB Raspberry Pi 4. We were so enthusiastic about the idea that the non-existent product made its way into both the Beginner’s Guide and the compliance leaflet. The BCM2711 chip that we use on Raspberry Pi 4 can address up to 16GB of LPDDR4 SDRAM, so the real barrier to our offering a larger-memory variant was the lack of an 8GB LPDDR4 package."</em> <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/8gb-raspberry-pi-4-on-sale-now-at-75/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The historic launch planned for Wednesday gets pushed back due to stormy conditions, but the launch window remains open. SpaceX and NASA will try again Saturday. ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON, veteran astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley were scheduled to fly to the International Space Station in a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule. The Demo-2 mission was going to be the first crewed mission for SpaceX and the first time NASA astronauts have launched from the US in nine years. But the world will have to wait a few more days to see it happen. Just 17 minutes before launch, SpaceX scrubbed the mission due to bad weather around the launch site and along the capsule’s flight path."</em> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/weather-delays-the-spacex-crew-dragon-launch/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/26/richard-branson-virgin-orbit-rocket-test-launch-fails">Richard Branson’s Virgin Orbit rocket test launch fails</a></h2>

<p><em>"Richard Branson’s Virgin Orbit has failed in its first test launch of a new rocket carried by a Boeing 747 and released over the Pacific Ocean off the coast of southern California. The inaugural launch had appeared to be going well until moments after the rocket was dropped from beneath the left wing of the jumbo jet dubbed “Cosmic Girl”. The launch failure is the latest setback for Branson, who recently announced he was selling $500m (£405m) worth of shares in his space travel business Virgin Galactic – a sister company of Orbit – to help prop up his ailing aviation and leisure businesses. In its official Twitter commentary on the launch, Virgin Orbit said: “We’ve confirmed a clean release from the aircraft. However, the mission terminated shortly into the flight. Cosmic Girl and our flight crew are safe and returning to base.” There was no immediate explanation for what went wrong with the rocket, which carried a test satellite."</em> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/26/richard-branson-virgin-orbit-rocket-test-launch-fails">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4252.html">STMicroelectronics’ Latest Time-of-Flight Sensor Enables Multi-Object Ranging for Next-Gen Industrial and Personal Electronics Applications</a></h2>

<p><em>"STMicroelectronics, a world leader in Time-of-Flight (ToF) solutions with over one billion devices delivered for various applications, has extended the capabilities of its FlightSense™ ToF ranging sensors by introducing the VL53L3CX with patented histogram algorithms that allow measuring distances to multiple objects as well as increasing accuracy. The VL53L3CX measures object ranges from 2.5cm to 3m, unaffected by the target color or reflectance, unlike conventional infrared sensors. This allows designers to introduce powerful new features to their products, such as enabling occupancy detectors to provide error-free sensing by ignoring unwanted background or foreground objects, or reporting the exact distances to multiple targets within the sensor’s field-of-view. The ST patented histogram algorithms increase cover-glass crosstalk immunity and allow real-time smudge compensation preventing external contamination from adversely affecting the ranging accuracy of, for example, vacuum cleaners or equipment that may be used in a dusty industrial environment. Ranging under ambient lighting is also improved. In addition, the VL53L3CX has superior linearity that increases short-distance measurement accuracy enhancing wall tracking, faster cliff detection, and obstacle avoidance in equipment such as service robots and vacuum cleaners, markets in which ST has already enjoyed considerable commercial success."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4252.html">[...]</a>

As electric vehicles rapidly grow in popularity worldwide, there will soon be a wave of used batteries whose performance is no longer sufficient for vehicles that need reliable acceleration and range. But a new study shows that these batteries could still have a useful and profitable second life as backup storage for grid-scale solar photovoltaic installations, where they could perform for more than a decade in this less demanding role. The study, published in the journal Applied Energy, was carried out by six current and former MIT researchers, including postdoc Ian Mathews and professor of mechanical engineering Tonio Buonassisi, who is head of the Photovoltaics Research Laboratory. As a test case, the researchers examined in detail a hypothetical grid-scale solar farm in California. They studied the economics of several scenarios: building a 2.5-megawatt solar farm alone; building the same array along with a new lithium-ion battery storage system; and building it with a battery array made of repurposed EV batteries that had declined to 80 percent of their original capacity, the point at which they would be considered too weak for continued vehicle use."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2020/solar-energy-farms-electric-vehicle-batteries-life-0522">[...]</a>

Now, thanks to research conducted by the groups of statistical physics of SISSA – Scuola Internazionale Superiore di Studi Avanzati and the “Abdus Salam” International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP), that goal is closer to reach. “We have dealt with a gauge theory, more precisely the Schwinger model, which mathematically describes the interaction between microscopic charged particles, like electrons and positrons, and an electric field in one spatial dimension," said Federica Surace, PhD student at SISSA and lead author of the research, recently published on Physical Review X. “We have shown that this theory can be simulated in an experiment with ultracold atoms better than what calculators have done to date.

<p><em>"Astronomers have used mysterious fast radio bursts to solve a decades-old mystery of ‘missing matter’, long predicted to exist in the Universe but never detected—until now. The researchers have now found all of the missing ‘normal’ matter in the vast space between stars and galaxies, as detailed today in the journal Nature. Lead author Associate Professor Jean-Pierre Macquart, from the Curtin University node of the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR), said astronomers have been searching for the missing matter for almost thirty years. “We know from measurements of the Big Bang how much matter there was in the beginning of the Universe,” he said. “But when we looked out into the present Universe, we couldn’t find half of what should be there. It was a bit of an embarrassment.” “Intergalactic space is very sparse,” he said."</em> <a href="https://news.curtin.edu.au/media-releases/cosmic-bursts-unveil-universes-missing-matter/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.news.iastate.edu/news/2020/05/19/forbidden-light">Scientists use light to accelerate supercurrents, access forbidden light, quantum properties</a></h2>

<p><em>"Scientists are using light waves to accelerate supercurrents and access the unique properties of the quantum world, including forbidden light emissions that one day could be applied to high-speed, quantum computers, communications and other technologies. The scientists have seen unexpected things in supercurrents – electricity that moves through materials without resistance, usually at super cold temperatures – that break symmetry and are supposed to be forbidden by the conventional laws of physics, said Jigang Wang, a professor of physics and astronomy at Iowa State University, a senior scientist at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Ames Laboratory and the leader of the project. Wang’s lab has pioneered use of light pulses at terahertz frequencies– trillions of pulses per second – to accelerate electron pairs, known as Cooper pairs, within supercurrents. In this case, the researchers tracked light emitted by the accelerated electrons pairs. What they found were “second harmonic light emissions,” or light at twice the frequency of the incoming light used to accelerate electrons. That, Wang said, is analogous to color shifting from the red spectrum to the deep blue."</em> <a href="https://www.news.iastate.edu/news/2020/05/19/forbidden-light">[...]</a>

<p><em>"I've dabbled in wiring together my own little electrical projects over the years, mostly in the form of paperclips, aluminum foil, and cardboard cobbled together with hot glue. I recently bought a 3D printer (the Creality Ender 3) and went looking for a printable model that would let me create more reliable electrical components using the same common household metal. Most recently I needed an on-off switch that I could wire into a standard 2-pin computer fan being powered by an AC wall adapter. To my dismay, I could find only one printable model that didn't require ordering special metal parts for electronics (Hackaday), and the last update to that project revealed that it stopped working after some light use in 2016. But I thought the core function of their design looked promising, so I decided to take a shot at creating a similar simple electrical switch. After a couple days in Sketchup and several iterations, I've designed a (so far) reliable electrical switch that, besides the printable plastic housing, only requires about half of a large office paperclip for the conductive components."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/3D-Printed-Electric-Slide-Switch-Using-Only-a-Pape/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The usual approach to radiation detection is the use of a Geiger-Müller tube and its high voltage circuit requirements, but during a quick surf through the internet today, I came across this portable and “accurate looking” solution developed by Stefan Wagner, on EasyEDA. Rather than the Geiger Muller tube and its complex circuitry, the project uses a miniature Silicon PIN Photodiode, the 3x BPW34 (which were connected in parallel to improve sensitivity), as the primary sensing component. The BPW34 is a PIN photodiode with high speed and high radiant sensitivity in miniature, flat, top view, clear plastic package. It is sensitive to visible and near-infrared radiation and has a small sensitive area, which is an advantage in radiation detection, as the background rate due to cosmic rays is very low, and signals from small samples will be easier to detect than when a counter tube is used. The behavior of the BPW34 PIN photodiode used in the project is similar to that of a low-cost counter tube in the sense that, while alpha particles may be stopped by the enclosure of the device, gamma rays due to their high penetration ability will pass through and create electron-hole pairs in the depletion layer of the diode. This will lead to the charge carriers in the diode being drawn away and a small current pulse being created."</em> <a href="https://www.electronics-lab.com/bpw34-gamma-ray-detector/">[...]</a>

A bit of data sheet research reveals the reason: white LEDs have a forward voltage of 3.2 V, so a 3 V supply is simply not enough to let them light up properly.

<p><em>"I recently found myself binge-watching a lot of Netflix series due to the current situation, I hope you all are safe, and I saw that season 5 of the Black Mirror was released. An anthology series that revolves around a group of people's personal lives and how technology manipulates their behavior. And one of the episodes that caught my attention was Rachel, Jack, and Ashley Too. One of the main characters of this series is a home robot named Ashley O and that robot has a lot of character around it and I thought for myself I should build one, it's a good project to getting started with programming if not that then at least I can program it to laughs at my jokes.!

<p><em>"EscoriaBot is a robot made with recycled material and Arduino electronics. Since I saw R2-D2 more than 40 years ago in my childhood I wanted to have a robot. But there was a great barrier between me and my dreams, the Electronics and this problem remained for many more years. As a user, an advocate of free software, I had heard of arduino but it seemed too difficult for me until my friend Gustavo helped me choose my first kit. I put it together and kept going. I did not like the chassis because it was stuck with any obstacle I decided to make my own chassis And it worked but I wanted something more powerful So I started looking for alternatives and researching I found several YouTube channels such as The Post Apocalyptic Inventor or Espacio de César where I realized that I could take advantage of many discard devices and incidentally make the planet cleaner."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/elpagano/escoriabot-fdc99e">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A cost-effective and open source system to data log health measurements in Google sheets and allows the doctor to monitor them from anywhere Coronavirus disease, also known as COVID-19, is an infectious disease which spreads between humans. The incubation period of coronavirus is on average 5 - 6 days, but it could also be up to 14 days. During this incubation period, before the person begins experiencing symptoms, the person could be contagious. The virus would spread to the people with whom the infected person is interacting, and this is dangerous. The presence of coronavirus in a human's body could be tested by carrying out PCR tests. The demand for PCR tests is increasing, but the tests cannot be carried everywhere."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/RUCKSIKAA/covid-19-remote-health-monitoring-system-iot-33b8a3">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Display any picture or text on a 32x64 LED panel with just an Arduino Nano! The beginning The actual first time I worked with such a panel was on the 36C3 in the end of 2019, when a friend of mine tried to get them running with an esp32. I wanted to also do some fun things with such a panel, so I got myself a 32x64 P.3 RGB LED panel. January 22nd, I got this panel in the mail, and having no other controller on my hand back then I just wanted to get it working with the NANO. I've seen many libraries and projects with the UNO and a 16x32 panel, but everything this size was always run by a teensy or a pi. I looked for Libraries, but couldn't find any."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/CamelCaseName/running-a-32x64-rgb-led-panel-with-only-an-arduino-nano-c19385">[...]</a>
