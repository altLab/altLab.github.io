<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1840, o físico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Abbe">Ernst Abbe</a> responsável por estabelecer uma base técnica e teórica para o desenho de instrumentos ópticos. A condição "Abbe sine" permitiu projectar lentes sem a distorção de aberração esférica da imagem. Ele inventou o sistema de lentes apocromáticas (1868) e adicionou a lente do condensador Abbe para melhorar a iluminação do microscópio (1870). Ele usou imersão homogénea de amostra e objetiva de microscópio em óleo de cedro com índice de refracção correspondente para obter maior ampliação. Ele inventou o refratómetro Abbe para medir um índice de refracção. A partir de 1866, ele colaborou com Carl Zeiss para produzir instrumentos ópticos de alta qualidade. Ele tornou-se o único proprietário dos trabalhos ópticos da Zeiss em 1888. A Partir de 1878, ele também foi director dos observatórios astronómicos e meteorológicos da Universidade de Jena.
Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1862, o matemático <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert">David Hilbert</a> que reduziu a geometria a uma série de axiomas e contribuiu substancialmente para o estabelecimento dos fundamentos formalistas da matemática. No seu livro, Foundations of Geometry, ele apresentou o primeiro conjunto completo de axiomas desde Euclides. O seu trabalho em 1909 sobre equações integrais levou à pesquisa do século XX em análise funcional (na qual as funções são estudadas em grupos). Hoje, o nome de Hilbert é muitas vezes lembrado pelo conceito de espaço de Hilbert na física quântica, um espaço de dimensões infinitas.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que o Rover Curiosity sofreu um problema que lhe provocou um congelamento temporário. Ao ter perdido o seu "sentido" de orientação o Rover Curiosity por questões de segurança parou no local onde se encontrava até que possa novamente "saber" onde se encontra. Tendo mantido-se continuamente em contacto com a missão que o acompanha na Terra os engenheiros da equipa conceberam um plano para recuperar o Rover deste problema e para perceber o que o levou a esta situação. O plano foi aplicado com sucesso e o Rover voltou a estar totalmente operacional para continuar a explorar Marte fazendo as suas experiências cientificas.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. É apresentada a revista Hackspace Magazine Nº27 de Fevereiro e o livro "Think Python".</p>

<p><em>"Knowing where our bodies are helps us move through the world. We know if we are standing or sitting, if our arms are out or by our sides (or for some people, not there at all). This body awareness is essential for staying safe. Rovers also need to know where their bodies are relative to their surroundings. Curiosity stores its body attitude in memory, things like the orientation of each joint, which instrument on the end of its arm is pointing down, and how close APXS is to the ground. It also stores its knowledge of the environment, things like how steep the slope is, where the big rocks are, and where the bedrock sticks out in a dangerous way."</em> <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission-updates/8587/sols-2649-2652-curiosity-loses-its-attitude/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"NASA and SpaceX completed a launch escape demonstration of the company’s Crew Dragon spacecraft and Falcon 9 rocket Sunday. This was the final major flight test of the spacecraft before it begins carrying astronauts to the International Space Station under NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. The launch escape test began at 10:30 a.m. EST with liftoff from historic Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on a mission to show the spacecraft’s capability to safely separate from the rocket in the unlikely event of an inflight emergency. “This critical flight test puts us on the cusp of returning the capability to launch astronauts in American spacecraft on American rockets from American soil,” said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. “We are thrilled with the progress NASA’s Commercial Crew Program is making and look forward to the next milestone for Crew Dragon.” As part of the test, SpaceX configured Crew Dragon to trigger a launch escape about 1.5 minutes after liftoff. All major functions were executed, including separation, engine firings, parachute deployment and landing."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-spacex-complete-final-major-flight-test-of-crew-spacecraft">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.microchip.com/en/pressreleasepage/next-generation-miniaturized-rubidium-atomic-clock">Next-Generation Miniaturized Rubidium Atomic Clock Improves Performance and adds Features without Increasing Size</a></h2>

<p><em>"Microchip releases MAC-SA5X, enhancing its Miniature Atomic Clock (MAC) technology to deliver wider temperature range and rapid warm-up time As reliance on precise frequency and timing increases due to the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) enabling 5G communication networks, data centers and other mission critical infrastructure, smaller size and high-performance atomic clock technology has become essential to support both military and commercial applications. To meet demand for a small footprint atomic clock, Microchip Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP) today announced the industry’s highest performance atomic clock for its size and power. The new device also delivers a wider thermal range, critical performance improvements and other enhancements over previously available technology. Microchip’s next-generation MAC-SA5X miniaturized rubidium atomic clock produces a stable time and frequency reference that maintains a high degree of synchronization to a reference clock, such as a GNSS-derived signal. Its combination of low monthly drift rate, short-term stability and stability during temperature changes allow the device to maintain precise frequency and timing requirements during extended periods of holdover during GNSS outages or for applications where large rack-mount clocks are not possible. Operating over a wider temperature range of -40 to +75 Celsius, the MAC-SA5X was designed to quickly achieve atomic stability performance by taking less time to lock compared to some of the existing clock technology available in the market."</em> <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en/pressreleasepage/next-generation-miniaturized-rubidium-atomic-clock">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Placed at 4,300 m above sea level in Hanle, Ladakh, MACE is also the world's second largest gamma-ray telescope, with a 21-m-diameter dish. India’s largest and the world’s highest gamma-ray telescope is set to go live later this year, aiming to provide a new window into distant stars and galaxies in the universe. The Major Atmospheric Cherenkov Experiment Telescope (MACE) in Hanle, Ladakh, is placed at an altitude of 4,300 metres above sea level. It is the world’s second-largest, ground-based gamma-ray telescope with a 21-metre-diameter dish. The largest telescope of the same class is the 28-metre-diameter telescope, which is part of the High Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS) in Namibia. “The installation of the telescope is complete and trial runs are being carried out."</em> <a href="https://theprint.in/science/worlds-highest-and-indias-largest-gamma-ray-telescope-to-go-live-in-ladakh-this-year/353064/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"It’s a tantalizing prospect for traders whose success often hinges on microseconds: a desktop PC algorithm that crunches market data faster than today’s most advanced supercomputers. Japan’s Toshiba Corp. says it has the technology to make such rapid-fire calculations a reality -- not quite quantum computing, but perhaps the next best thing. The claim is being met with a mix of intrigue and skepticism at financial firms in Tokyo and around the world. Toshiba’s “Simulated Bifurcation Algorithm” is designed to harness the principles behind quantum computers without requiring the use of such machines, which currently have limited applications and can cost millions of dollars to build and keep near absolute zero temperature. Toshiba says its technology, which may also have uses outside finance, runs on PCs made from off-the-shelf components. “You can just plug it into a server and run it at room temperature,” Kosuke Tatsumura, a senior research scientist at Toshiba’s Computer &amp; Network Systems Laboratory, said in an interview."</em> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2020-01-16/toshiba-says-it-built-an-algo-that-s-faster-than-a-supercomputer">[...]</a>

<p><em>"DirecTV is racing to move its Spaceway-1 satellite out of the geostationary arc after the 15-year-old satellite suffered a crippling battery malfunction that the company fears could cause it to explode. DirecTV told the U.S. Federal Communications Commission that it does not have time to deplete the remaining fuel on Spaceway-1 before disposing of it by boosting it 300 kilometers above the geostationary arc, a region home to most of the world’s large communications satellites. Spaceway-1 is a Boeing-built High Power 702 model satellite that was designed to last 12 years. Launched in 2005 on a Sea Launch Zenit 3SL rocket, the 6,080-kilogram satellite originally provided high-definition television direct broadcasting services from its orbital slot at 102.8 degrees west longitude. More recently, Spaceway-1 was being used to backup Ka-band capacity over Alaska. In December, an unexplained anomaly caused “significant and irreversible thermal damage” to Spaceway-1’s batteries, DirecTV said in a filing dated Jan. 19."</em> <a href="https://spacenews.com/directv-fears-explosion-risk-from-satellite-with-damaged-battery/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) today announced the successful completion of its previously announced offer to exchange all outstanding shares of common stock of Maxwell Technologies, Inc. (“Maxwell”) for 0.0193 of a share of Tesla common stock, together with cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Tesla common stock, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. The exchange offer expired at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on Wednesday, May 15, 2019. As of the expiration of the exchange offer, a total of approximately 36,764,342 shares of common stock of Maxwell were validly tendered in the exchange offer and not validly withdrawn, representing approximately 79% of the aggregate voting power of the shares of Maxwell common stock outstanding immediately after the consummation of the exchange offer. All shares of Maxwell common stock that were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to the expiration of the offer have been accepted by Tesla for payment in accordance with the terms of the exchange offer. Following to the completion of the exchange offer, Tesla completed the acquisition of Maxwell by consummating the second step merger contemplated by the previously announced merger agreement between Tesla and Maxwell. As a result of this merger, all shares of Maxwell stock that were not tendered in Tesla’s exchange offer were cancelled in exchange for the right to receive the same consideration paid for Maxwell stock in the exchange offer."</em> <a href="https://ir.tesla.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tesla-completes-acquisition-maxwell-technologies">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Understanding sequential data — such as language, music or videos — is a challenging task, especially when there is dependence on extensive surrounding context. For example, if a person or an object disappears from view in a video only to re-appear much later, many models will forget how it looked. In the language domain, long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks cover enough context to translate sentence-by-sentence. In this case, the context window (i.e., the span of data taken into consideration in the translation) covers from dozens to about a hundred words. The more recent Transformer model not only improved performance in sentence-by-sentence translation, but could be used to generate entire Wikipedia articles through multi-document summarization. This is possible because the context window used by Transformer extends to thousands of words."</em> <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/01/reformer-efficient-transformer.html">[...]</a>

Scientists have been trying to transfer these features to artificial skin for a long time, aiming at robotic applications. Operation of robotic systems heavily rely on electronic and magnetic field sensing functionalities required for positioning and orientation in space. A lot of research and development have been devoted into implementation of these functionalities in a flexible and compliant form."</em> <a href="https://www.ifw-dresden.de/news-events/news-detail-view/news/integrate-micro-chips-for-electronic-skin/?tx_news_pi1%5Bcontroller%5D=News&amp;tx_news_pi1%5Baction%5D=detail&amp;cHash=1f2b42d88197d6408ddbe2413d3c782d">[...]</a>

A model invented by researchers at MIT and Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI) that uses satellite imagery to tag road features in digital maps could help improve GPS navigation. Showing drivers more details about their routes can often help them navigate in unfamiliar locations. Lane counts, for instance, can enable a GPS system to warn drivers of diverging or merging lanes. Incorporating information about parking spots can help drivers plan ahead, while mapping bicycle lanes can help cyclists negotiate busy city streets. Providing updated information on road conditions can also improve planning for disaster relief."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2020/artificial-intelligence-digital-maps-0123">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A team from the Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory has conducted a series of experiments to gain a better understanding of quantum mechanics and pursue advances in quantum networking and quantum computing, which could lead to practical applications in cybersecurity and other areas. ORNL quantum researchers Joseph Lukens, Pavel Lougovski, Brian Williams, and Nicholas Peters—along with collaborators from Purdue University and the Technological University of Pereira in Colombia—summarized results from several of their recent academic papers in a special issue of the Optical Society’s Optics &amp; Photonics News, which showcased some of the most significant results from optics-related research in 2019. Their entry was one of 30 selected for publication from a pool of 91. Conventional computer “bits” have a value of either 0 or 1, but quantum bits, called “qubits,” can exist in a superposition of quantum states labeled 0 and 1. This ability makes quantum systems promising for transmitting, processing, storing, and encrypting vast amounts of information at unprecedented speeds. To study photons—single particles of light that can act as qubits—the researchers employed light sources called quantum optical frequency combs that contain many precisely defined wavelengths."</em> <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/news/quantum-experiments-explore-power-light-communications-computing">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Smaller is better when it comes to microchips, researchers said, and by using 3D components on a standardized 2D microchip manufacturing platform, developers can use up to 100 times less chip space. A team of engineers has boosted the performance of its previously developed 3D inductor technology by adding as much as three orders of magnitudes more induction to meet the performance demands of modern electronic devices. In a study led by Xiuling Li, an electrical and computer engineering professor at the University of Illinois and interim director of the Holonyak Micro and Nanotechnology Laboratory, engineers introduce a microchip inductor capable of tens of millitesla-level magnetic induction. Using fully integrated, self-rolling magnetic nanoparticle-filled tubes, the technology ensures a condensed magnetic field distribution and energy storage in 3D space – all while keeping the tiny footprint needed to fit on a chip. The findings of the study are published in the journal Science Advances. Traditional microchip inductors are relatively large 2D spirals of wire, with each turn of the wire producing stronger inductance."</em> <a href="https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/805644">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Protected by the Gran Sasso massif from radiation coming from space, and thus immersed in what is called cosmic silence, Borexino is the purest experiment in the world for the measurement of neutrinos, not only those coming from the Sun but also those coming from bowels of the Earth, the so-called geoneutrinos. After more than ten years of acquisition and a sophisticated data analysis, the international collaboration that leads the experiment of the INFN Gran Sasso National Laboratories has published the new results on geoneutrinos in the journal Physical Review D. The article has been selected as Editors' Suggestion, among the papers considered of major importance and scientific interest. "For the first time the signal of neutrinos produced by the radioactive decay processes of uranium and thorium distributed in the Earth's mantle has been clearly observed, allowing to exclude the absence of radioactivity in the depths of the Earth with 99% probability", explains Gioacchino Ranucci, researcher of the INFN Section of Milan and co-manager of the scientific collaboration Borexino. The published result shows that much of the heat given off by the bowels of the Earth derives from the radioactive decay of uranium-238 and thorium-232 present in the Earth's mantle, almost 3,000 km thick, on which rests the thin crust we walk over. In fact, Borexino researchers estimated with a high probability (about 85%) that radioactive decays in rocks produce more than half of the earth's heat, with a predominant role of the mantle compared to the crust. This evidence opens up new scenarios in the global geochemical exploration of our planet."</em> <a href="https://www.lngs.infn.it/en/news/geoneutrinos-confirm-that-we-rest-on-a-mantle-filled-with-uranium-and-thorium">[...]</a>

Despite the seeming irrationality of these concepts, scientists over the last 120 years have demonstrated that this realm — known as quantum mechanics — is the foundation on which our physical existence is built. It is one of the most successful theories in modern science.

It’s originally for showing signal level in audio circuits, but there’s no reason you can’t use it to show temperature, rain intensity, light level, or whatever other value you are measuring. In the video above, I added a potentiometer as a voltage divider between 9V and 0V, so that the output would be somewhere in between. This way I could easily test the VU meter.
