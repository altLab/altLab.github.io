<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1802, o inventor americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Davenport_(inventor)">Thomas Davenport</a>. Ele é considerado o inventor do que provavelmente foi o primeiro motor eléctrico comercialmente bem-sucedido, que ele usou com grande talento para alimentar uma série de invenções. Embora vários outros inventores tenham experimentado motores, Davenport foi o primeiro a obter uma patente nos EUA (nº 132 em 25 de Fevereiro de 1837) para seu motor de corrente contínua. Ele incorporou o conceito do electroíman inventado por Joseph Henry de uma maneira que produziu um movimento rotativo usando sua própria ideia de comutador e escovas para controlar a direcção do fluxo da corrente. Ele usou um motor que construiu para alimentar máquinas de oficina e também construiu o primeiro vagão de comboio eléctrico.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1819 o inventor americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elias_Howe">Elias Howe</a>. Ele inventou uma máquina de costura comercialmente bem-sucedida. Embora tenha sido Walter Hunt quem construiu a primeira máquina de costura dos Estados Unidos, ele não a perseguiu. Mais tarde, Howe passou anos a desenvolver um desenho funcional e recebeu uma patente na sua própria máquina em 10 de Setembro de 1846. O sucesso comercial veio lentamente, exigindo a defesa da sua patente contra a melhor máquina comercializada por Isaac Singer.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1894, o engenheiro e inventor americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Spencer">Percy Spencer</a>. Ele teve a ideia do forno de micro-ondas. Em 1940, Sir John Randall e o Dr. H. A. Boot inventaram o tubo de magnetron para produzir micro-ondas por radar. Após a guerra, o Dr. Percy Spencer, da Raytheon Company, estava a investigar o tubo de magnetron. Durante uma experiência, ele descobriu que uma barra de chocolate no bolso tinha derretido totalmente. Como o efeito de aquecimento das micro-ondas era conhecido anteriormente, o Dr. Spencer deduziu que a radiação magnetron derretera o chocolate, não o calor do corpo. Isso levou Spencer a pesquisar alimentos para cozinhar. Os primeiros fornos comerciais de micro-ondas eram equipamentos de grande porte, feitos para restaurantes.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1911, o físico americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Archibald_Wheeler">John Archibald Wheeler</a>. Ele foi o primeiro físico americano envolvido no desenvolvimento teórico da bomba atómica. Ele também deu origem a uma nova abordagem da teoria do campo unificado. Wheeler recebeu o Prémio Wolf de 1997 "pelas suas contribuições para a física dos buracos negros, a gravidade quântica e as teorias de espalhamento nuclear e fissão nuclear". Depois de reconhecer que qualquer grande colecção de matéria fria não tem escolha a não ser ceder à força da gravidade e sofrer colapso total, Wheeler cunhou o termo "buraco negro" em 1967.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1926,o Físico americano-dinamarquês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Roy_Mottelson">Ben Roy Mottelson</a>. Ele partilhou o Prémio Nobel de Física de 1975 com Aage N. Bohr e James Rainwater "pela descoberta da conexão entre movimento colectivo e movimento de partículas nos núcleos atómicos e pelo desenvolvimento da teoria da estrutura do núcleo atómico com base nessa conexão". Este trabalho determinou as formas assimétricas de certos núcleos atómicos e as razões por trás dessas assimetrias. Pesquisas posteriores investigaram o facto de que a matéria nuclear possui propriedades remanescentes dos super-condutores.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1938, o cientista americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_B._Pollack">James B. Pollack</a>. Ele foi o investigador da NASA e ajudou a desenvolver a teoria de que a guerra atómica resultaria num "inverno nuclear" como um especialista de renome mundial no estudo de atmosferas e partículas planetárias usando técnicas de transferência radioactiva. Noutro trabalho, ele examinou as mudanças climáticas evolutivas em todos os planetas terrestres e modelos detalhados da evolução inicial dos planetas gigantes de gás. Ele fez contribuições fundamentais para o desenho de várias missões da NASA. Pollack descobriu a primeira evidência real de que as nuvens de Vénus são compostas de ácido sulfúrico. Ele explicou a razão do paradoxo dos anéis de Saturno mostrarem baixa emissividade de micro-ondas, mas alta reflectividade de radar.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou, a missão da Rocket Lab não conseguiu atingir a órbita tendo falhado. Após uma descolagem bem-sucedida, passagem do primeiro estágio e separação do estágio, o Rocket Lab teve uma anomalia durante a sua 13ª missão Electron: ‘Pics Or It Didn’t Happen.’
O problema ocorreu aproximadamente quatro minutos após o lançamento a 4 de Julho de 2020 e resultou na perda do foguetão. Como resultado, a carga a bordo do Electron não foi colocada em órbita. O Electron permaneceu dentro das zonas estabelecidas para a missão e não causou danos ao pessoal ou ao local de lançamento. O Rocket Lab está a trabalhar em estreita colaboração com a FAA para investigar a anomalia e identificar a raiz do problema para o corrigir e avançar.</p>

<p>Também esta semana ficámos a saber que os balões Loon da Alphabet começaram a oferecer o seu primeiro serviço comercial de Internet no Quénia. Num post no blog anunciando a notícia, o CEO da Loon, Alastair Westgarth, disse que o serviço 4G LTE será fornecido aos assinantes da Telkom Kenya através de uma frota de cerca de 35 balões, cobrindo uma área de cerca de 50.000 quilómetros quadrados nas áreas oeste e central do país, incluindo sua capital, Nairobi.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos assim como projetos de maker. É apresentado o livro "Building Secure &amp; Reliable Systems".</p>

<p><em>"Following a successful lift-off, first stage burn, and stage separation, Rocket Lab experienced an anomaly during its 13th Electron mission ‘Pics Or It Didn’t Happen.’ The issue occurred approximately four minutes into the flight on July 4, 2020 and resulted in the safe loss of the vehicle. As a result, the payloads onboard Electron were not deployed to orbit. Electron remained within the predicted launch corridors and caused no harm to personnel or the launch site. Rocket Lab is working closely with the FAA to investigate the anomaly and identify its root cause to correct the issue to move forward. “We are deeply sorry to our customers Spaceflight Inc., Canon Electronics Inc., Planet, and In-Space Missions for the loss of their payloads. We know many people poured their hearts and souls into those spacecraft."</em> <a href="https://www.rocketlabusa.com/news/updates/rocket-lab-mission-fails-to-reach-orbit/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/7/21315961/alphabet-loon-balloons-internet-kenya-telkom-4g-remote-areas">Alphabet’s Loon balloons provide their first commercial internet service in Kenya</a></h2>

<p><em>"A 35-balloon fleet will provide internet across 50,000 square kilometers Alphabet’s Loon division, which uses floating balloons to provide internet, has today launched its first commercial service in Kenya. In a blog post announcing the news, Loon’s CEO Alastair Westgarth said that the 4G LTE service will be provided to Telkom Kenya subscribers via a fleet of around 35 balloons, covering an area of around 50,000 square kilometers across western and central areas of the country, including its capital, Nairobi. It’s a significant step for Loon, which started as a moonshot project in Alphabet’s X division before being spun out into its own company in 2018. The company’s balloons have already provided internet connectivity in the wake of disasters, like in Puerto Rico in 2017 after Hurricane Maria or in Peru after an earthquake in 2019, but never as part of a large-scale commercial deployment. Loon has been testing its balloons in Kenya for several months now, and it says that in that time, it’s already connected 35,000 unique users to the internet, “although most didn’t realize it.” The company says that it achieved a downlink speed of 18.9Mbps back in June, along with an uplink speed of 4.74Mbps and a latency of 19ms, and that it’s tested a range of services — including email, voice and video calls, web browsing, WhatsApp, and YouTube viewing — on its service. The company’s balloons (or “flight vehicles” as it calls them) hover at a height of roughly 20 km, analyzing the weather to ride around on stratospheric winds."</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/7/21315961/alphabet-loon-balloons-internet-kenya-telkom-4g-remote-areas">[...]</a>

Proba-V was launched in 2013 to fill a gap in global vegetation monitoring between the end of France’s Spot satellites and Copernicus Sentinel-3. Its compact Vegetation instrument has a 2250-km wide continent-scale field of view, allowing it to image all Earth’s vegetation in just over a single day. Overall, the mission has acquired more than a petabyte of environmental data during its time in orbit, which was processed and distributed to users by VITO, the Belgian research and service centre. Its observing mission having ended at the end of June, Proba-V will now to free to perform experimental monitoring over Europe and Africa – including co-observations with new companion missions.

<p><em>"ESA’s Euclid mission has reached another milestone on its journey towards launch. Its two instruments are now built and fully tested. These have been delivered to Airbus Defence and Space in Toulouse, France, where they are now being integrated with the telescope to form the mission’s payload module. Euclid consists of a 1.2-metre mirror telescope that is designed to work at both visible and near-infrared wavelengths – the latter being just longer than the red light humans can see. The telescope will collect light from distant cosmic objects and feed it into two instruments. The Visible instrument (VIS) and the Near Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) will run in parallel, recording data simultaneously from whatever portion of the sky the telescope is pointed at."</em> <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/The_Euclid_space_telescope_is_coming_together">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.inrs.ca/english/actualites/towards-lasers-powerful-enough-investigate-new-kind-physics">Towards Lasers Powerful Enough to Investigate a New Kind of Physics</a></h2>

<p><em>"In a paper that made the cover of the journal Applied Physics Letters, an international team of researchers has demonstrated an innovative technique for increasing the intensity of lasers. This approach, based on the compression of light pulses, would make it possible to reach a threshold intensity for a new type of physics that has never been explored before: quantum electrodynamics phenomena. Since the invention of frequency drift amplification in 1985 by Donna Strickland and Gérard Mourou, laser power has increased phenomenally, to finally reach a limit in the last years. Many research groups are amplifying the energy of the laser to increase its power, but this approach is expensive and requires beams and optics that are very large, more than a metre in size. Researchers Jean-Claude Kieffer of the Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS), E. A. Khazanov of the Institute of Applied Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences and Gérard Mourou, Professor Emeritus of the Ecole Polytechnique in France, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2018, have chosen another direction to achieve an intensity of around 10^23 W/cm². Rather than increasing the energy of the laser, they decrease the pulse duration to only a few femtoseconds."</em> <a href="http://www.inrs.ca/english/actualites/towards-lasers-powerful-enough-investigate-new-kind-physics">[...]</a>

A team of researchers, affiliated with UNIST has come up with a novel electrode that could greatly improve the stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the most promising candidate for the next generation solar cells due to their low cost and high power conversion efficiency. This is because inserting a protection layer between the metal-based electrode and the perovskite film can prevent metal-induced degradation and that graphene, as such a layer, can effectively suppress the diffusion of metals and halide ions. This breakthrough has been led by Professor Hyesung Park and his research team in the School of Energy and Chemical Engineering at UNIST. In their work, the research team developed a flexible metal grid-based hybrid electrode platform by using a Cu grid-embedded polyimide (CEP) film with a graphene sheet as the protection layer, named GCEP, which exhibited high electrical conductivity, excellent chemical stability, and mechanical durability. Through this, they demonstrated the critical role of graphene as a protection layer to prevent metal-induced degradation and halide diffusion between the electrode and perovskite layer."</em> <a href="https://news.unist.ac.kr/enhancing-the-performance-of-pscs-with-graphene-armor/">[...]</a>

The method may be useful in applications where traditional temperature probes won’t work, like monitoring semiconductor performance or next-generation nuclear reactors. Many temperature sensors measure thermal radiation, most of which is in the infrared spectrum, coming off the surface of an object. The hotter the object, the more radiation it emits, which is the basis for gadgets like thermal imaging cameras. Depth thermography, however, goes beyond the surface and works with a certain class of materials that are partially transparent to infrared radiation. “We can measure the spectrum of thermal radiation emitted from the object and use a sophisticated algorithm to infer the temperature not just on the surface, but also underneath the surface, tens to hundreds of microns in,” says Mikhail Kats, a UW–Madison professor of electrical and computer engineering."</em> <a href="https://news.wisc.edu/new-method-measures-temperature-within-3d-objects/">[...]</a>

The study was published online today in Nature Nanotechnology. “We were very surprised to observe this state in 2D semiconductors because it has generally been assumed that they are too dirty and disordered to host this effect,” says Cory Dean, professor of physics at Columbia University. “Moreover, the FQHS sequence in our experiment reveals unexpected and interesting new behavior that we’ve never seen before, and in fact suggests that 2D semiconductors are close-to-ideal platforms to study FQHS further.” The fractional quantum Hall state is a collective phenomenon that comes about when researchers confine electrons to move in a thin two-dimensional plane, and subject them to large magnetic fields. First discovered in 1982, the fractional quantum Hall effect has been studied for more than 40 years, yet many fundamental questions still remain."</em> <a href="https://engineering.columbia.edu/press-releases/hone-2d-semiconductors-quantum-computing">[...]</a>

<p><em>"n an effort to improve large touchscreens, LED light panels and window-mounted infrared solar cells, researchers at the University of Michigan have made plastic conductive while also making it more transparent. They provide a recipe to help other researchers find the best balance between conductivity and transparency by creating a three-layer anti-reflection surface. The conductive metal layer is sandwiched between two “dielectric” materials that allow light to pass through easily. The dielectrics reduce the reflection from both the plastic and metal layer between them. “We developed a way to make coatings with high transparency and conductivity, low haze, excellent flexibility, easy fabrication and great compatibility with different surfaces,” said Jay Guo, U-M professor of electrical engineering and computer science, who led the work. Previously, Guo’s team had shown that it was possible to add a layer of metal onto a plastic sheet to make it conductive—a very thin layer of silver that, by itself, reduced the transmission of light by roughly 10%."</em> <a href="https://news.umich.edu/making-plastic-more-transparent-while-also-adding-electrical-conductivity/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"When you switch on a standard light bulb, the light from it radiates outwards in all directions in much the same way as rings form when a stone is dropped into a pond. Similarly, as the ripples on the pond become weaker the further they travel, the light produced by the bulb diminishes – or dissipates – rapidly the further it gets from the source. But in a breakthrough discovery, scientists have found that paired layers of certain ultra-thin, nanomaterials can – when twisted out of alignment in a particular way – manipulate the flow of light in extreme ways. The scientists behind the discovery say it is a major step towards developing ultra-fast nanocomputers, using narrow beams of light to compress massive processing power into a far smaller space than today’s highest capacity processors. The precise positioning of the twisted layers needed to achieve the effect varies according to the frequency of the light source used and has been dubbed by researchers the “magic angle”. In this position, the material forces the light into tightly focused and highly-controllable beams."</em> <a href="https://www.eng.nus.edu.sg/news/breakthrough-shows-magic-angle-twistronics-principle-can-also-manipulate-light/">[...]</a>

This means that while the DigiPot itself can be controlled by the output voltage of an Arduino, the signal that is passed thru the resistor network works with a far greater range of voltage (up to 36 volts). Most DigiPots that can be controlled by 5 volts are limited to 5 volts across the resistor network which restricts their usage for retrofitting an existing circuit that operates on higher voltage such as what you would find in a car or boat."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/MCP41HVX1-Digital-Potentiometer-for-Arduino/">[...]</a>

As seen in the images above, this project will be a scaled up version of a seven segment display which is most commonly used in the vast majority of digital clocks. In the real version, each of the seven segments can be independently controlled to form the numbers zero through nine. Although these displays come in a variety of sizes, the one I modeled this project after is aproximately 1cm X 2cm. However, since this Instructable was created with the intention of being entered into the Super-Size Speed Challenge, the one we'll be constructing is approximately 13cm X 20cm. Since this project utilizes an RGB floodlight it can display a wide number of shades and brightnesses."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Super-Sized-RGB-Seven-Segment-Display-Lamp/">[...]</a>
