<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1805, o matemático alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Gustav_Lejeune_Dirichlet">Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet</a>. Tendo feito valiosas contribuições para teoria dos números, análise e mecânica, Dirichlet é mais conhecido pelos seus trabalhos sobre condições para a convergência de séries trigonométricas e o uso das séries para representar funções arbitrárias. Ele, em 1837, propôs a definição moderna de uma função. Em mecânica, ele investigou o equilíbrio de sistemas e a teoria do potencial. Isso levou-o ao problema de Dirichlet, relativo às funções harmónicas com determinadas condições de fronteira. Dirichlet é considerado o fundador da teoria das séries de Fourier, tendo corrigido os erros anteriores de outros investigadores nos escritos de Fourier. Um dos seus alunos era Riemann. Em 1855, ele sucedeu Carl Friedrich Gauss na Universidade de Göttingen.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1834, o químico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Caro">Heinrich Caro</a>. Ele inventou novos processos químicos industriais que permitiram à empresa alemã BASF (Badische Anilin und Soda Fabrik) tornar-se o principal fabricante de corantes sintéticos durante duas décadas, a partir de 1869. Antes de se juntar a eles (1866), ele beneficiou do tempo que passou na Inglaterra, trabalhando em malveína (o primeiro corante sintético) e aprendendo sobre os novos corantes sintéticos que William Perkins tinha desenvolvido. Caro melhorou esses métodos de síntese e impulsionou a ascensão da indústria alemã de corantes, que levou ao domínio mais amplo da Alemanha na química industrial e ao surgimento do laboratório de pesquisa industrial. Ele ajudou a sintetizar a alizarina artificial (um corante natural), descobriu o azul de metileno (1877), o primeiro corante azo ácido (1878) e o poderoso agente oxidante, o ácido de Caro, o H2SO5 (1898).</p>

<p>Faz igual hoje anos que nascia, em 1910, o físico e inventor norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shockley">William Shockley</a>. Juntamente com John Bardeen e Walter H. Brattain recebeu o prémio Nobel da física pelo desenvolvimento do transístor, um dispositivo que substituiu a menos eficiente válvula e deu origem à era da electrónica miniaturizada como a conhecemos hoje.</p>

<p>Por fim, nascia em 1923, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Yeager">Chuck Yeager</a>. Este Piloto norte-americano alcançou inúmeros recordes de velocidade, dos quais o mais famoso é o primeiro voo tripulado mais rápido que o som. O Bell X-1 foi construído como um avião de pesquisa para atingir velocidades e altitudes extremas. Em 14 de Outubro de 1947, o X-1 foi levantado do chão num B-29 e transportado para 6.400 m. Ele soltou-se, disparando quatro foguetes de combustível líquido, o que o levou a uma velocidade supersónica de Mach 1,06 e a uma altitude máxima de 45.000 pés (13.700 m).</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou e numa colaboração entre a ESA e a NASA foi lançada a Solar Orbiter. Procurando uma visão dos pólos norte e sul do Sol, a Solar Orbiter viajará para fora do plano eclíptico - o cinturão do espaço, aproximadamente alinhado com o equador do Sol, através do qual os planetas orbitam. Passando pela Terra e repetidamente em volta de Vénus, a sonda aproximar-se-á do Sol e subirá mais acima da eclíptica até ter uma visão panorâmica dos pólos.</p>

<p>Também esta semana que passou ficámos a conhecer a nova versão do software Raspbian para o Raspberry PI. Esta distro baseada no Debian buster tem como principais alterações, melhorias ao nivel do gestor de ficheiros PCmanFM, do leitor de ecrã Orca, melhorias ao nivel do Scratch 3 e do Thonny e ainda no controlo de volume / mixer e a capacidade de instalar os jogos do livro "Code the Classics – Volume 1".</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. É apresentada também a revista newelectronics de 11 de Fevereiro.</p>

<p><em>"It will be a dark winter’s night when Solar Orbiter launches from Florida on its journey to the source of all light on Earth, the Sun. The mission, a collaboration between ESA (the European Space Agency) and NASA, is scheduled to begin Feb. 9, 2020, during a two-hour launch window that opens at 11:03 p.m. EST. The two-ton spacecraft launches from Cape Canaveral on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket. Seeking a view of the Sun’s north and south poles, Solar Orbiter will journey out of the ecliptic plane — the belt of space, roughly aligned with the Sun’s equator, through which the planets orbit. Slinging past Earth and repeatedly around Venus, the spacecraft will draw near the Sun and climb higher above the ecliptic until it has a bird’s eye view of the poles. There, Solar Orbiter will try to answer basic questions about the Sun, whose every burp and breeze holds sway over the solar system."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020/esa-nasa-solar-orbiter-launch-voyage-to-sun-heat-shield">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/a-new-raspbian-update/">A new Raspbian update</a></h2>

<p><em>"The last major release of Raspbian was the Buster version we launched alongside Raspberry Pi 4 last year. There was a minor release a couple of months later, which was mostly just bug-fixes for the first release (hence no blog post), but today’s release has a few changes that we thought it was worth bringing to your attention. File manager changes We previously made some significant changes to the PCmanFM file manager included as part of the Raspberry Pi Desktop; we added a cutdown mode which removes a lot of the less commonly used functions, and we set this as the default mode. One of the things we removed for this mode is the Places view, an optional view for the left-hand pane of the window which provides direct access to a few specific locations in the file system. We felt that the directory browser was more useful, so we chose to show that instead. But one useful feature of Places is that it displays external devices, such as USB drives, and these are somewhat awkward to find in the file manager otherwise."</em> <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/a-new-raspbian-update/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.arm.com/company/news/2020/02/new-ai-technology-from-arm">New AI technology from Arm delivers unprecedented on-device intelligence for IoT</a></h2>

<p><em>"Today, Arm announced significant additions to its artificial intelligence (AI) platform, including new machine learning (ML) IP, the Arm® Cortex®-M55 processor and Arm Ethos™-U55 NPU, the industry’s first microNPU (Neural Processing Unit) for Cortex-M, designed to deliver a combined 480x leap in ML performance to microcontrollers. The new IP and supporting unified toolchain enable AI hardware and software developers with more ways to innovate as a result of unprecedented levels of on-device ML processing for billions of small, power-constrained IoT and embedded devices. “Enabling AI everywhere requires device makers and developers to deliver machine learning locally on billions, and ultimately trillions of devices,” said Dipti Vachani, senior vice president and general manager, Automotive and IoT Line of Business, Arm. “With these additions to our AI platform, no device is left behind as on-device ML on the tiniest devices will be the new normal, unleashing the potential of AI securely across a vast range of life-changing applications.” As the IoT intersects with AI advancements and the rollout of 5G, more on-device intelligence means that smaller, cost-sensitive devices can be smarter and more capable while benefiting from greater privacy and reliability due to less reliance on the cloud or internet. By delivering this intelligence on microcontrollers designed securely from the ground up, Arm is reducing silicon and development costs and speeding up time to market for product manufacturers looking to efficiently enhance digital signal processing (DSP) and ML capabilities on-device. Arm Cortex-M55: Arm’s most AI-capable Cortex-M processor Cortex-M processors have become the computing platform of choice for developers, with Arm partners shipping more than 50 billion chips based on Cortex-M into a vast range of customer applications."</em> <a href="https://www.arm.com/company/news/2020/02/new-ai-technology-from-arm">[...]</a>

<p><em>"NASA has selected four Discovery Program investigations to develop concept studies for new missions. Although they’re not official missions yet and some ultimately may not be chosen to move forward, the selections focus on compelling targets and science that are not covered by NASA’s active missions or recent selections. Final selections will be made next year. NASA’s Discovery Program invites scientists and engineers to assemble a team to design exciting planetary science missions that deepen what we know about the solar system and our place in it. These missions will provide frequent flight opportunities for focused planetary science investigations. The goal of the program is to address pressing questions in planetary science and increase our understanding of our solar system."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-four-possible-missions-to-study-the-secrets-of-the-solar-system">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The fingernail-size Intel chip with Foveros technology is a first-of-its kind. With Foveros, processors are built in a totally new way: not with the various IPs spread out flat in two dimensions, but with them stacked in three dimensions. Think of a chip designed as a layer cake (a 1-millimeter-thick layer cake) versus a chip with a more-traditional pancake-like design.

<p><em>"Flexible sensors and an artificial intelligence model tell deformable robots how their bodies are positioned in a 3D environment. For the first time, MIT researchers have enabled a soft robotic arm to understand its configuration in 3D space, by leveraging only motion and position data from its own “sensorized” skin. Soft robots constructed from highly compliant materials, similar to those found in living organisms, are being championed as safer, and more adaptable, resilient, and bioinspired alternatives to traditional rigid robots. But giving autonomous control to these deformable robots is a monumental task because they can move in a virtually infinite number of directions at any given moment. That makes it difficult to train planning and control models that drive automation. Traditional methods to achieve autonomous control use large systems of multiple motion-capture cameras that provide the robots feedback about 3D movement and positions."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2020/sensorized-skin-soft-robots-0213">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In a breakthrough for quantum computing, researchers at UNSW Sydney have made improved qubits using concepts from high school chemistry. Quantum engineers from UNSW Sydney have created artificial atoms in silicon chips that offer improved stability for quantum computing. In a paper published today in Nature Communications, UNSW quantum computing researchers describe how they created artificial atoms in a silicon ‘quantum dot’, a tiny space in a quantum circuit where electrons are used as qubits (or quantum bits), the basic units of quantum information. Scientia Professor Andrew Dzurak explains that unlike a real atom, an artificial atom has no nucleus, but it still has shells of electrons whizzing around the centre of the device, rather than around the atom’s nucleus “The idea of creating artificial atoms using electrons is not new, in fact it was first proposed theoretically in the 1930s and then experimentally demonstrated in the 1990s – although not in silicon. We first made a rudimentary version of it in silicon back in 2013,” says Professor Dzurak, who is an ARC Laureate Fellow and is also director of the Australian National Fabrication Facility at UNSW, where the quantum dot device was manufactured. “But what really excites us about our latest research is that artificial atoms with a higher number of electrons turn out to be much more robust qubits than previously thought possible, meaning they can be reliably used for calculations in quantum computers."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/science-tech/artificial-atoms-create-stable-qubits-quantum-computing">[...]</a>

This can explain why and under which conditions heat propagation becomes fluid-like rather than diffusive. Their equations will make it easier to design next-generation electronic devices at the nanoscale, in which these phenomena can become prevalent. Fourier’s well-known heat equation describes how temperatures change over space and time when heat flows in a solid material. The formulation was developed in 1822 by Joseph Fourier, a French mathematician and physicist hired by Napoleon to increase a cannon’s rate of fire, which was limited by overheating.

<p><em>"Physicists from Switzerland and Germany have unveiled fingerprints of the long-sought particle known as Mahan exciton in the room temperature optical response of the popular methylammonium lead halide perovskites. The optical properties of semiconductors are governed by the so-called “excitons”, which are bound pairs of negative electrons and positive holes. Excitons are important because they transport energy (with no net charge) across materials and thus they play a crucial role in a number of optoelectronic devices. The ability to control the excitonic properties of semiconductors (by tuning parameters such as temperature, pressure, charge density, electric and magnetic fields) is key to broadening the range and diversity of applications. In particular, when the density of charge carriers (electrons and holes) increases, excitons tend to melt and a semiconductor eventually turns into a metal at the so-called Mott density. However, back in 1967, Gerald Mahan predicted that a different type of exciton can still persist above the Mott density."</em> <a href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/new-quasiparticle-unveiled-in-room-temperature-sem/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A new imaging method which exploits the unique properties of quantum-entangled photons to reveal hidden information could help move forward the developing field of quantum radar. Physicists from the University of Glasgow’s Optics Group describe in a paper published today in Science Advances how they used a technique known as quantum illumination to image through noise. Light is comprised of photons and the method in which an image is captured classically is to use all of the photons detected on the camera to form an image. When enough background noise is added to the image, either through natural phenomena or by a deliberate attempt to obscure the image from an observer, it can become impossible to separate the ‘true’ image from the noise. Using quantum illumination the quantum correlations between entangled photons may be used to allow an observer to preferentially filter out false information and noise from an image, allowing the ‘true’ image to be revealed. One potential application for the process is quantum radar, which would use quantum light to make it impossible for objects to be obscured from radar detection by spoofing a signal – a valuable advance for both military and civilian operations."</em> <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/news/headline_709885_en.html">[...]</a>

I have seen micro servos used in all sorts of robots and bionic arms, so I thought it would be a nice idea to try and actuate a 7 segment display using servos. The Arduino Uno, which I usually use for Arduino projects, only has 6 PWM outputs, so I had to get the Arduino Mega. The Mega has 15 PWM outputs, so it was perfect to duplicate some parts of the code and make a two digit display which could count down from 99 (or up to 99).

A lux meter will be used in photography to estimate how bright the flash is and also the encircling ambient lighting. working principle of lux meter :Most of the lux meter consists of a body, photocell or light sensor, and display. The light that falls on to the photocell or sensor contains energy that is transformed into electric current. Indeed, the measure of current depends on the light that strokes the photocell or light sensor. Lux meters read the electrical current calculate the appropriate value, and show this value on its display."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Mini-Digital-LUX-Meter/">[...]</a>

Bluetooth HID (Human Interface Device) is the protocol used by regular Bluetooth keyboard and mice and its possible to emulate this with just an ESP32, which is great! With some ESP32 development boards starting at less than $5* delivered, this is a really inexpensive and simple way to create wireless custom keyboards such as a Macro keypads. Macro keypads can be used for controlling various application like Video editors or Photoshop, personally I use mine for controlling scenes in OBS when I am making videos or streaming. We’ll first look at how to use the ESP32 HID keyboard library and then I will show you how I used this to build a battery powered Bluetooth Macro Keypad.

This latest iteration has the following features: The electronics are really simple now: One ESP8266 module (Wemos D1 Mini) WS2812B LED Strip with 60 LEDs - you can use different densities, and those would impact the overall size of the clock Open Source - source code available on GitHub and can be modified as required Over-the-air updates Has a web interface to change colors, time zones (if wanted) and other settings Has a night mode - to either dim the lights or switch them off completely Uses WiFi to get your time zone and time - so your clock is always synced and shows the correct time Easy to set up the wifi Uses off-the-shelf photo frames to get a great finish The inner portion can be made using 3D printing, laser cutting, or at a stretch even using a simple saw - since this portion is hidden, it doesn't need to be very finished"</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Easy-Infinity-Mirror-Clock/">[...]</a>
