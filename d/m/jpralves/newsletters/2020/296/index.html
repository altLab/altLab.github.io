<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1952, o matemático neozelandês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaughan_Jones">Vaughan Jones</a>. Ele recebeu a Medalha Fields em 1990 pelo seu estudo de análise funcional e teoria dos nós. Em 1984, Jones descobriu uma relação entre as álgebras de von Neumann e a topologia geométrica. Como resultado, ele encontrou um novo invariante polinomial para nós e ligações no espaço 3d. Foi uma surpresa completa porque o seu invariante foi completamente ignorado pelos topologistas, apesar da intensa actividade em áreas estreitamente relacionadas durante os 60 anos anteriores.</p>

<p><em>"SpaceX will try a significantly different approach to landing its future reusable rocket boosters, according to CEO and founder Elon Musk. It will attempt to ‘catch’ the heavy booster, which is currently in development, using the launch tower arm used to stabilize the vehicle during its pre-takeoff preparations. Current Falcon 9 boosters return to Earth and land propulsively on their own built-in legs – but the goal with Super Heavy is for the larger rocket not to have legs at all, says Musk. The Super Heavy launch process will still involve use of its engines to control the velocity of its descent, but it will involve using the grid fins that are included on its main body to help control its orientation during flight to ‘catch’ the booster – essentially hooking it using the launch tower arm before it touches the ground at all. The main benefits of this method, which will obviously involve a lot of precision maneuvering, is that it means SpaceX can save both cost and weight by omitting landing legs from the Super Heavy design altogether. Another potential benefit raised by Musk is that it could allow SpaceX to essentially recycle the Super Heavy booster immediately back on the launch mount it returns to – possibly enabling it to be ready to fly again with a new payload and upper stage (consisting of Starship, the other spacecraft SpaceX is currently developing and testing) in “under an hour.” The goal for Starship and Super Heavy is to create a launch vehicle that’s even more reusable than SpaceX’s current Falcon 9 (and Falcon Heavy) system."</em> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/elon-musk-says-spacex-will-attempt-to-recover-super-heavy-rocket-by-catching-it-with-launch-tower/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The findings may help researchers design “spintronic” devices and novel magnetic materials. A new study illuminates surprising choreography among spinning atoms. In a paper appearing today in the journal Nature, researchers from MIT and Harvard University reveal how magnetic forces at the quantum, atomic scale affect how atoms orient their spins. In experiments with ultracold lithium atoms, the researchers observed different ways in which the spins of the atoms evolve. Like tippy ballerinas pirouetting back to upright positions, the spinning atoms return to an equilibrium orientation in a way that depends on the magnetic forces between individual atoms. For example, the atoms can spin into equilibrium in an extremely fast, “ballistic” fashion or in a slower, more diffuse pattern."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/ultracold-quantum-magnetic-atom-spins-1216">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Physicists use antiferromagnetic rust to carry information over long distances at room temperature Be it with smartphones, laptops, or mainframes: The transmission, processing, and storage of information is currently based on a single class of material – as it was in the early days of computer science about 60 years ago. A new class of magnetic materials, however, could raise information technology to a new level. Antiferromagnetic insulators enable computing speeds that are a thousand times faster than conventional electronics, with significantly less heating. Components could be packed closer together and logic modules could thus become smaller, which has so far been limited due to the increased heating of current components. Information transfer at room temperature So far, the problem has been that the information transfer in antiferromagnetic insulators only worked at low temperatures. But who wants to put their smartphones in the freezer to be able to use it?"</em> <a href="https://www.uni-mainz.de/presse/aktuell/12744_ENG_HTML.php">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The Korean artificial sun sets the new world operating record of 20 seconds at 100 million degrees, twice as long as South Korean researchers set last year A team of South Korean physicists have established a new world record with his « artificial sun« by turning it on and keeping it stable for 20 seconds. It is a device for nuclear fusion known as KSTAR (Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research). From hydrogen, the scientists obtained a plasma (the fourth state of matter) composed of hot ions that exceeded the 100 million degrees temperature centigrade. For comparison, the core of the Sun reaches about 15 million degrees Celsius in temperature. The event occurred on November 24, when the Research Center KSTAR of the Korean Institute of Fusion Energy (KFE) announced that a joint investigation with Seoul National University (SNU) and Columbia University of the United States achieved the milestone. The research effort has been called the Plasma Campaign KSTAR 2020 and has surpassed last year’s eight-second plasma operation."</em> <a href="https://www.explica.co/south-korea-manages-to-light-an-artificial-sun-of-more-than-100-million-degrees-for-20-seconds/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A viable quantum internet — a network in which information stored in qubits is shared over long distances through entanglement — would transform the fields of data storage, precision sensing and computing, ushering in a new era of communication. This month, scientists at Fermilab, a U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science national laboratory, and their partners took a significant step in the direction of realizing a quantum internet. In a paper published in PRX Quantum, the team presents for the first time a demonstration of a sustained, long-distance (44 kilometers of fiber) teleportation of qubits of photons (quanta of light) with fidelity greater than 90%. The qubits were teleported over a fiber-optic network using state-of-the-art single-photon detectors and off-the-shelf equipment. “We’re thrilled by these results,” said Fermilab scientist Panagiotis Spentzouris, head of the Fermilab quantum science program and one of the paper’s co-authors. “This is a key achievement on the way to building a technology that will redefine how we conduct global communication.” Quantum teleportation is a “disembodied” transfer of quantum states from one location to another."</em> <a href="https://news.fnal.gov/2020/12/fermilab-and-partners-achieve-sustained-high-fidelity-quantum-teleportation/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/flexiblebatteries">A flexible screen-printed rechargeable battery with up to 10 times more power than state of the art</a></h2>

<p><em>"A team of researchers has developed a flexible, rechargeable silver oxide-zinc battery with a five to 10 times greater areal energy density than state of the art. The battery also is easier to manufacture; while most flexible batteries need to be manufactured in sterile conditions, under vacuum, this one can be screen printed in normal lab conditions. The device can be used in flexible, stretchable electronics for wearables as well as soft robotics. The team, made up of researchers at the University of California San Diego and California-based company ZPower, details their findings in the Dec. 7 issue of the journal Joule. "Our batteries can be designed around electronics, instead of electronics needed to be designed around batteries," said Lu Yin, one of the paper’s co-first authors and a Ph.D. student in the research group of UC San Diego’s nanoengineering Professor Joseph Wang. The areal capacity for this innovative battery is 50 milliamps per square centimeter at room temperature—this is 10-20 times greater than the areal capacity of a typical Lithium ion battery."</em> <a href="https://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/flexiblebatteries">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The perfect transmission of sound through a barrier is difficult to achieve, if not impossible based on our existing knowledge. This is also true with other energy forms such as light and heat. A research team led by Professor Xiang Zhang, President of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) when he was a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, (UC Berkeley) has for the first time experimentally proved a century old quantum theory that relativistic particles can pass through a barrier with 100% transmission. The research findings have been published in the top academic journal Science. Just as it would be difficult for us to jump over a thick high wall without enough energy accumulated. In contrast, it is predicted that a microscopic particle in the quantum world can pass through a barrier well beyond its energy regardless of the height or width of the barrier, as if it is “transparent”."</em> <a href="https://www.hku.hk/press/news_detail_22183.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-12/ynu-eee122820.php">Extremely energy efficient microprocessor developed using superconductors</a></h2>

<p><em>"Researchers from Yokohama National University in Japan have developed a prototype microprocessor using superconductor devices that are about 80 times more energy efficient than the state-of-the-art semiconductor devices found in the microprocessors of today's high-performance computing systems. As today's technologies become more and more integrated in our daily lives, the need for more computational power is ever increasing. Because of this increase, the energy use of that increasing computational power is growing immensely. For example, so much energy is used by modern day data centers that some are built near rivers so that the flowing water can be used to cool the machinery. "The digital communications infrastructure that supports the Information Age that we live in today currently uses approximately 10% of the global electricity. Studies suggest that in the worst case scenario, if there is no fundamental change in the underlying technology of our communications infrastructure such as the computing hardware in large data centers or the electronics that drive the communication networks, we may see its electricity usage rise to over 50% of the global electricity by 2030," says Christopher Ayala, an associate professor at Yokohama National University, and lead author of the study."</em> <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-12/ynu-eee122820.php">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In 1969, high-density MOS integrated circuits were still new and logic circuits were constructed in a variety of ways. One technique was "four-phase logic", which provided ten times the speed and density of standard logic gates while using 1/10 the power.1 One notable application of four-phase logic was calculators. In 1969, Sharp introduced the first calculator built from high-density MOS chips, the QT-8D, followed by the world's smallest calculator, the handheld EL-8. These calculators were high-end products, selling for $345 (about $1800 today). Integrated circuits at the time weren't dense enough to implement an entire calculator on one chip so these calculators split the functionality across five ICs. These five chips were created for Sharp by the Autonetics division of Rockwell."</em> <a href="http://www.righto.com/2020/12/reverse-engineering-early-calculator.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Because the 8-pin ATtinys only have a few GPIO pins available, they are usually operated without an external clock. The internal oscillator does a good job in most applications, but when it comes to precise timing, its +/-10% accuracy is often insufficient. Fortunately, the oscillator can be calibrated, increasing its accuracy to +/-2% or better. There are a few ways to perform this manual calibration, but several steps are required. The TinyCalibrator does this fully automatically by a push of a button. In order to make the device more versatile, a high voltage fuse resetter was also integrated, with which "bricked" ATtinys can be reset to the factory state."</em> <a href="https://github.com/wagiminator/ATtiny84-TinyCalibrator">[...]</a>

Project Background Most transmissions of coronavirus occur indoors, the majority of those cases are caused by the inhalation of particles containing the virus. The best way to prevent the spread of the virus into the home or workplace is to keep infected people out. However, about 40% of cases are asymptomatic, and these asymptomatic infected people can still spread the virus to others, which is difficult to avoid. Shelly L. Miller, a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder, recently published an article on the Popular Science website, which is about the best way to reduce the risk of indoor infections; Getting fresh air Monitoring carbon dioxide concentrations, and using air purifiers."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/SeeedStudio/indoor-hand-held-co2-detector-for-covid-19-purpose-0c8185">[...]</a>

In this Instructable I will elaborate on this principle which is also called the "Darlington principle". In this circuit, an antenna (spring) is connected to the base of first transistor. When we place this antenna near an object that is AC energized, a small current gets induced into the antenna due to electromagnetic induction. This current triggers the first transistor.

So, we came up with an idea to ease their job, a robotic arm with gripper that picks the lemon from the tree. The arm is about 50cm long. The working principle is simple: we give a position to the robot, then it will go at the right place, and if there is a lemon, its gripper will cut the peduncle and grap the lemon at the same time. Then, the lemon will be released on the ground and the robot will go back to its initial position."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Robotic-Arm-With-Gripper/">[...]</a>
