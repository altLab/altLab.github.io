<p>Faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1863, o inventor e fabricante automovel americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford">Henry Ford</a>. Ele foi o primeiro a experimentar motores de combustão interna enquanto era engenheiro da Edison Illuminating Company. Ele finalizou o primeiro motor a gasolina utilizável a 24 de Dezembro de 1893. O quadriciclo que ele projectou, fez o seu primeiro teste de estrada a 4 de Junho de 1896. Em 16 de Junho de 1903, ele e onze investidores assinaram documentos para criar a Ford Motor Company. A 1 de Outubro de 1908, Ford introduziu o Modelo T confiável e de baixo custo, enquanto continuava a revolucionar a indústria. A Ford introduziu peças fabricadas com precisão projectadas para serem peças padronizadas e trocáveis. Em 1 de Dezembro de 1913, a produção foi aumentada usando uma linha de montagem em movimento contínuo. Em 1918, metade de todos os carros na América eram do modelo T. O último modelo T saiu da linha de montagem em 26 de maio de 1927.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1888, o físico e engenheiro electrotécnico russo-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_K._Zworykin">Vladimir K. Zworykin</a>. Ele ficou conhecido como o "o pai da televisão". Simultaneamente ao início das transmissões de rádio, Zworykin estava a desenvolver um sistema de transmissão de som e imagem. Outros inventores estavam usando um sistema motorizado de varredura mecânica com discos rotativos capazes de fotografar uma polegada quadrada. Era pesado, volumoso e pouco prático para uso doméstico. Zworykin, na Westinghouse, desenvolveu um sistema de televisão digital usando as suas inovações, o iconoscópio e o cinescópio, os precursores da câmara de televisão actual. Ele também inventou o microscópio electrónico.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1940, e empresário e inventor inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clive_Sinclair">Clive Sinclair</a>. Ele fundou a Sinclair Radionics em 1961, onde produziu a primeira calculadora eletrônica de bolso em 1972 (Sinclair Executive). Mais tarde, a Sinclair entrou na produção de computadores domésticos e produziu o Sinclair ZX80, o primeiro computador doméstico de mercado de massas do Reino Unido por menos de £ 100 e, posteriormente, com a Sinclair Research, o ZX81 e o ZX Spectrum; o último é amplamente reconhecido pelos consumidores e programadores pela sua importância nos primeiros dias da indústria britânica de computadores domésticos. Ficou também conhecido por ter criado um veiculo electrico com baterias - o Sinclair C5. Embora tenha sido um fracasso comercial foi dos primeiros veículos eléctricos a serem comercializados para o publico. Tinha autonomia de 32Km, pesava 45Kg e tinha uma velocidade máxima de 24 km/h. Foi lançado em 1985 e apenas foram produzidas 14.000 unidades.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou a NASA lançou a missão Marte 2020 - Perseverance Rover. A missão transportará o veiculo Perseverance até Marte, e aterrará o mesmo na cratera Jezero daqui a cerca de sete meses a 18 de Fevereiro de 2021. O veiculo tem acoplado o helicóptero Ingenuity com o qual tentarão fazer uma serie de experiências relacionadas com o voo de veículos noutros planetas. Aparentemente pouco tempo após a descolagem do foguetão ULA Atlas V's Centaur foi recebido um sinal de telemetria nas estações terrestres com dados a indicar que a nave espacial tinha entrado num estado conhecido como modo de segurança. Muito provavelmente isto sucedeu porque ao entrar na sombra da Terra a temperatura encontrava-se abaixo do esperado. Tendo todos os parâmetros voltado ao normal a equipa da missão está a fazer um diagnostico completo ao foguetão para que possa coloca-lo novamente no seu modo normal.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos assim como projetos de maker. É apresentada a revista MagPI Nº 93 de Agosto assim como a revista newelectronics de 8 de Julho. São apresentados os livros How to Code in Python 3 e Python Machine Learning Projects.</p>

<p><em>"The agency's Mars 2020 mission is on its way. It will land at Jezero Crater in about seven months, on Feb. 18, 2021. NASA's Mars 2020 Perseverance rover mission is on its way to the Red Planet to search for signs of ancient life and collect samples to send back to Earth. Humanity's most sophisticated rover launched with the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter at 7:50 a.m. EDT (4:50 a.m. PDT) Friday on a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket from Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. "With the launch of Perseverance, we begin another historic mission of exploration," said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. "This amazing explorer's journey has already required the very best from all of us to get it to launch through these challenging times."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7718">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Today, 98% of international internet traffic is ferried around the world by subsea cables. A vast underwater network of cables crisscrossing the ocean makes it possible to share, search, send, and receive information around the world at the speed of light. In today’s day and age, as the ways that we work, play and connect are becoming increasingly digital, reliable connectivity is more important than ever before. That’s why we’re excited to announce a new subsea cable—Grace Hopper—which will run between the United States, the United Kingdom and Spain, providing better resilience for the network that underpins Google’s consumer and enterprise products. Grace Hopper joins our other private subsea cables, Curie, Dunant and Equiano to connect far-flung continents along the ocean floor. Private subsea cables allow us to plan effectively for the future capacity needs of our customers and users around the world, and add a layer of security beyond what’s available over the public internet."</em> <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure/announcing-googles-grace-hopper-subsea-cable-system">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://news.microsoft.com/innovation-stories/hydrogen-datacenters/">Microsoft tests hydrogen fuel cells for backup power at datacenters</a></h2>

<p><em>"In a worldwide first that could jumpstart a long-forecast clean energy economy built around the most abundant element in the universe, hydrogen fuel cells have powered a row of datacenter servers for 48 consecutive hours, Microsoft announced Monday. The feat is the latest milestone in the company’s commitment to be carbon negative by 2030. To help achieve that goal and accelerate the global transition away from fossil fuels, Microsoft is also aiming to eliminate its dependency on diesel fuel by 2030. Diesel fuel accounts for less than 1% of Microsoft’s overall emissions. Its use is primarily confined to Azure datacenters, where, like at most cloud providers around the world, diesel-powered generators support continuous operations in the event of power outages and other service disruptions. “They are expensive."</em> <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/innovation-stories/hydrogen-datacenters/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Airbus-France will build the huge satellite that brings the first Martian rock samples back to Earth. This material will be drilled on the Red Planet by the US space agency's next rover, Perseverance, before being blasted into orbit by a rocket. It'll be the Airbus satellite's job to grab the packaged samples and then ship them home. The joint American-European project is expected to cost billions and take just over a decade to implement. But scientists say it's probably the best way to confirm whether life has ever existed on the Red Planet. Any evidence is likely to be controversial and will need the powerful analytical tools only found in Earth laboratories to convince the doubters, the researchers argue."</em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-53575353">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: SPCE) (“Virgin Galactic” or “the Company”), a vertically integrated aerospace and space travel company, today revealed the cabin interior of its first SpaceshipTwo vehicle, VSS Unity in a virtual event streamed live on YouTube. Aspiring astronauts and space enthusiasts around the world, now have the opportunity to explore the Virgin Galactic cabin design and spaceflight experience through an augmented reality enabled mobile app, which launches after the live event, and is available to download for free at both the App Store and Play Store. One of the defining hallmarks of the Virgin brand over 50 years, has been the use of inspired and bold design to transform the customer experience. It’s an ethos that has been successfully applied across industrial sectors and design disciplines: from aircraft cabins and hotel bedrooms to fitness classes and personal banking. Virgin Galactic, in collaboration with London design agency, Seymourpowell, has striven to remain faithful to that tradition by developing an elegant but progressive, experience-focused concept for the cabin of its spaceship. While it has been created to integrate seamlessly with every other aspect of the Virgin Galactic astronaut journey – the cabin is also the design centrepiece; providing safety without distraction, quietly absorbing periods of sensory intensity and offering each astronaut a level of intimacy required for personal discovery and transformation."</em> <a href="https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-reveals-spaceshiptwo-cabin-interior/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers devise an on-off system that allows high-fidelity operations and interconnection between processors. MIT researchers have introduced a quantum computing architecture thatcan perform low-error quantum computations while also rapidly sharing quantum information between processors. The work represents a key advance toward a complete quantum computing platform. Previous to this discovery, small-scale quantum processors have successfully performed tasks at a rate exponentially faster than that of classical computers. However, it has been difficult to controllably communicate quantum information between distant parts of a processor. In classical computers, wired interconnects are used to route information back and forth throughout a processor during the course of a computation."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/giant-atoms-quantum-processing-communication-0729">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A team of researchers led by Cunjiang Yu, Bill D. Cook Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Houston, has developed a new form of electronics known as “drawn-on-skin electronics,” allowing multifunctional sensors and circuits to be drawn on the skin with an ink pen. The advance, the researchers report in Nature Communications, allows for the collection of more precise, motion artifact-free health data, solving the long-standing problem of collecting precise biological data through a wearable device when the subject is in motion. The imprecision may not be important when your FitBit registers 4,000 steps instead of 4,200, but sensors designed to check heart function, temperature and other physical signals must be accurate if they are to be used for diagnostics and treatment. The drawn-on-skin electronics are able to seamlessly collect data, regardless of the wearer’s movements. They also offer other advantages, including simple fabrication techniques that don’t require dedicated equipment. “It is applied like you would use a pen to write on a piece of paper,” said Yu."</em> <a href="https://www.uh.edu/news-events/stories/july-2020/07302020yu-liquid-electronics.php">[...]</a>

<p><em>"University of Michigan engineers create centimeter-sized robots capable of more than ever before Origami principles can unlock the potential of the smallest robots, enhancing speed, agility and control in machines no more than a centimeter in size. University of Michigan researchers have demonstrated that behavioral rules underpinning the Japanese art of folding can expand the capabilities of these machines, creating potential for greater use in fields as diverse as medical equipment and infrastructure sensing. “We’ve come up with a new way to design, fabricate and actuate microbots,” said Evgueni Filipov, U-M assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering. “We’ve been the first to bring advanced origami folding capabilities into one integrated microbot system.” Their bots can form one shape, complete a task, then reconfigure into a second shape for an additional task, and so on. The latest research from the team, which includes Kenn Oldham, a U-M professor of mechanical engineering, Ph.D. student Yi Zhu and graduate research assistant Mayur Birla, appears in Advanced Functional Materials.

<h2><a href="https://hub.jhu.edu/2020/07/30/astrophysicsists-observe-gravitational-redshift-effect/">Johns Hopkins astrophysicists observe long-theorized quantum phenomena</a></h2>

<p><em>"A team led by students probes the mass-radius relation of white dwarf stars, observing in their data evidence of quantum mechanics and Einstein's theory of general relativity At the heart of every white dwarf star—the dense stellar object that remains after a star has burned away its fuel reserve of gases as it nears the end of its life cycle—lies a quantum conundrum: as white dwarfs add mass, they shrink in size, until they become so small and tightly compacted that they cannot sustain themselves, collapsing into a neutron star. This puzzling relationship between a white dwarf's mass and size, called the mass-radius relation, was first theorized by Nobel Prize-winning astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar in the 1930s. Now, a team of Johns Hopkins astrophysicists has developed a method to observe the phenomenon itself using astronomical data collected by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and a recent dataset released by the Gaia Space Observatory.

<p><em>"Scientists have found that a physical property called ‘quantum negativity’ can be used to take more precise measurements of everything from molecular distances to gravitational waves. The researchers, from the University of Cambridge, Harvard and MIT, have shown that quantum particles can carry an unlimited amount of information about things they have interacted with. The results, reported in the journal Nature Communications, could enable far more precise measurements and power new technologies, such as super-precise microscopes and quantum computers. Metrology is the science of estimations and measurements. If you weighed yourself this morning, you’ve done metrology.

Surprisingly, when all qubits return to the “present,” they appear largely unaltered, as if reality is self-healing. “On a quantum computer, there is no problem simulating opposite-in-time evolution, or simulating running a process backwards into the past,” said Nikolai Sinitsyn, a theoretical physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory and coauthor of the paper with Bin Yan, a post doc in the Center for Nonlinear Studies, also at Los Alamos. “So we can actually see what happens with a complex quantum world if we travel back in time, add small damage, and return.

Pass is co-author of “On One-Way Functions and Kolmogorov Complexity,” which will be presented at the IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, to be held Nov. 16-19 in Durham, North Carolina. “The result,” he said, “is that a natural computational problem introduced in the 1960s in the Soviet Union characterizes the feasibility of basic cryptography – private-key encryption, digital signatures and authentication, for example.” For millennia, cryptography was considered a cycle: Someone invented a code, the code was effective until someone eventually broke it, and the code became ineffective."</em> <a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2020/07/randomness-theory-could-hold-key-internet-security">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In a study published in Nature Astronomy, an international team of researchers has presented a new, detailed look inside the “central engine” of a large solar flare accompanied by a powerful eruption first captured on Sept. 10, 2017 by the Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA) — a solar radio telescope facility operated by New Jersey Institute of Technology’s (NJIT) Center for Solar-Terrestrial Research (CSTR). The new findings, based on EOVSA’s observations of the event at microwave wavelengths, offer the first measurements characterizing the magnetic fields and particles at the heart of the explosion. The results have revealed an enormous electric current “sheet” stretching more than 40,000 kilometers through the core flaring region where opposing magnetic field lines approach each other, break and reconnect, generating the intense energy powering the flare. Notably, the team’s measurements also indicate a magnetic bottle-like structure located at the top of the flare’s loop-shaped base (known as the flare arcade) at a height of nearly 20,000 kilometers above the Sun’s surface. The structure, the team suggests, is likely the primary site where the flare’s highly energetic electrons are trapped and accelerated to nearly the speed of light. Researchers say the study’s new insight into the central engine that drives such powerful eruptions may aid future space weather predictions for potentially catastrophic energy releases from solar flares — the solar system’s most powerful explosions, capable of severely disrupting technologies on Earth such as satellite operations, GPS navigation and communication systems, among many others."</em> <a href="https://news.njit.edu/researchers-offer-unprecedented-look-central-engine-powering-solar-flare">[...]</a>

Described in a research paper published today in Nature’s Communications Materials, the new technique does not require the typical metal catalysts or special raw materials to turn carbon into crystalline graphite. Interestingly it was instead discovered by a research student in a lab, using an Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (AAS) – a piece of equipment, invented in Australia in the 1950s and developed to analyse the composition of liquids. The Master-level student behind the discovery, Mr Jason Fogg, said that while the exact science behind why this new technique works is still to be confirmed, he believes it relates to the specific way the AAS heats the samples through short fast pulses. “We used a special furnace that can heat the sample to 3000 degrees Celsius in seconds, something most furnaces cannot achieve,” Mr Fogg said. “To put the temperature into perspective, 3000 degrees Celsius is equal to about half the surface temperature of the Sun.” Dr Irene Suarez-Martinez, from Curtin’s School of Electrical Engineering, Computing and Mathematical Sciences, said that while graphite is the most stable form of carbon, most carbon materials stubbornly refuse to turn into graphite, which is why she was absolutely shocked to learn about Mr Fogg’s results."</em> <a href="https://news.curtin.edu.au/media-releases/serendipity-broadens-the-scope-for-making-graphite/">[...]</a>

This time instead of sending voice from one can to the other, data will be sent using a short beep for 0 and a long beep for 1 with a longer start beep to begin the transmission. A transmitter circuit on one end takes data from UART cable to a PC and relays the data through a speaker in one can. The receiver circuit has a microphone in the can and UART cable to relay the response back to the PC. This project was quite a bit more difficult than it looks.

The first idea was to use an ESP8266 and to make use of the WIFI capabilities (e.g. displaying lap times and speed on a website and having the possibliltity to make firmeware updates “over the air”). But after a second thought I came to the conclusion that it would also mean more complexitity and that the possiblity of OTA firmware updates would open the door to an never-ending project."</em> <a href="https://blog.tldnr.org/2020/05/08/slot-car-lap-counter/">[...]</a>
