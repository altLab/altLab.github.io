<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1616, o matemático inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wallis">John Wallis</a>. Ele foi responsável pela introdução do símbolo de infinito na matemática. Wallis era habilidoso em criptografia e descodificava mensagens monárquicos para os parlamentares durante a Guerra Civil. Posteriormente, ele foi nomeado para a Cadeira de Geometria Salvador em Oxford em 1649, uma posição que ocupou até sua morte mais de 50 anos depois. Wallis fazia parte de um grupo interessado em ciência natural e experimental que se tornou a Royal Society, então Wallis é um membro fundador da Royal Society e um de seus primeiros Fellows. Wallis contribuiu substancialmente para as origens do cálculo e foi o matemático inglês mais influente antes de Newton.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1753, o inventor britânico <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Crompton">Samuel Crompton</a>. Ele, durante a Revolução Industrial, criou a "mula giratória". O fio contínuo, forte e fino que foi capaz de girar foi um benefício para os fabricantes de tecido de algodão. Era chamado de "mula" porque era um híbrido das ideias de Richard Arkwright e James Hargreaves. A fiação tinha chegado à maioridade desde a ocupação doméstica até a produção da fábrica.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1877, o inventor e pioneiro da aviação neozelandês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Pearse">Richard Pearse</a>. Aos 21 anos,  construiu uma oficina com uma forja e um torno para se tornar num inventor. A sua primeira patente foi um tipo de bicicleta. Em 1902, Pearse provavelmente tinha construído um motor leve de dois cilindros e primeiro avião a partir de bambu, aço tubular, arame e tela. Os relatos das datas e detalhes de seus voos variam porque não foram documentados, mas acredita-se que a 31 de Março de 1903 ele fez pelo menos uma descolagem propulsionada, embora não um voo controlado e sustentado, cobrindo talvez 350 metros antes de bater numa cerca alta. (Seria a quinta descolagem bem sucedida no mundo.) Ele fez outras invenções em sua vida.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1886, o fisico sueco <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manne_Siegbahn">Manne Siegbahn</a>. Ele recebeu o Prémio Nobel de Física em 1924 pelas suas descobertas e investigações em espectroscopia de raios-X. Em 1914 ele começou os seus estudos na nova ciência da espectroscopia de raios-X que já tinha estabelecido a partir de espectros de raios-X que existiam duas 'conchas' distintas de electrões dentro dos átomos, cada uma dando origem a grupos de linhas espectrais, rotulados de 'K' e 'L'. Em 1916, Siegbahn descobriu uma terceira série, ou "M". (Mais foram encontrados mais tarde em elementos mais pesados.) Refinando o seu equipamento de raio-X e técnica, ele foi capaz de aumentar significativamente a precisão de suas determinações de linhas espectrais. Isto permitiu que ele fizesse correcções na equação de Bragg para difracção de raios-X para permitir os detalhes mais finos da difracção de cristal.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1924, o cientista da computação norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Backus">John Backus</a>. Ele foi responsável pela invenção da linguagem de programação FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslation) em meados da década de 1950. Ele já tinha desenvolvido uma linguagem assembly para o computador 701 da IBM quando sugeriu o desenvolvimento de um compilador e linguagem de mais alto nível para o IBM 704. Como a primeira linguagem de programação de computador de alto nível, o FORTRAN foi capaz de converter fórmulas e expressões matemáticas padrão no código binário usado pelos computadores. Assim, um não-especialista poderia escrever um programa em palavras e símbolos familiares, e diferentes computadores poderiam usar programas gerados na mesma língua. Isto abriu caminho para outras linguagens de computador, como o COBOL, o ALGOL e o BASIC.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1933, o químico holandês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_J._Crutzen">Paul J. Crutzen</a>. Ele recebeu o Prémio Nobel da Química de 1995 por demonstrar, em 1970, que compostos químicos de óxido de nitrogénio aceleram a destruição do ozono estratosférico, que protege a Terra da radiação ultravioleta do Sol. O seu trabalho, publicado em 1970, mostrou que os óxidos de nitrogénio NO e NO2 reagem de forma catalítica com ozono, acelerando assim a taxa de quebra de ozono para O2 na estratosfera. Estes óxidos de nitrogénio são formados principalmente pela decomposição do óxido nitroso (N2O) que se origina de transformações microbiológicas no solo. Ele dividiu o prémio com os químicos Mario Molina e F.Sherwood Rowland, que descobriram em 1974 que gases fabricados clorofluorcarbonetos (CFC) também contribuíam para o esgotamento do ozono.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1942, o ceramista norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_C._Schultz">Peter C. Schultz</a>. Ele, trabalhando com os investigadores da Corning Glass Robert Maurer e Donald Keck, desenvolveu a fibra óptica, capaz de transportar 65.000 vezes mais informações do que o fio de cobre convencional, uma realidade prática. Em 1970, Maurer, Keck e Schultz projectaram e produziram a primeira fibra óptica com perdas ópticas baixas o suficiente para amplo uso em telecomunicações. A fibra óptica é feita de dióxido de silício (areia pura) e pó de quartzo para fazer uma haste oca. Um gás aquecido é então soprado através da haste oca para deixar um fino depósito de vidro ultra-puro no interior da haste. O tubo é então aquecido e colapsado numa haste sólida com núcleo de vidro ultra-puro. Estas "hastes" de vidro são mais finas que um cabelo e podem dobrar, elas são muito resistentes.</p>

<p>Faz hoje 110 anos que as luzes de Néon desenvolvidas pelo físico francês Georges Claude, fizeram a sua estreia pública no Paris Motor Show. A luz colorida é produzida através da passagem da corrente eléctrica através de gases inertes num tubo de vácuo. Este efeito foi produzido após décadas de experiências para criar uma alternativa prática à iluminação incandescente. A sinalização de néon chegou à América quando Earle C.Anthony comprou dois cartazes por US$ 2.400 em Paris e as instalou na sua concessionária Packard em Los Angeles. O gás néon brilha um vermelho-laranja ardente; árgon é lavanda macia; gás árgon melhorado com mercúrio é azul brilhante. Mais de 150 cores podem ser alcançadas combinando diferentes gases (incluindo crípton, xénon e hélio) e fósforos que revestem o interior do tubo de vidro.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou o Telescópio do Observatório de Arecibo em Porto Rico entra em colapso meses após cabos quebrarem. O enorme e já danificado radiotelescópio Arecibo entrou em colapso completamente depois da sua plataforma receptora de 900 toneladas cair sobre o prato do reflector abaixo. O telescópio desempenhou um papel fundamental em descobertas astronómicas por mais de meio século e entrou na cultura popular com aparições em filmes de Hollywood como GoldenEye e Contact. A Fundação Nacional de Ciência dos EUA (NSF) já tinha anunciado anteriormente que o Observatório de Arecibo seria fechado.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou a sonda Chang'e-5, lançada na passada semana, completa a recolha de amostras da superfície Lunar, onde aterrou com sucesso. As amostras foram embaladas e armazenadas no dispositivo de armazenamento. Posteriormente a sonda já saiu da superfície lunar estando neste momento a caminho da Terra. Passaram mais de 40 anos desde que amostras lunares foram trazidas pela última vez de volta à Terra.</p>

<p><em>"A huge, already damaged Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico has completely collapsed after its 900-ton receiver platform fell onto the reflector dish below. The telescope has played a key role in astronomical discoveries for more than half a century and entered popular culture with appearances in Hollywood films like GoldenEye and Contact. The US National Science Foundation (NSF) had earlier announced that the Arecibo Observatory would be closed. An auxiliary cable snapped in August, causing a wide gash on the 305-metre-wide dish and damaging the receiver platform that hung above it. Then a main cable broke in early November. 'A huge loss' The collapse stunned many scientists who had relied on what had been the largest radio telescope in the world."</em> <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-12-02/arecibo-observatory-telescope-collapses-in-puerto-rico/12941128">[...]</a>

<p><em>"At 22:00 on December 2, after about 19 hours of lunar surface work, the lunar exploration project Chang'e-5 probe successfully completed the automatic sampling of the lunar surface, and the samples were packaged and stored in the storage device carried by the ascender in a predetermined form. During the sampling and packaging process, the scientific and technical personnel simulated the geographic model of the sampling area according to the data returned by the detector in the ground laboratory and simulated sampling throughout the entire process, providing an important basis for sampling decision-making and operations in each link. The lunar soil structure detector and other payloads equipped with the lander are working normally, and scientific surveys are carried out as planned, and sampling information support is provided. Automatic sampling is one of the core key links of the Chang'e-5 mission. The detector withstands the test of lunar surface temperature exceeding 100 degrees Celsius, overcomes the constraints of measurement and control, illumination, and power supply, and relies on a newly developed extraterrestrial celestial body sample collection mechanism , Separately collect lunar samples by mechanical arm surface extraction and drilling tool drilling, realizing multi-point and diversified automatic sampling. Among them, the drilling tool drilled the lunar soil samples under the lunar surface, and the robotic arm carried out various sampling on the lunar surface with the support of the end sampler."</em> <a href="http://www.clep.org.cn/n5982341/c6810710/content.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Prototype flown in hypersonic wind tunnel simulating flight conditions at nine times the speed of sound The ‘sodramjet’ engine could offer the biggest hope so far of commercial flight reaching hypersonic speed, the scientists say Chinese scientists have built what they claim is a revolutionary plane engine for Mach 16 flight. An aircraft powered by the engine could reach anywhere in the world within two hours, they said. The test flight of a prototype in a hypersonic wind tunnel in Beijing suggested unprecedented performance in terms of thrust, fuel efficiency and operational stability. The engine could also serve “reusable trans-atmospheric planes [that will] take off horizontally from an airport runway, accelerate into orbit around the Earth, then re-enter into the atmosphere, and finally land at an airport,” said the scientists, led by Professor Jiang Zonglin of the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Mechanics in a peer-reviewed paper published in the Chinese Journal of Aeronautics on Saturday. The futuristic engine has a relatively simple design. It consists of three major components without any moving parts: a single-stage air inlet, hydrogen fuel injector and combustion chamber."</em> <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3111985/chinese-team-test-jet-engine-able-reach-anywhere-earth-within-2">[...]</a>

<p><em>"At an Intel Labs virtual event today, Intel unveiled Horse Ridge II, its second-generation cryogenic control chip, marking another milestone in the company’s progress toward overcoming scalability, one of quantum computing’s biggest hurdles. Building on innovations in the first-generation Horse Ridge controller introduced in 2019, Horse Ridge II supports enhanced capabilities and higher levels of integration for elegant control of the quantum system. New features include the ability to manipulate and read qubit states and control the potential of several gates required to entangle multiple qubits. “With Horse Ridge II, Intel continues to lead innovation in the field of quantum cryogenic controls, drawing from our deep interdisciplinary expertise bench across the Integrated Circuit design, Labs and Technology Development teams. We believe that increasing the number of qubits without addressing the resulting wiring complexities is akin to owning a sports car, but constantly being stuck in traffic. Horse Ridge II further streamlines quantum circuit controls, and we expect this progress to deliver increased fidelity and decreased power output, bringing us one step closer toward the development of a ‘traffic-free’ integrated quantum circuit.” –Jim Clarke, Intel director of Quantum Hardware, Components Research Group, Intel Today’s early quantum systems use room-temperature electronics with many coaxial cables that are routed to the qubit chip inside a dilution refrigerator."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news/intel-debuts-2nd-gen-horse-ridge-cryogenic-quantum-control-chip/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Customers can prototype with the same FPGA silicon and package that is now headed for space qualification Microchip Technology (Nasdaq: MCHP) today announced it is shipping engineering silicon for its RT PolarFire® Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) while the device is being qualified to spaceflight component reliability standards. Designers can now create hardware prototypes with all the same electrical and mechanical performance that the space-qualified RT PolarFire FPGAs will provide for high-bandwidth on-orbit processing systems with industry-low power consumption and the ability to withstand radiation effects in space. “This is a major milestone as we release RT PolarFire FPGA engineering silicon to our customers and begin the spaceflight qualification process through full QML Class V standards,” said Bruce Weyer, vice president of Microchip’s FPGA business unit. “Many of our customers have already jump-started satellite system payload development using our commercial PolarFire MPF500T FPGAs and now all prototyping can be done with silicon that will be identical in form, fit and function to our eventual flight-qualified RT PolarFire FPGAs.” Microchip is qualifying its RT PolarFire RTPF500T FPGAs to Mil Std 883 Class B, QML Class Q and QML Class V -- the highest qualification and screening standard for monolithic integrated circuits in space. Designed to survive a rocket launch and meet demanding performance needs in space, RT PolarFire FPGAs are ideal for applications including high-resolution passive and active imaging, precision remote scientific measurement, multi-spectral and hyper-spectral imaging, and object detection and recognition using neural networks. These applications require high levels of operating performance and density, low heat dissipation, low power consumption and low system-level costs."</em> <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/about/news-releases/products/microchip-s-low-power-radiation-tolerant--rt--polarfire--fpga-is">[...]</a>

Excitons are excited states of matter found within semiconductors – a key ingredient in many current technologies. They form when electrons in the semiconductor material are excited by light to a higher energy state, leaving behind a “hole” at the energy level where the electron previously resided. “Holes are the absence of an electron, and so carry the opposite charge to an electron,” explained senior author Professor Keshav Dani, who leads the Femtosecond Spectroscopy Unit at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST). “These opposite charges attract, and electrons and holes bind together to form excitons that can then move throughout the material.” In regular semiconductors, excitons are extinguished in less than a few billionths of a second after creation."</em> <a href="https://www.oist.jp/news-center/press-releases/dark-excitons-hit-spotlight">[...]</a>

The results of the study are published in the journal Light: Science and Application. “Having the ability to fabricate optics with different shapes and optical parameters offers a solution to common problems faced in optics,” said Braun, who is a professor of materials science and engineering. “For example, in imaging applications, focusing on a specific object often results in blurry edges."</em> <a href="https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/1565551394">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Additive manufacturing has yet to reach its potential in part because tiny bubbles or pores can form, creating weak spots in finished parts. Research published in Science reveals how the pores form and offers insight into controlling the machines to avoid this problem. Laser powder bed fusion is a dominant additive manufacturing technology that has yet to reach its potential. The problem facing industry is that tiny bubbles or pores sometimes form during the printing process, and these pores create weak spots in finished products. When a slow-speed, high-power laser is melting metal powder during the 3D printing of a part, a keyhole-shaped cavity in the melt pool can result.

<p><em>"Giant planets that developed early in a star system’s life could solve a mystery of why spiral structures are not observed in young protoplanetary discs, according to a new study by University of Warwick astronomers. The research, published today (26 November) in the Astrophysical Journal Letters andpart supported by the Royal Society, provides an explanation for the lack of spiral structure that astronomers expect to see in protoplanetary discs around young stars that also suggests that scientists may have to reassess how quickly planets form in a disc’s lifecycle. Protoplanetary discs are the birthplaces of planets, harbouring the material that will eventually coalesce into the array of planets that we see in the Universe. When these discs are young they form spiral structures, with all their dust and material dragged into dense arms by the massive gravitational effect of the disc spinning. A similar effect occurs at the galactic level, hence why we see spiral galaxies such as our own, the Milky Way. Over the course of three to ten million years material from the disc comes together to form planets, falls onto the star it is orbiting or just disperses into space through winds coming off the disc."</em> <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/rapid-forming_giants_could">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A team in Paris has made the most precise measurement yet of the fine-structure constant, killing hopes for a new force of nature. As fundamental constants go, the speed of light, c, enjoys all the fame, yet c’s numerical value says nothing about nature; it differs depending on whether it’s measured in meters per second or miles per hour. The fine-structure constant, by contrast, has no dimensions or units. It’s a pure number that shapes the universe to an astonishing degree — “a magic number that comes to us with no understanding,” as Richard Feynman described it. Paul Dirac considered the origin of the number “the most fundamental unsolved problem of physics.” Numerically, the fine-structure constant, denoted by the Greek letter α (alpha), comes very close to the ratio 1/137. It commonly appears in formulas governing light and matter."</em> <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-measure-the-magic-fine-structure-constant-20201202/">[...]</a>

This family of 4-bit processors was called the TMS1000.1 A 4-bit processor now seems very limited, but it was a good match for calculators, where each decimal digit fit into four bits. This microcontroller was also used in hand-held games2 and simple control applications such as microwave ovens.3 Since its software was in ROM, the TMS1000 needed to be custom-manufactured for each application, but it was inexpensive and sold for $2-$4 in quantity. It became very popular and was said to be the best-selling "computer on a chip". The die photo above shows the main functional blocks of the TMS1000. One thing that distinguishes the TMS1000 (and most microcontrollers) from regular processors is the "Harvard architecture", where code and data are stored and accessed separately."</em> <a href="http://www.righto.com/2020/11/reverse-engineering-ram-storage-in.html">[...]</a>

One of the largest preoccupations about this new virus is its notable ability to spread given the absence of any effective treatment, vaccine, and immunity in human populations. Epidemiologists quantify the ability of infectious agents to spread by estimating the basic reproduction number (R0) statistic (Delamater et al., 2019), which measures the average number of people each contagious person infects. The new coronavirus is transmitting at an average R0 between 2.7 and 3.2 (Billah, Miah &amp; Khan, 2020; Liu et al., 2020), which is greater than seasonal influenza viruses that spread every year around the planet (median R0 of 1.28, Biggerstaff et al., 2014)."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/kutluhan-aktar/web-enabled-ml-mask-detection-robot-fines-w-penalty-receipt-23821b">[...]</a>

The instrument I designed, although tested for accuracy with a flowmeter is not in any way a certified medical device, but in a pinch it certainly could pass for one--giving relative reproducible and accurate accounts of the standard FEV1, FEVC and graphs of volume output and speed over time. I designed it so that the electronics with the expensive tethered sensor were confined to one piece and the easily disposable blow tube with associated virus laden channels was in another. This appears to be one of the drawbacks of standard machines used clinically -- replaceable cardboard mouthpieces don't really eliminate all risks when viruses are airborne and you're asked to blow long and hard into a very expensive apparatus.

It consists of an 8-pin DIP socket to insert the new ATtiny85 chip, C1 decoupling capacitor, and C2 capacitor is provided to avoid the Arduino UNO from being auto-reset when we upload the program to the ATtiny85 chip. The project is a good choice when the user wants to shrink the Arduino project into an 8-pin microcontroller and when the project requires only a few I/O pins.

<p><em>"Make a wooden smart clock with Zigbee feature to monitor the environment of your home. Initially, I wanted to monitor the environment in another room by means of a Zigbee device collecting temperature and humidity data from a Thunderboard. I needed a screen to display the sensor data, but I didn’t want to use a developer board, so I decided to design a beautiful enclosure and create an exquisite product. After considering a variety of enclosures, I decided to design a fine, clock-like wooden device for a nightstand or desk that would function as a smart alarm clock and display sensor data. The design would look like the figure below.

In the video below, there is the presentation of the boat navigating through the control by the dashboard assembled by Eliezer Neto on the Arduino Cloud IoT, we tested the control by making the boat rotate on its own axis and the navigation forwards and turns to the right. The control of forward navigation was to be desired because one engine was spinning faster than the other, thus compromising the route in a straight line, if your project has the same problem it can be solved by software with a PDI code to compensate for the rotation or hardware with a voltage limiter on the motor pole.

The ideal pH range for most hydroponic systems is between 5.5 and 6.5. pH is important because it affects the availability and absorption of the elements needed for plant growth. Oxygen is an essential plant nutrient and plant root systems require oxygen for aerobic respiration, an essential plant process that releases energy for root growth and nutrient uptake. In aeroponics systems, the oxygen supplied for plant root uptake is provided mostly as dissolved oxygen (DO) in the nutrient solution as well as a zone of aeration provided by a gap from the surface to the reservoir water level. The effect of temperature of the solution on the DO levels and on root respiration rates also needs to be taken into account. As the temperature of your nutrient solution increases, the ability of that solution to hold DO decreases."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/chuygen/professional-hydroponics-ph-and-do-monitoring-fc63df">[...]</a>
