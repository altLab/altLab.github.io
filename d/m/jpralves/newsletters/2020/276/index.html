<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1625, o matemático e físico dinamarquês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasmus_Bartholin">Rasmus Bartholin</a>. Ele descobriu o fenómeno óptico da refracção dupla. Em 1669, Bartholin observou que as imagens vistas através do feldspato islandês (calcita) eram duplicadas e que, quando o cristal era girado, uma imagem permanecia estacionária enquanto a outra girava com o cristal. Tal comportamento da luz não poderia ser explicado usando as teorias ópticas de Isaac Newton da época. Posteriormente, isto foi explicado como o efeito da polarização da luz. Bartholin escreveu um grande número de trabalhos matemáticos e fez observações astronómicas, incluindo os cometas de 1665. Ele também é famoso pelo seu trabalho médico, em particular a introdução do quinino na luta contra a malária.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1814, o físico sueco <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Jonas_%C3%85ngstr%C3%B6m">Anders Ångström</a>. Ele foi pioneiro no uso da espectroscopia e é reconhecido no nome do angstrom, uma unidade de comprimento igual a 10^-10 metros. Em 1853, ele estudou o espectro de hidrogénio para o qual Balmer derivou uma fórmula. Ele anunciou em 1862 que a análise do espectro solar mostrava que o hidrogénio está presente na atmosfera solar. Em 1867 ele foi o primeiro a examinar o espectro da aurora boreal. Ele publicou a sua extensa pesquisa sobre o espectro solar em Recherches sur le specter solaire (1868), com medições detalhadas de mais de 1000 linhas espectrais. Ele também publicou trabalhos sobre teoria térmica e realizou medições geo-magnéticas em diferentes lugares da Suécia.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1819, o físico teórico britânico <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_George_Stokes,_1st_Baronet">George Stokes</a>. Ele estudou fluidos viscosos e formulou a sua lei da viscosidade para a velocidade de uma esfera sólida a cair num fluido. Outras leis e trabalhos matemáticos pelos quais é conhecido incluem o teorema de Stokes, no campo da análise vectorial. Stokes também trabalhou em óptica, a teoria das ondas da luz, difracção (1849), o espectro ultravioleta e outras análises de espectro. Ele cunhou a palavra fluorescência (1852) enquanto estudava esse fenómeno e foi um dos fundadores do campo da geodésia com seu estudo das variações da gravidade (1849).</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1875, o astrónomo alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Louis_d%27Arrest">Heinrich Louis d'Arrest</a>. Ele foi responsável por acelerar a descoberto do planeta Neptuno ao sugerir a comparação do céu, na região indicada pelos cálculos de Urbain Le Verrier, com um mapa estelar preparado recentemente. O planeta foi encontrado na mesma noite. O seu sogro foi A. F. Moebius (1790 - 1868). d'Arrest encontrou vários cometas, o de 1851 com um período de 6,6 anos tem o seu nome. Um trabalho que ele publicou foi sobre os asteróides entre Marte e Júpiter, outro trabalho intitulado Siderum nebulosorum Noticees Hafniensis continha 1942 nebulosas, das quais 340 descritas pela primeira vez.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1888, o engenheiro escocês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Logie_Baird">John Logie Baird</a>. Ele foi o primeiro homem a televisionar imagens de contorno de objectos (1924), seguido no ano seguinte por rostos humanos reconhecíveis. Em 1926, ele foi capaz de demonstrar a TV para objectos em movimento no Royal Institution de Londres, e a TV em cores em 1928. Em 1936, a BBC iniciou o primeiro serviço regular de alta definição do Alexandra Palace usando o sistema Baird, embora fosse abandonado um ano depois em favor de um sistema desenvolvido pela Marconi-EMI. Em 1939, 20.000 aparelhos de televisão estavam a ser usados na Grã-Bretanha. Em 1940, Baird fez uma demonstração de uma televisão estéreo colorida de alta definição. Baird continuou experimentando e foi relatado que completou as suas pesquisas na televisão estereoscópica em 1946.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1902, o engenheiro alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Wankel">Felix Wankel</a>. Ele inventou o primeiro motor rotativo de combustão interna. Em 1924, ele abriu a sua própria oficina e teve a ideia de um motor rotativo. Em 1927, ele tinha desenhado a forma do seu motor de pistão rotativo. Embora ele tenha recebido sua primeira patente em 1929 (DRP 507.584), foi em Fevereiro de 1957 que o primeiro motor rotativo Wankel verdadeiramente funcional estava pronto. Em vez de pistões em movimento, o motor Wankel usa um rotor orbital em forma de triângulo equilátero curvo. Assim, necessita de poucas peças móveis, é leve e compacto.</p>

<p>E nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que em 4 de Julho, o Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) da NASA concluiu sua missão principal, visualizando cerca de 75% do céu estrelado como parte de uma pesquisa de dois anos. Ao capturar este mosaico gigante, o TESS encontrou 66 novos exo-planetas, ou mundos além do nosso sistema solar, bem como cerca de 2.100 candidatos que os astrónomos estão a trabalhar para confirmar. “A TESS está a produzir uma torrente de observações de alta qualidade, fornecendo dados valiosos numa ampla gama de tópicos científicos”, disse Patricia Boyd, cientista do projecto da TESS no Goddard Space Flight Center da NASA em Greenbelt, Maryland. “Ao entrar em sua missão estendida, TESS já é um sucesso estrondoso.”</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou, um dos maiores radio telescópios do mundo, localizado em Arecibo em Porto Rico sofreu danos que o deixaram inoperacional. Um dos cabos auxiliares que ajuda a sustentar uma plataforma de metal colocada acima do Observatório, partiu-se na segunda-feira (10 de Agosto), causando um corte de 30 metros de comprimento no prato reflector do telescópio. As instalações da National Science Foundation estão fechadas enquanto os engenheiros avaliam os danos e estimam a extensão das reparações que serão necessárias para colocar o telescópio novamente em operação.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos assim como projetos de maker. É apresentado um modelo 3D para imprimir assim como a revista newelectronics de 11 de Agosto.</p>

<p><em>"On July 4, NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) finished its primary mission, imaging about 75% of the starry sky as part of a two-year-long survey. In capturing this giant mosaic, TESS has found 66 new exoplanets, or worlds beyond our solar system, as well as nearly 2,100 candidates astronomers are working to confirm. “TESS is producing a torrent of high-quality observations providing valuable data across a wide range of science topics,” said Patricia Boyd, the project scientist for TESS at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. “As it enters its extended mission, TESS is already a roaring success.” TESS monitors 24-by-96-degree strips of the sky called sectors for about a month using its four cameras. The mission spent its first year observing 13 sectors comprising the southern sky and then spent another year imaging the northern sky. Now in its extended mission, TESS has turned around to resume surveying the south."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard2020/nasa-s-planet-hunter-completes-its-primary-mission">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The National Science Foundation facility is closed while engineers review the damage and assess the extent of repairs that will be needed to bring the telescope back online. One of the auxiliary cables that helps support a metal platform in place above the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, broke on Monday (Aug. 10) causing a 100-foot-long gash on the telescope’s reflector dish. Operations at the UCF-managed observatory are stopped until repairs can be made. The break occurred about 2:45 a.m. When the three-inch cable fell it also damaged about 6-8 panels in the Gregorian Dome and twisted the platform used to access the dome. It is not yet clear what caused the cable to break."</em> <a href="https://www.ucf.edu/news/broken-cable-damages-arecibo-observatory/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-intel-tech-idUSKCN2591X1">Intel says new transistor technology could boost chip performance 20%</a></h2>

<p><em>"Intel Corp (INTC.O) on Thursday disclosed a new method for making transistors on semiconductors that its chief architect said could boost the performance Intel’s next round of processors by as much as 20%. The Santa Clara, California-based company is one of the few remaining in the world that both designs and manufactures its own chips. But its manufacturing operations have become a concern among investors after Intel last month said that its next-generation chip-making process, called its 7-nanonmeter process node, would be delayed. Analysts believe the delays could cement the lead that rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW) have gained in making smaller, more power efficient chips. Intel’s shares have fallen nearly 20% since the delays were disclosed. On Thursday, Intel sought to buck the notion that the single-number names given to each generation of chip process node tell the entire story by disclosing improvements on its existing 10-nanonmeter process node."</em> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-intel-tech-idUSKCN2591X1">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Electronic filters are part of the inner workings of our phones and other wireless devices. They eliminate or enhance specific input signals to achieve the desired output signals. They are essential, but take up space on the chips that researchers are on a constant quest to make smaller. A new study demonstrates the successful integration of the individual elements that make up electronic filters onto a single component, significantly reducing the amount of space taken up by the device. Researchers at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign have ditched the conventional 2D on-chip lumped or distributed filter network design – composed of separate inductors and capacitors – for a single, space-saving 3D rolled membrane that contains both independently designed elements.

<p><em>"A computational framework for solving linear inverse problems takes a parallel computing approach In this era of big data, there are some problems in scientific computing that are so large, so complex and contain so much information that attempting to solve them would be too big of a task for most computers. Now, researchers at the McKelvey School of Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis have developed a new algorithm for solving a common class of problem — known as linear inverse problems — by breaking them down into smaller tasks, each of which can be solved in parallel on standard computers. The research, from the lab of Jr-Shin Li, professor in the Preston M. Green Department of Electrical &amp; Systems Engineering, was published July 30 in the journal Scientific Reports. In addition to providing a framework for solving this class of problems, the approach, called Parallel Residual Projection (PRP), also delivers enhanced security and mitigates privacy concerns. Linear inverse problems are those that attempt to take observational data and try to find a model that describes it. In their simplest form, they may look familiar: 2x+y = 1, x-y = 3."</em> <a href="https://source.wustl.edu/2020/08/break-it-down-a-new-way-to-address-common-computing-problem/">[...]</a>

Employing a neural network approach designed to detect patterns, the NIST model has many possible applications in modern life. NIST’s neural network model captured 97% of objects in a defined set of test images, locating the objects’ centers to within a few pixels of manually selected locations. “The purpose of the project was to recover the lost data in journal articles,” NIST computer scientist Adele Peskin explained. “But the study of small, dense object detection has a lot of other applications. Object detection is used in a wide range of image analyses, self-driving cars, machine inspections, and so on, for which small, dense objects are particularly hard to locate and separate.” The researchers took the data from journal articles dating as far back as the early 1900s in a database of metallic properties at NIST’s Thermodynamics Research Center (TRC)."</em> <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2020/08/recovering-data-nists-neural-network-model-finds-small-objects-dense-images">[...]</a>

However, the level of detail is limited by the size of the wavelength in question – until now.

Quantum materials host strongly interacting electrons with special properties, such as entangled trajectories, that could provide building blocks for super-fast quantum computers. They also can become superconductors that could slash energy consumption by making power transmission and electronic devices more efficient. “The buckling we discovered in graphene mimics the effect of colossally large magnetic fields that are unattainable with today’s magnet technologies, leading to dramatic changes in the material’s electronic properties,” said lead author Eva Y. Andrei, Board of Governors professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy in the School of Arts and Sciences at Rutgers University–New Brunswick. “Buckling of stiff thin films like graphene laminated on flexible materials is gaining ground as a platform for stretchable electronics with many important applications, including eye-like digital cameras, energy harvesting, skin sensors, health monitoring devices like tiny robots and intelligent surgical gloves. Our discovery opens the way to the development of devices for controlling nano-robots that may one day play a role in biological diagnostics and tissue repair.” The scientists studied buckled graphene crystals whose properties change radically when they’re cooled, creating essentially new materials with electrons that slow down, become aware of each other and interact strongly, enabling the emergence of fascinating phenomena such as superconductivity and magnetism, according to Andrei."</em> <a href="https://www.rutgers.edu/news/quantum-materials-quest-could-benefit-graphene-buckles">[...]</a>

Microscopic patterns on some surfaces reflect light in such a way that different wavelengths collide and interfere with one another. For example, a peacock’s feathers are made of transparent protein fibers that have no intrinsic color themselves, yet we see shifting, iridescent blue, green, and purple hues because of the nanoscale structures on their surfaces.

In the transition to a decarbonized electric power system, variable renewable energy (VRE) resources such as wind and solar photovoltaics play a vital role due to their availability, scalability, and affordability. However, the degree to which VRE resources can be successfully deployed to decarbonize the electric power system hinges on the future availability and cost of energy storage technologies. In a paper recently published in Applied Energy, researchers from MIT and Princeton University examine battery storage to determine the key drivers that impact its economic value, how that value might change with increasing deployment over time, and the implications for the long-term cost-effectiveness of storage. “Battery storage helps make better use of electricity system assets, including wind and solar farms, natural gas power plants, and transmission lines, and that can defer or eliminate unnecessary investment in these capital-intensive assets,” says Dharik Mallapragada, the paper’s lead author. “Our paper demonstrates that this ‘capacity deferral,’ or substitution of batteries for generation or transmission capacity, is the primary source of storage value.” Other sources of storage value include providing operating reserves to electricity system operators, avoiding fuel cost and wear and tear incurred by cycling on and off gas-fired power plants, and shifting energy from low price periods to high value periods — but the paper showed that these sources are secondary in importance to value from avoiding capacity investments."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/assessing-value-battery-energy-storage-future-power-grids-increasing-integration-wind-and-solar-0812">[...]</a>

Although solar power brings many benefits, its use depends heavily on the distribution of sunlight, which can be limited in many locations and is completely unavailable at night. Systems that store energy produced during the day are typically expensive, thus driving up the cost of using solar power. To find a less-expensive alternative, researchers led by Shanhui Fan from Stanford University looked to radiative cooling. This approach uses the temperature difference resulting from heat absorbed from the surrounding air and the radiant cooling effect of cold space to generate electricity."</em> <a href="https://www.osa.org/en-us/about_osa/newsroom/news_releases/2020/researchers_design_efficient_low-cost_system_for_p/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://mipt.ru/english/news/new_phase_of_nanoconfined_water_discovered">New phase of nanoconfined water discovered</a></h2>

<p><em>"Researchers at MIPT Laboratory of Terahertz Spectroscopy together with their Russian and international colleagues discovered a new phase of nanoconfined water; separate water molecules that are confined within nanocavities formed by ions of cordierite crystal lattice. The first reliable experimental observation of a phase transition in a network of dipole-dipole coupled water molecules is, in and of itself, an important fundamental breakthrough. But apart from that, the discovered phenomenon can also find practical applications in ferroelectrics, artificial quantum systems, and biocompatible nanoelectronics. The study was a joint effort of MIPT scientists and researchers from Shubnikov Institute of Crystallography, A. M. Prokhorov General Physics Institute of RAS, Skoltech, Sobolev Institute of Geology and Mineralogy, and Novosibirsk State University, as well as their colleagues from Germany (Stuttgart University), the Czech Republic (Prague Institute of Physics), and Japan (University of Tokyo). The results of the study have been reported in Nature Communications. “We are searching for new phases of electric dipole lattice, i. e. an ensemble of interacting point electric dipoles,” explained Mikhail Belyanchikov, one of the study’s initiators and a junior researcher at MIPT Laboratory of Terahertz Spectroscopy."</em> <a href="https://mipt.ru/english/news/new_phase_of_nanoconfined_water_discovered">[...]</a>

This device continuously scans the local area WiFi channels in promiscuous mode, looks at the headers &amp; tosses the payloads( a bit like reading the envelope but not opening it). We can then grab a list of who is sending &amp; display some information. Since we don't want to creep people out too much we only display the lower three bytes of the senders MAC (which is a six byte number) the top bytes are used for manufacture information so the lower 3 tend to be random enough to get a pretty colors(the program further reduces this to 5-6-5 color code) .

<p><em>"A small little console that allows you to quickly set, test, try many different actuators (e.g. servos, stepper, ultrasonic, DHT22, etc... ) AVRaft - a makers tool/toy I was fustrated to always needing to grab my ardunio, breadboard and jumper wires just to test a small servo, especially since I needed to connect all this mess to a computer. At the end of the day, it was a lot of work for not much and since I don't have a dedicated workshop, I could not afford leaving everything out. The idea thus came, "Maybe I could use one of my arduino nanos to make a small console with everything already set up". I wanted to make use of a LCD screen, but in order to keep as many pins available I had to use the I2C module that comes attach to many LCD screens. I had put together the bare minimum in terms of electronics to get the idea."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/willmendil/avraft-makers-tool-for-testing-actuators-5d6d1e">[...]</a>

<p><em>"I have always been fascinated by the precision mechanics present in mechanical hard drives and every time I have a broken one I try to find a use for it. This, together with the fact that I think it's a shame to throw away such a precious piece of technology, made me think of this project. The main idea of the project is to use the mechanics related to the movement of the magnetic head of an old hard disk to create a display showing the current time (it can be easily changed to display whatever you want). By replacing the Hard disk magnetic head with a bar of leds and by turning on the leds at the right time it is possible, using the persistence of the human eye, to form an image. For the led bar I used one equipped with the well known LED WS2812B that gives the possibility to control the leds with only one pin (besides the power supply of course). It should be noted that the flickering that you see in the video is not real."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/PendoLux/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"I've been wanting to make a simple LED Light box for some time now so decided to build one. I had some filament LED's left over from another build which worked perfectly to illuminate the diffused acrylic. You usually find filament LED's inside light bulbs which are in the style of Edison light globes. However, you can also buy them individually for pretty cheap. They throw off a lot of light and when you use some diffusing acrylic, you get a beautiful, soft light. Instead of using a toggle switch to turn the LED's on and off, I used a mercury switch."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/LED-Cube-Light/">[...]</a>

In the recent years, air pollution has been a growing concern for the harmful effects it has on our environment. The problem is prevailing particularly in urban cities because of the increased traffic and a wide array of industries which produce a lot of harmful gases as a bi-product of manufacturing. Apart from this, indoor air pollution is also a great concern in metro cities. According to research, the air inside our house is even more polluted compared to the air in outdoor environments."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/dhairya-parikh/lora-powered-air-quality-monitoring-system-e96aa9">[...]</a>
