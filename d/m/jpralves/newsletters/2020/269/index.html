<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1864, o físico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walther_Nernst">Walther Nernst</a>. Ele foi um dos fundadores da química moderna. Em 1889, ele desenvolveu a sua teoria do potencial eléctrico e condução de soluções electrolíticas (a Equação de Nernst) e introduziu o produto de solubilidade para explicar as reacções de precipitação. Em 1906, Nernst mostrou que é possível determinar a constante de equilíbrio para uma reacção química a partir de dados térmicos e, ao fazê-lo, formulou o que ele próprio chamava de terceira lei da termodinâmica. Isto afirma que a entropia (uma medida termodinâmica de desordem em um sistema) aproxima-se de zero à medida que a temperatura vai em direcção ao zero absoluto. Por isto, ele recebeu o Prémio Nobel de 1920 em Química. Em 1918, ele explicou a explosão do H2-Cl2 na exposição à luz como uma reacção em cadeia do átomo.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1894, o cientista alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Oberth">Hermann Oberth</a>. Ele era um dos três fundadores do voo espacial (com Tsiolkovsky e Goddard). Após uma lesão na Primeira Guerra Mundial, ele elaborou uma proposta para um foguete de longo alcance, propulsor líquido, que o Ministério da Guerra considerou fantasioso. Até a dissertação sobre o seu projecto de foguete foi rejeitada pela Universidade de Heidelberg. Quando o publicou como Die Rakete zu den Planetenräumen (1923; "O foguete para o espaço interplanetário"), ele ganhou reconhecimento pela sua análise matemática da velocidade do foguete que lhe permitiria escapar da atracção gravitacional da Terra. Ele recebeu uma patente romena em 1931 por um projecto de foguete com propulsor líquido. O seu primeiro foguete foi lançado em 7 de maio de 1931, perto de Berlim.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1907, o físico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Hans_D._Jensen">J. Hans D. Jensen</a>. Ele propôs a teoria da estrutura nuclear dos núcleos - protões e neutrões - agrupados em camadas semelhantes a cebolas de conchas concêntricas. Ele sugeriu que os núcleos giravam em seu próprio eixo enquanto se moviam numa órbita dentro da concha e que certos padrões no número de núcleos por concha tornavam o núcleo mais estável. Os cientistas já sabiam que os electrões que orbitam o núcleo estavam dispostos em diferentes camadas. Pelo seu modelo do núcleo, Jensen partilhou o Prémio Nobel de 1963 em física (com Maria Goeppert-Mayer, que chegou à mesma hipótese de forma independente nos EUA; e Eugene P. Wigner, por trabalhos não relacionados.) Nos anos 50, Jensen trabalhou em radioactividade.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou foi anunciado o supercomputador Japonês Fugaku, que está a ser desenvolvido em conjunto pela RIKEN e Fujitsu Limited, ocupou o primeiro lugar na lista Top500, um ranking dos supercomputadores mais rápidos do mundo. Ele também limpou os outros rankings de desempenho de supercomputadores, ocupando o primeiro lugar no HPCG, um ranking de supercomputadores executando aplicações do mundo real, o HPL-AI, que classifica os supercomputadores com base nos seus recursos de desempenho para tarefas tipicamente usadas em aplicativos de inteligência artificial e Graph 500, que classifica os sistemas com base em cargas com uso intenso de dados. É a primeira vez na história que o mesmo supercomputador se torna o número 1 no Top500, HPCG e Graph500 simultaneamente. Este supercomputador é baseado em tecnologia ARM A64FX com 48 Cores a 2.2 GHz da Fujitsu e tem 7.299.072 CPU cores. Em termos de capacidade de processamento tem 415 Petaflops podendo atingir um máximo de 513 PetaFlops e tem disponível 4.87PB de RAM. Para funcionar consome uns estrondosos 28MW de energia. Ele usa o sistema operativo Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Por comparação com o anterior primeiro colocado - o Summit da IBM - este tinha "apenas" 148-PFLOPS de capacidade de calculo e consumia "apenas" 10MW.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos assim como projetos de maker. São apresentadas as revistas MagPI Nº 95 de Julho e newselectronics de 23 de Junho.</p>

<p><em>"The supercomputer Fugaku, which is being developed jointly by RIKEN and Fujitsu Limited based on Arm® technology, has taken the top spot on the Top500 list, a ranking of the world’s fastest supercomputers. It also swept the other rankings of supercomputer performance, taking first place on the HPCG, a ranking of supercomputers running real-world applications, HPL-AI, which ranks supercomputers based on their performance capabilities for tasks typically used in artificial intelligence applications, and Graph 500, which ranks systems based on data-intensive loads. This is the first time in history that the same supercomputer has become No.1 on Top500, HPCG, and Graph500 simultaneously. The awards were announced on June 22 at the ISC High Performance 2020 Digital, an international high-performance computing conference. On the Top500, it achieved a LINPACK score of 415.53 petaflops, a much higher score than the 148.6 petaflops of its nearest competitor, Summit in the United States, using 152,064 of its eventual 158,976 nodes. This marks the first time a Japanese system has taken the top ranking since June 2011, when the K computer—Fugaku’s predecessor—took first place."</em> <a href="https://www.riken.jp/en/news_pubs/news/2020/20200623_1/index.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"China launched the last satellite in its Beidou navigation network on Tuesday, completing a new rival to GPS and cementing its place in an elite group of countries with their own global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). To date, there are only four major GNSS networks: GPS (US), GLONASS (Russia), Galileo (European Union) and now Beidou. India and Japan operate smaller systems. Most people are familiar with GPS, which is used for everything from personal navigation on your smartphone to tracking planes and container ships around the world. Beidou is China's alternative system. It's named after the Chinese word for the Big Dipper constellation, and has taken almost two decades to complete."</em> <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/24/tech/china-beidou-satellite-gps-intl-hnk/index.html">[...]</a>

For details about Maxim Integrated’s low-power microcontroller solutions › To order MAX32670 or learn more › For a hi-res image › In many industrial and IoT applications, high energy particles and other environmental challenges present the danger of bombarding memory and creating bit flips during the normal course of operations – especially as process nodes drop to 40nm and lower. This can disrupt MCU operation and produce incorrect or even dangerous results. To prevent catastrophic ramifications like these, the MAX32670 protects its entire memory footprint (384kB flash and 128kB SRAM) with ECC to prevent bit flips and enhance reliability.

It’s surrounded by a vast debris disk in which moving clumps of dust have been tracked, and now, thanks to TESS and Spitzer, it has a planet with a direct size measurement,” said Bryson Cale, a doctoral student at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. “There is no other known system that checks all of these important boxes.” The new planet, AU Mic b, is described in a paper co-authored by Cale and led by his advisor Peter Plavchan, an assistant professor of physics and astronomy at George Mason. Their report was published on Wednesday, June 24, in the journal Nature. AU Mic b is featured in a new NASA poster available in English and Spanish, part of a Galaxy of Horrors series."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020/nasa-s-tess-spitzer-missions-discover-a-world-orbiting-a-unique-young-star">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=217279">Physicists Publish Worldwide Consensus of Muon Magnetic Moment Calculation</a></h2>

<p><em>"For decades, scientists studying the muon have been puzzled by a strange pattern in the way muons rotate in magnetic fields, one that left physicists wondering if it can be explained by the Standard Model — the best tool physicists have to understand the universe. This week, an international team of more than 170 physicists published the most reliable prediction so far for the theoretical value of the muon’s anomalous magnetic moment, which would account for its particular rotation, or precession. The magnetic moment of subatomic particles is generally expressed in terms of the dimensionless Landé factor, called g. While a number of international groups have worked separately on the calculation, this publication marks the first time the global theoretical physics community has come together to publish a consensus value for the muon’s magnetic moment. The result differs from the most recent experimental measurement, which was performed at Brookhaven National Laboratory in 2004, but not significantly enough to unambiguously answer this question. Now the world awaits the result from Fermilab’s current Muon g-2 experiment. In the upcoming months, physicists working on the experiment will unveil their preliminary measurement for the value."</em> <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=217279">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Mixing and matching computational models of 2D materials led scientists at Rice University to the realization that excitons — quasiparticles that exist when electrons and holes briefly bind — can be manipulated in new and useful ways. The researchers identified a small set of 2D compounds with similar atomic lattice dimensions that, when placed together, would allow excitons to form spontaneously. Generally, excitons happen when energy from light or electricity boosts electrons and holes into a higher state. But in a few of the combinations predicted by Rice materials theorist Boris Yakobson and his team, excitons were observed stabilizing at the materials’ ground state. According to their determination, these excitons at their lowest energy state could condense into a superfluidlike phase. The discovery shows promise for electronic, spintronic and quantum computing applications."</em> <a href="https://news.rice.edu/2020/06/15/excitons-form-superfluid-in-certain-2d-combos/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Tower block games such as Jenga can be used to explain to schoolchildren how lithium-ion batteries work, meeting an educational need to better understand a power source that has become vital to everyday life. While lithium-ion batteries are abundant in so many of our electronic devices, from smart phones to electric vehicles, the resources available to teach children how they work and why they are important are limited. A team in the University of Birmingham’s School of Chemistry, has devised an educational tool which uses the tower block game Jenga to explain the processes at work inside the battery cells and the electrochemistry behind them. Their method is published in the Journal of Chemical Education. A rechargeable Li-ion battery consists of an oxide and a graphite electrode. These are commonly built in layers separated with an electrolyte."</em> <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/latest/2020/06/using-jenga-to-explain-lithium-ion-batteries.aspx">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A water-stable dopant enhances and stabilizes the performance of electron-transporting organic electrochemical transistors. Doping is commonly used to improve performance in semiconducting devices but has not previously been successful for electron transporting or n-type, organic electronic materials. Now, an approach developed by KAUST uses a dopant, an additive that boosts the electronic performance and water stability of an n-type semiconducting polymer, to produce the first water-stable n-doped, organic electrochemical transistors, known as OECTs. Organic electrochemical transistors comprise plastic-mixed conductors—active semiconductor layers that conduct ionic and electronic charges at the same time. These mixed conductors allow OECTs to convert ionic signals in electrolytes and biological fluids into electronic signals.

<p><em>"Exotic states called Kohn anomalies could offer clues to why some materials have the electronic properties they do. An exotic physical phenomenon known as a Kohn anomaly has been found for the first time in an unexpected type of material by researchers at MIT and elsewhere. They say the finding could provide new insights into certain fundamental processes that help determine why metals and other materials display the complex electronic properties that underlie much of today’s technology. The way electrons interact with phonons — which are essentially vibrations passing through a crystalline material — determines the physical processes that take place inside many electronic devices. These interactions affect the way metals resist electric current, the temperature at which some materials suddenly become superconductors, and the very low temperature requirements for quantum computers, among many other processes. But electron-phonon interactions have been difficult to study in detail because they are generally very weak."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/kohn-anomaly-quantum-devices-0612">[...]</a>

An improved ability to control the magnetization of electrodes made at KAUST from ferromagnets could help develop more energy-efficient devices for spintronic applications, including data storage technologies, wearable electronics and implantable medical devices. Fueled by the demand for information storage technologies with increased capacity, miniature devices called magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) have emerged as a promising way to store large amounts of data. MTJs consist of tiny ferromagnets separated by an ultrathin insulating layer. Their electrical resistance can be switched between low and high states—corresponding with the binary bits 0 and 1—and so can be used to store information in magnetoresistive random access memory and other spintronic devices. Traditionally, this switching has used a magnetic field, a spin-orbit torque or a spin-transfer torque, which applies a high electric current density to the device that then dissipates large amounts of energy."</em> <a href="https://discovery.kaust.edu.sa/en/article/942/a-new-spin-on-low-power-data-storage">[...]</a>

The work is published June 15 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. In traditional extrusion-based 3D printers, printing material is pushed through a nozzle and added to the structure repeatedly until the product is complete. While this is efficient and cost-effective, it makes it hard to print structures made of more than one material, and getting the right amount of softness can be challenging.

Their properties result from the fact that their constituents interact very strongly with each other: new features appear at the collective level, that are not present in isolated particles.

I created a simple midi controller using Arduino Pro micro and some IR-proximity detectors board which has an in-build comparator , this should be available fairly easy and cheap. This project can be used on any Arduino which has 32u4 based board, this was done due to the ability to use these board has MIDI without the head ache you have to go through using hairless midi and the glitches associated with it. This project was done for 7 major notes which could easily be extended for other notes. I used calkwalk by bandlab as my DAW because its cool and free. Hope you have fun making this."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Non-Contact-Midi-Controller/">[...]</a>

Once a player hits a predetermined score, they win the game and the box opens, revealing the prize. I had a few requirements: the box needed to be sturdy, capable of being manhandled by a small child; the compartment had to be big enough to hold small gifts; and I wanted some way of changing the difficulty level, without allowing the players to do it themselves. Here's a video of the whole process, wherein I learn how to use Tinkercad, design the box and circuit, and then proceed to the actual build.

For people who have mild symptoms or are still asymptomatic but fear having been in contact with the virus, the advice given by doctors is that they need to measure their temperature at least twice a day and monitor it to help determine if they are getting better or worse.

Using the timers can be intimidating if you start from the ATMEGA328 full datasheet, which has 90 pages dedicated to their description! Several built-in Arduino commands already use the timers, for example millis(), delay(), tone(), AnalogWrite() and the servo library. But to use their full power, youll need to set them up through the registers.

<p><em>"A while ago I started using home assistant on a pi and bought some inexpensive 433Mhz ac wireless switches. However, after one month of intense use the Raspberry Pi didn't have enough power, so I bought a cheap computer of eBay for this purpose and it worked well expect that I didn't have control over my switches. Sure I could have use the raspberry in conjunction with the computer but that would be overkill, so I started designing an Arduino on a stick with USB and 433Mhz tx and rx. The first design I made was way too optimistic I planed to use a rf switch to switch between rx and tx and use a single sma port for the antenna but that didn't go so well and neither tx nor rx was working, so I just gave up for a few weeks and then made version two. Hardware Version two is smaller and have two coiled antennas instead of a sma port and it works well enough. It's still based around an atmega328 running at 16MHz with the Arduino UNO bootloader and a CH340 USB to Serial converter."</em> <a href="https://blog.turtleforgaming.fr/open433-lets-turn-light-on-with-the-computer">[...]</a>
