<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1891, o inventor norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Sarnoff">David Sarnoff</a>. Ele foi pioneiro no desenvolvimento de transmissões de rádio e televisão. Ele foi o primeiro responsável da RCA e fundou a rede de televisão NBC (1926). Ele tornou-se um operador de radio e conheceu Marconi em 1906. Prevendo as múltiplas possibilidades do rádio, tornou-se gerente comercial da American Marconi em 1917, já a prever que o rádio se tornaria "um utilitário doméstico no mesmo sentido que o piano ou o fonógrafo".</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1910, o engenheiro aeronáutico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Johnson_(engineer)">Kelly Johnson</a>. Ele enquanto geria a divisão secreta de projectos da Lockheed, conhecida como "Skunk Works", contribuiu para o desenvolvimento de mais de 40 aviões. Os seus primeiros trabalhos incluíram o caça P-38 Lightning (1938) e o bombardeiro Hudson. Mais tarde, ele desenvolveu os aviões supersónicos e de maior voo do mundo. O U-2 (1954) foi o primeiro avião projectado para voos de rotina acima de 60.000 pés. O F-104 Starfighter (1954) era capaz de voar ao dobro da velocidade do som, estabelecendo recordes mundiais de 1.400 mph e 103.000 pés de altitude.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1947, o Físico teórico e cosmologista norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Guth">Alan Guth</a>. Ele é pioneiro na apresentação do modelo de expansão do universo. Este modelo explica o crescimento exponencial do universo em meras fracções de segundo após o Big Bang e sua expansão contínua hoje.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que o Raspberry PI comemora o seu oitavo aniversário. E nesta comemoração, ajudada pela redução dos custos de produção foi anunciado que o Raspberry PI 4 B de 2 GB de memória irá ficar ao preço do de 1GB, ou seja sensivelmente 35€.
Também esta semana ficámos a saber que o nosso planeta tem uma 2ª Lua! Bom, parece que de acordo com observações dos astrónomos Kacper Wierzchos e Theodore Pruyne este objecto tem entre 1,8 e 3,8 metros de diâmetro. Foi designada de 2020 CD3 e dá a volta ao planeta a cada 47 dias, tendo ficado preso na força gravitacional da Terra à cerca de três anos. No entanto este asteróide está apenas de visita e assim que se conseguir libertar da força de atracção da Terra seguirá o seu caminho, estimando-se que seja já em Abril deste ano.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. É apresentada a revista MagPI Nº91 do mês de Março assim como a revista newelectronics de 25 de Fevereiro e o livro "Code the Classics – Volume 1".</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/new-price-raspberry-pi-4-2gb/">A birthday gift: 2GB Raspberry Pi 4 now only $35</a></h2>

<p><em>"TL;DR: it’s our eighth birthday, and falling RAM prices have allowed us to cut the price of the 2GB Raspberry Pi 4 to $35. You can buy one here. Happy birthday to us In two days’ time, it will be our eighth birthday (or our second, depending on your point of view). Many of you set your alarms and got up early on the morning of 29 February 2012, to order your Raspberry Pi from our newly minted licensee partners, RS Components and Premier Farnell. In the years since, we’ve sold over 30 million Raspberry Pi computers; we’ve seen our products used in an incredible range of applications all over the world (and occasionally off it); and we’ve found our own place in a community of makers, hobbyists, engineers and educators who are changing the world, one project, or one student, at a time. The first Raspberry Pi When we first started talking about Raspberry Pi 1 Model B back in 2011, we were very clear about what we were trying to build: a desktop Linux PC with interfacing capabilities for $35."</em> <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/new-price-raspberry-pi-4-2gb/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"For the last two and a half years, the Earth may have had two moons. There’s the obvious one that raises the tides and can often be seen during the day, and now researchers have identified a candidate for a second. The “mini-moon,” as some are calling it, is a couch-sized speck roughly 10 trillion times dimmer than its more famous counterpart. And astronomers found the satellite just in time, because soon it will be gone forever. Kacper Wierzchos and Theodore Pruyne, astronomers with the NASA-funded Catalina Sky Survey, first spotted the object. They estimate it measures between six and 12 feet long, and it streaked across the sky on February 15 while they scanned for asteroids."</em> <a href="https://www.popsci.com/story/space/earth-has-a-second-mini-moon-minimoon-mini-moon/">[...]</a>

The issue arose with the change to a USB Type-C connector for powering the device. An error in detection circuitry on the Pi side caused some power adapters to mistake the computer for an audio device, and therefore not shove the expected power down the line. The Raspberry Pi Foundation's own USB power supply (yours for £8) was fine, other cables (marked with an "e") were less so. Pi fans have been speculating over the last few months that the fix had landed after purchasers reported spotting a new design in the wild. Back when the snafu was discovered, Pi supremo Eben Upton told The Register that a solution for the issue would "probably get rolled up into a design-for-manufacture spin of the PCB at some point"."</em> <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/02/21/pi_4_fixed/">[...]</a>

Designers want to replace wasteful plastic with sustainable plant derived compounds, but this can be a challenge without knowledge of plant compound’s molecular structure. A new technique developed at Aalto University should allow researchers to get this essential information. To achieve this, the researchers combined a common materials analysis technique with artificial intelligence. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) uses an incredibly fine needle to measure the size and shape of nanometer sized objects, and can already be used to measure the structure of flat, pancake-like planar molecules. By training an artificial intelligence algorithm on lots of AFM data, scientists can now identify more complex molecules with exciting real-world applications."</em> <a href="https://www.aalto.fi/en/news/researchers-develop-new-methods-for-studying-materials-at-the-smallest-possible-scale">[...]</a>

Results published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society provide new insights on the way molecules pack and order themselves into “tunable” interfaces, monolayer thick surfaces with structures that can be modified for specific functionalities. “Understanding the design rules of the chemistry happening at the liquid-liquid interface ultimately informs how we can make new materials with custom properties,” said Benjamin Doughty of ORNL’s Chemical Sciences Division. The study expands interest in using soft materials to mimic lipid bilayers — selective membranes with important biological functions, such as processing signals across the brain’s neural network and transporting ions, proteins, and other molecules across cells. Co-authors previously designed biomimetic membranes using lipid-coated water droplets in oil and demonstrated their potential as sensory components for neuromorphic, or brain-like, computers with natural information processing, learning and memory. “Because lipids are inherently fragile and decay, we are interested in developing polymer-based counterparts that offer stability and can also give us a range of natural functionalities,” said Pat Collier of ORNL’s Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences, a DOE Office of Science User Facility."</em> <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/news/polymers-get-caught-love-hate-chemistry-oil-and-water">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Dr. Hun-Gi Jung and his research team at the Center for Energy Storage Research of the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST, President Lee Byung Gwon) have announced the development of silicon anode materials that can increase battery capacity four-fold in comparison to graphite anode materials and enable rapid charging to more than 80% capacity in only five minutes. When applied to batteries for electric vehicles, the new materials are expected to more than double their driving range. The batteries currently installed in mass-produced electric vehicles use graphite anode materials, but their low capacity contributes to electric vehicles' having a shorter driving range than vehicles with internal combustion engines. Consequently, silicon, with an energy storage capacity 10-times greater than graphite, has drawn attention as a next-generation anode material for the development of long-range electric vehicles. However, silicon materials have not yet been commercialized because their volume expands rapidly and storage capacity decreases significantly during charge and discharge cycles, which limits commercialization. A number of methods have been suggested for enhancing the stability of silicon as an anode material, but the cost and complexity of these methods have prevented silicon from replacing graphite."</em> <a href="https://phys.org/news/2020-02-high-capacity-ev-battery-materials-range.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Method with polarized light can create and measure nonsymmetrical states in a layered material. Some molecules, including most of the ones in living organisms, have shapes that can exist in two different mirror-image versions. The right- and left-handed versions can sometimes have different properties, such that only one of them carries out the molecule’s functions. Now, a team of physicists has found that a similarly asymmetrical pattern can be induced and measured at will in certain exotic materials, using a special kind of light beam to stimulate the material. In this case, the phenomenon of “handedness,” known as chirality, occurs not in the structure of the molecules themselves, but in a kind of patterning in the density of electrons within the material. The researchers found that this asymmetric patterning can be induced by shining a circularly polarized mid-infrared light at an unusual material, a form of transition-metal dichalcogenide semimetal called TiSe2, or titanium diselenide."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2020/using-light-put-twist-electrons-0226">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This article shows how you can build a minimal microcontroller on a breadboard based on the ATmega4809, the microprocessor used in the latest AVR-based Arduino boards It includes a USB-to-serial converter so you can connect it to your computer's USB port and program it from the Arduino IDE. Introduction Arduino's successors to their classic Arduino Uno board are the Arduino Nano Every [1] and the Arduino Uno WiFi Rev2 [2]. These are based on the ATmega4809 [3], one of Microchip's AVR processors from their new 0-series ATmega range. As well as having more program memory and RAM than the Arduino Uno's ATmega328P, the ATmega4809 has some interesting new features, including a 20MHz clock, an event system, and configurable custom logic. One of the attractions of the old ATmega328P was that it was available in a DIP package, making it ideal for prototyping. Microchip's latest range of AVR processors aren't available in DIP packages, with one exception: the ATmega4809 [4]."</em> <a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2QVZ">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Pictured below is a controller we recently made for use in a poultry egg incubator, designed to keep eggs within a very narrow specific temperature and humidity range for a few weeks. This is achieved using a heater, a fan, and a humidifier. The eggs need to be turned at least three times per day every day except for the last few days before hatching. Previously we made a Controller for Poultry Incubator which had a motor which was turned on and off at different times of the day to turn the eggs. For this new incubator, the motor used is a very slow turning 12 VAC device makes 6 full rotations every 24 hours. That motor therefore did not need to be controlled with a timer – it is just left running at all times."</em> <a href="http://www.reuk.co.uk/wordpress/poultry-egg-incubator-with-humidity-sensor/">[...]</a>

I recently purchased several new lights for an auxiliary workspace in my room, but there was a problem: it took far too long to turn the lights on and off. I also wanted to add some colored ambient lighting, and that also needed a way to be controlled, so I decided to create a web-based controller and WiFi-connected hardware to adjust the lights. Hardware Needed First and foremost, there had to be a webserver running the necessary services, such as MySQL, NodeJS, and Apache. I have published a guide on how to convert an old PC into a home server that can run all of these, which can be viewed here.

The most common way of doing that is to write a program which to read the pin value and "Serial.print" to the serial monitor or display the figure on display equiment such as digital display tube or OLED.
