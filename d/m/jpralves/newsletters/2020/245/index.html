<p><em>"Next time you're outside on a bright, sunny day, take note that the shadow you're casting does not have a sharp edge. In fact, a diffuse penumbra surrounds most any shadow, unless the light is a point source. A penumbral lunar eclipse is scheduled for Friday (Jan. 10). No part of the moon enters Earth's much darker umbra, as happens during a partial or total lunar eclipse. But on Jan 10-11 (depending on your location), just about the best penumbral eclipse possible will occur. The lower portion of the moon will track deep into the Earth's outer shadow, and the natural satellite's southern limb will miss the Earth's umbra by only about 225 miles (360 kilometers), or nearly 10% of the moon's diameter."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/penumbral-lunar-eclipse-jan-10-2020-guide.html">[...]</a>

The printers - used industrially and also on a smaller scale to make digitally designed, three-dimensional objects from plastic - have not been used much for building. This one used a special mixture of cement, a Dubai government statement said, and reliability tests were done in Britain and China. The one-storey prototype building, with floorspace of about 250 square meters (2,700 square feet), used a 20-foot (6-metre)by 120-foot by 40-foot printer, the government said. “This is the first 3D-printed building in the world, and it’s not just a building, it has fully functional offices and staff,” the United Arab Emirates Minister of Cabinet Affairs, Mohamed Al Gergawi, said. “We believe this is just the beginning."</em> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-emirates-printing-3d/dubai-says-opens-worlds-first-functioning-3d-printed-office-idUSKCN0YF1OB">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In a surprise announcement, Sony unveiled an electric concept car called the Vision-S during its keynote at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas today. The company said the car has 33 sensors, including a CMOS sensor and a ToF (Time of Flight) sensor (both of which are typically used in cameras) to detect objects and people accurately outside and inside the car. In addition, it uses a Solid State LiDAR to gauge and map the area around the vehicle to avoid collision and drive at a safe distance and speed. According to its specification page, the Vision-S can go from 0-100 km per hour in just 4.8 seconds. In comparison, the top variant of Tesla 3 can hit that speed in 3.4 seconds. For in-car entertainment, the company has included a panoramic screen in the front, on the dashboard, to consume content."</em> <a href="https://thenextweb.com/cars/2020/01/07/in-a-shocking-announcement-sony-just-unveiled-an-electric-car/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Machine-learning system should enable developers to improve computing efficiency in a range of applications. MIT researchers have invented a machine-learning tool that predicts how fast computer chips will execute code from various applications. To get code to run as fast as possible, developers and compilers — programs that translate programming language into machine-readable code — typically use performance models that run the code through a simulation of given chip architectures. Compilers use that information to automatically optimize code, and developers use it to tackle performance bottlenecks on the microprocessors that will run it. But performance models for machine code are handwritten by a relatively small group of experts and are not properly validated. As a consequence, the simulated performance measurements often deviate from real-life results."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2020/tool-how-fast-code-run-chip-0106">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Just as engineers once compressed some of the power of room-sized mainframes into desktop PCs, so too have Stanford researchers shown how to pack some of the punch delivered by today’s ginormous particle accelerators onto a tiny silicon chip. On a hillside above Stanford University, the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory operates a scientific instrument nearly 2 miles long. In this giant accelerator, a stream of electrons flows through a vacuum pipe, as bursts of microwave radiation nudge the particles ever-faster forward until their velocity approaches the speed of light, creating a powerful beam that scientists from around the world use to probe the atomic and molecular structures of inorganic and biological materials. Now, for the first time, scientists at Stanford and SLAC have created a silicon chip that can accelerate electrons – albeit at a fraction of the velocity of that massive instrument – using an infrared laser to deliver, in less than a hair’s width, the sort of energy boost that takes microwaves many feet. Writing in the Jan. 3 issue of Science, a team led by electrical engineer Jelena Vuckovic explained how they carved a nanoscale channel out of silicon, sealed it in a vacuum and sent electrons through this cavity while pulses of infrared light – to which silicon is as transparent as glass is to visible light – were transmitted by the channel walls to speed the electrons along. The accelerator-on-a-chip demonstrated in Science is just a prototype, but Vuckovic said its design and fabrication techniques can be scaled up to deliver particle beams accelerated enough to perform cutting-edge experiments in chemistry, materials science and biological discovery that don’t require the power of a massive accelerator."</em> <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2020/01/02/accelerator-chip-research-fight-cancer/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers at the Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory have developed a quantum chemistry simulation benchmark to evaluate the performance of quantum devices and guide the development of applications for future quantum computers. Their findings were published in npj Quantum Information. Quantum computers use the laws of quantum mechanics and units known as qubits to greatly increase the threshold at which information can be transmitted and processed. Whereas traditional “bits” have a value of either 0 or 1, qubits are encoded with values of both 0 and 1, or any combination thereof, allowing for a vast number of possibilities for storing data. While still in their early stages, quantum systems have the potential to be exponentially more powerful than today’s leading classical computing systems and promise to revolutionize research in materials, chemistry, high-energy physics, and across the scientific spectrum. But because these systems are in their relative infancy, understanding what applications are well suited to their unique architectures is considered an important field of research."</em> <a href="https://ornl.gov/news/ornl-researchers-advance-performance-benchmark-quantum-computers">[...]</a>

We tuned the system to balance a 1 inch diameter steel ball using a PID algorithm. The screen mount was made from acrylic with one 3D printed connection for quick and easy manufacturing. We bought the largest resistive touch screen available for our budget which was a 7x4 inch 4-pin resistive touchscreen from Adafruit to use as our control surface. Using position data from the touchscreen, the microcontroller was able to control the platform position to stabilize the ball through the servos."</em> <a href="https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/FinalProjects/f2019/ghk48_sof23/ghk48_sof23/ghk48_sof23/index.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In the modern age, being able to interface efficiently with a computer is necessary in order to complete many everyday tasks. For individuals lacking manual dexterity, the task of using standard computer peripherals can prove to be nearly impossible. As technology becomes more integrated into different aspects of our society, being able to effectively use the internet is no longer just a matter of luxury or convenience but is instead closer to a basic right as a human being. Developing technology that can enable individuals to access the internet not only makes them more independent but can also aid in the advancement of our society. With a vast majority of modern jobs requiring workers to possess basic computer skills, there exists a market to produce assistive technology for individuals who are unable to effectively utilize conventional peripheral devices. Several current products fulfill this need, yet are often costly, restrictive, and undoubtedly have room for improvement."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Assistive-Tongue-Operated-Mouse-ATOM/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"An alien-themed slot machine powered by an ATtiny85 microprocessor. Odds and payouts emulate typical slot machines found in casinos. A while ago, I was looking at the Arduino Slot Machine by seawarrior181. It seemed a good project to modify and try to get it to run on an ATtiny85 microprocessor. I decided not to include the 4 line LCD display because the statistics wasn’t my primary goal. (It still calculates and stores all the statistics that seawarrior181’s version has, it just doesn’t display them)."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/john-bradnam/matrix-slot-machine-2bcacc">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Sensors and Synthesis Musical instruments such as the piano allow musicians to play in different keys on a single instrument. In contrast, bamboo flutes are designed for only one key. This means flute players must own a different flute for every additional key in which they want to play in. Learn how these three Cornell students built an PIC32 MCU-based electronic flute that reduces the need for owning multiple flutes by incorporating two buttons that allow a flute player to change the key and octave. Our goal for this project was to build an electronic flute that can play in any key. The first step in this project was understanding the design of a bamboo flute, which differs greatly from Western concert flutes."</em> <a href="https://circuitcellar.com/research-design-hub/multi-key-electronic-flute-2/">[...]</a>
