<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1804, o matemático alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Gustav_Jacob_Jacobi">Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi</a>. Ele, com o trabalho independente de Niels Henrik Abel da Noruega, fundou a teoria das funções elípticas. Ele trabalhou igualmente em funções abelianas e descobriu as funções hiperlípticas. Jacobi aplicou o seu trabalho em funções elípticas à teoria dos números. Ele também investigou análise matemática e geometria. Jacobi realizou importantes pesquisas em equações diferenciais parciais da primeira ordem e aplicou-as às equações diferenciais da dinâmica. O seu trabalho sobre determinantes é importante em dinâmica e mecânica quântica e ele estudou o determinante funcional agora chamado de jacobiano.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1815, a matemática inglesa <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">Ada Lovelace</a>. Ela foi educada em particular, no estudo da matemática e da astronomia, além dos temas mais tradicionais. Ela parece ter desenvolvido uma ambição inicial para ser uma cientista famosa. Depois de conhecer Charles Babbage em 1833, ela começou a ajudar no desenvolvimento do seu motor analítico e publicou notas sobre o trabalho. Ela foi uma das primeiras a reconhecer o potencial dos computadores e foi chamada de primeira programadora de computador. (A linguagem de programação Ada tem seu nome.)</p>

<p>Faz hoje 153 anos que os primeiros semáforos a gás foram instalados do lado de fora das Casas do Parlamento, em Londres. Proposto pelo engenheiro ferroviário britânico J. P. Knight para controlar o tráfego de carruagens de cavalos, as luzes de gás eram controladas manualmente por um policia que usava braços semafóricos.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou a cápsula da sonda Japonesa Hayabusa 2, aterrou. Lançada à cerca de seis anos para recolher amostras de asteróides no espaço aterrou no passado sábado na superfície da Terra.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou, a SpaceX, depois de alguns adiamentos lá lançou o foguetão SN8 num voo de teste. O objectivo era subir até uma altitude de 12.5 Kms e depois de realizar algumas manobras complexas no ar — incluindo o "belly flop" como o que a ultima Nave realizará ao voltar à Terra em voos operacionais — e, em seguida, pousar em segurança perto da base de lançamento. O foguetão gigante de 50m de altura conseguiu, aparentemente fazer as manobras com sucesso, com excepção da ultima. O foguetão atingiu a sua posição de aterragem, mas desceu demasiado rápido, explodindo numa bola de fogo 6 minutos e 42 segundos após a descolagem.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos assim como projetos de maker. É apresentado o livro Help! My Computer is Broken e a revista newelectronics de 8 Dezembro.</p>

<p><em>"On December 6, 2020, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has recovered the body of the capsule, the heat shields, and the parachute of the "Hayabusa2" re-entry capsule in the Woomera Prohibited Area (WPA). Tomorrow, the capsule recovery team will extract gas out of the capsule at the operation headquarters in Australia. Researchers considered the gas originates from the precious sample from Asteroid Ryugu. After the capsule separation, the spacecraft performed trajectory correction maneuvers three times every 30 minutes to depart from the Earth's sphere from 15:30 to 16:30 on December 5 (JST). The Hayabusa2 team members confirmed the trajectory correction maneuvers' success at 16:31 on the same day (JST). The current status of the spacecraft is normal."</em> <a href="https://global.jaxa.jp/press/2020/12/20201206-1_e.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"SpaceX's Starship spaceflight system just took a big step on its path to Mars. The latest Starship prototype, a shiny silver vehicle known as SN8, launched on an epic high-altitude test flight today (Dec. 9), taking off at 5:45 p.m. EST (2245 GMT) from SpaceX's facility near the South Texas village of Boca Chica. The goal was to soar about 7.8 miles (12.5 kilometers) into the sky, perform some complex aerial maneuvers — including a "belly flop" like the one the final Starship will perform when coming back to Earth on operational flights — and then land safely near the launch stand. The 165-foot-tall (50 meters) SN8 appeared to notch all of these big milestones, except for the final one: The vehicle hit its landing mark but came in too fast, exploding in a dramatic fireball 6 minutes and 42 seconds after liftoff. SN8's rapid unplanned disassembly did nothing to dampen the spirits of SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk, who was thrilled by the results of today's flight. "Fuel header tank pressure was low during landing burn, causing touchdown velocity to be high &amp; RUD, but we got all the data we needed!"</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-starship-sn8-test-launch-landing-explosion">[...]</a>

The sensor is a major breakthrough for fields such as image recognition, robotics and artificial intelligence. Findings by OSU College of Engineering researcher John Labram and graduate student Cinthya Trujillo Herrera were published today in Applied Physics Letters. Previous attempts to build a human-eye type of device, called a retinomorphic sensor, have relied on software or complex hardware, said Labram, assistant professor of electrical engineering and computer science. But the new sensor’s operation is part of its fundamental design, using ultrathin layers of perovskite semiconductors – widely studied in recent years for their solar energy potential – that change from strong electrical insulators to strong conductors when placed in light. “You can think of it as a single pixel doing something that would currently require a microprocessor,” said Labram, who is leading the research effort with support from the National Science Foundation."</em> <a href="https://today.oregonstate.edu/news/breakthrough-optical-sensor-mimics-human-eye-key-step-toward-better-artificial-intelligence">[...]</a>

However, additive manufacturing also generates defects in the microstructure of a finished part, limiting its role to the fabrication of ductwork, interior components and other non-critical parts. Additive manufacturing of safety-regulated parts will help the industry achieve its aspirations for efficient and stable supply chain management, as well as fuel savings and emissions reductions that accompany a lighter aircraft. Sun’s team and collaborators have discovered why structural defects occur during the additive manufacture of parts made from a high-strength, light-weight titanium alloy widely used in aerospace applications.

Spacecraft launched from Earth need to be light, but still have the right amount of fuel to see them achieve orbit.

Alloys help aluminium become harder via precipitation strengthening, but the radiation encountered in space can dissolve the hardening precipitates with potentially disastrous and fatal consequences for astronauts."</em> <a href="https://www.hud.ac.uk/news/2020/december/alloy-research-manned-space-missions-benefits/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.kyushu-u.ac.jp/en/researches/view/186">Molecules convert visible light into ultraviolet light with record efficiency</a></h2>

<p><em>"Newly developed molecular system makes possible the efficient conversion of even weak visible light from sunlight and indoor LEDs into ultraviolet light Light-powered processes from hydrogen production to air purification could see a boost in performance under ambient light thanks to a new material system that can directly convert visible light into ultraviolet light with an efficiency that doubles previous records. Developed by researchers at Kyushu University, the system achieves a light upconversion efficiency of 20% at high intensities and maintains relatively high performance even under weak light, making it promising for harnessing visible light already around us to drive applications requiring high-energy ultraviolet light. While people often try to avoid ultraviolet light because of the damage it can do to skin, Nobuhiro Yanai, associate professor of Kyushu University’s Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, has been searching for ways to increase the number of these high-energy rays to power photocatalysts that enable a variety of useful reactions from producing hydrogen for use in fuel-cell vehicles to purifying indoor environments. “Although dedicated light sources such as ultraviolet LEDs can be used to drive these reactions, they consume energy and increase complexity,” explains Yanai. “Instead, a much more elegant solution is to harvest the sunlight and indoor ambient light that is already all around us.” However, these ambient light sources generally have a large portion of their energy in the lower-energy visible region and only a fraction of it in the ultraviolet, so researchers have been searching for ways to directly convert visible light with wavelengths longer than 400 nm into higher-energy ultraviolet light. To do this, the research team led by Yanai and Nobuo Kimizuka have been focusing on a process called triplet-triplet annihilation."</em> <a href="https://www.kyushu-u.ac.jp/en/researches/view/186">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scientists reveal 'flat band' behavior in 2D 'bitriangular' lattice of germanium, confirming earlier theoretical prediction Scientists have recently revealed, both theoretically and experimentally, that germanium atoms can arrange themselves into a 2D "bitriangular" lattice on zirconium diboride thin films grown on germanium single crystals to form a "flat band material" with an embedded "kagome" lattice. The result provides experimental support to a theoretical prediction of flat bands emerging from trivial atomic geometry and indicates the possibility of their existence in many more materials. The human mind is naturally drawn to objects that possess symmetry; in fact, the notion of beauty is often conflated with symmetry. In nature, nothing epitomizes symmetry more than crystals. Since their discovery, crystals have attracted a great deal of attention not only by their unique "symmetrical" aesthetic appeal but also by their unique properties. One of these properties is the behavior of electrons inside a crystal."</em> <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-12/jaio-eff120420.php">[...]</a>

<p><em>"New control strategy dynamically changes transmitter currents for optimal wireless charging in moving devices, such as robots and electric cars Scientists at Incheon National University, Korea, develop a control strategy that allows for transferring power wirelessly through multiple transmitter coils with maximum efficiency. Unlike conventional approaches in which only the transmitter closer to the receiver is active, this novel method dispatches the optimal amount of current to each transmitter, depending on the degree of coupling with the receiver. This technique will help surpass the hurdles of wired charging in electric vehicles and industrial robots. Wireless power transfer has proven to be quite useful in electronic devices such as medical implants and smartphones. In most cases, this is done by aligning or “coupling” two separate coils of wire (transmitter Tx and receiver Rx). The electrical current circulating in the Tx coil then creates a magnetic field that transfers energy to the Rx coil."</em> <a href="https://incheonnatu.medium.com/no-strings-attached-maximizing-wireless-charging-efficiency-with-multiple-transmitters-8426fc35de01">[...]</a>

In the wake of this progress, another miniature technology has been gaining steam: integrated photonics. Photons, which are the quantum particles of light, have some advantages over electrons, the namesakes of electronics. For some applications, photons offer faster and more accurate information transfer and use less power than electrons. And because on-chip photonics are largely built using the same technology created for the electronics industry, they carry the promise of integrating electronics and photonics on the same chip. Tiny photonic chips have already been adopted in many places, including telecommunications networks (think fiber optic internet) and large data centers (think interfacing fiber-optics with electronics)."</em> <a href="https://jqi.umd.edu/news/enhanced-frequency-doubling-adds-photonics-toolkit">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Building on their newfound ability to induce molecules in ultracold gases to interact with each other over long distances, JILA researchers have used an electric “knob” to influence molecular collisions and dramatically raise or lower chemical reaction rates. These super-chilly gases follow the seemingly counterintuitive rules of quantum mechanics, featuring exact units, or quanta, of energy and often-exotic motions. Thus, the ability to control chemical reactions in stable quantum gases could enable the design of novel chemicals and gases, new platforms for quantum computers using molecules as information-rich qubits (quantum bits), and new tools for precision measurement such as molecular clocks. The advance is described in the Dec. 11 issue of Science. JILA is jointly operated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the University of Colorado Boulder. “The molecular collisions in our experiment are very quantum mechanical, with their trajectories all quantized in terms of the way in which they can approach each other,” NIST/JILA Fellow Jun Ye said."</em> <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2020/12/jilas-electric-knob-tunes-chemical-reaction-rates-quantum-gas">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers have found a way to protect highly fragile quantum systems from noise, which could aid in the design and development of new quantum devices, such as ultra-powerful quantum computers. The researchers, from the University of Cambridge, have shown that microscopic particles can remain intrinsically linked, or entangled, over long distances even if there are random disruptions between them. Using the mathematics of quantum theory, they discovered a simple setup where entangled particles can be prepared and stabilised even in the presence of noise by taking advantage of a previously unknown symmetry in quantum systems. Their results, reported in the journal Physical Review Letters, open a new window into the mysterious quantum world that could revolutionise future technology by preserving quantum effects in noisy environments, which is the single biggest hurdle for developing such technology. Harnessing this capability will be at the heart of ultrafast quantum computers. Quantum systems are built on the peculiar behaviour of particles at the atomic level and could revolutionise the way that complex calculations are performed."</em> <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/hidden-symmetry-could-be-key-to-more-robust-quantum-systems-researchers-find">[...]</a>
