<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1913, o matemático húngaro <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s">Paul Erdös</a>. Ele foi um dos principais especialistas em matemática do século XX e foi pioneiro nos campos da teoria dos números e da combinatória. O tipo de matemática em que ele trabalhava era problemas simples de entender, mas notoriamente difíceis de resolver. Aos 20 anos, ele descobriu uma prova para um teorema clássico da teoria dos números que afirma que há sempre pelo menos um número primo entre qualquer número inteiro positivo e seu dobro. Nos anos 30, ele estudou na Inglaterra e mudou-se para os EUA no final dos anos 30, quando suas origens judaicas tornaram impossível o retorno à Hungria. Afectado pelo McCarthyism na década de 1950, ele passou boa parte dos próximos dez anos em Israel. Onde escreveu  centenas de artigos que fizeram dele um dos matemáticos mais prolíficos da história.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1916, o bioquímico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_B._Anfinsen">Christian B. Anfinsen</a>. Ele recebeu (conjuntamente com Stanford Moore e William H. Stein) o Prémio Nobel de Química de 1972 por pesquisas sobre a forma e a estrutura primária da ribonuclease (a enzima que hidrolisa o RNA). A ribonuclease é composta por uma cadeia de peptídeo único (uma molécula que consiste em duas ou mais moléculas de aminoácidos unidas por uma ligação peptídica) dobrada numa esfera unida por quatro ligações dissulfureto. Estas ligações podem ser quebradas para que a enzima fique desnaturada (colapsando), perdendo todas as suas propriedades enzimáticas. Anfinsen descobriu que a sua forma e, consequentemente, seu poder enzimático poderiam ser restaurados e concluiu que a ribonuclease deve reter todas as informações sobre a sua configuração dentro dos seus aminoácidos.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1973, o cientista da computação e empreendedor norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Page">Larry Page</a>. Ele era estudante de graduação quando co-fundou a Google, Inc. com Sergey Brin, enquanto trabalhava no mesmo doutoramento. Eles desenvolveram as suas ideias para o mecanismo de busca na época e fundaram a empresa em 1998, com apoio financeiro de investidores, familiares e amigos. Page era o presidente de produtos da empresa. O sucesso foi tão grande que, em 19 de Agosto de 2004, a empresa fez uma oferta pública inicial de acções (IPO) para aumentar o capital para crescer ainda mais. Eventualmente, o seu valor excedeu o de Disney, McDonals e General Motors juntos.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. É apresentado o livro "SIGNAL" da Texas assim como as revistas HackSpace 29 e MagPI 92 de Abril e as revistas newelectronics de 10 e 24 de Março.</p>

<h2><a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4242.html">STMicroelectronics Introduces Standalone VBUS-Powered Controller for 5V USB-C Charging Applications</a></h2>

<p><em>"The STUSB4500L from STMicroelectronics is a small-footprint addition to the Company’s USB-C controller IC family designed and certified for pure 5V sink-only applications. All mandatory features to use the USB-C connector as a 5V universal power plug are integrated, allowing designers to implement USB-C charging solutions quickly and easily without studying the standard or writing code. USB-C is rapidly becoming established as a replacement for Micro-B or Mini-B plugs, for both power and data connections, as it offers the advantages of reversible orientation and greater robustness — up to 10,000 connect/disconnect cycles. ST’s new USB-C controller IC is a stand-alone, plug-and-play interface product, targeting low-voltage applications such as Bluetooth speakers, computer accessories, Wi-Fi access points, point-of-sale equipment, LED lighting, and USB dongles. It can also be used for powering equipment such as single-board computers and hardware development kits. The controller IC runs without additional code and requires no external support from the microcontroller, which eases adoption of the USB-C connector standard by saving time-consuming design work."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4242.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"We are one of several teams who recognized the challenges faced by Italian physicians, and are working to find a solution to the anticipated global lack of ventilators. In the US alone, the COVID-19 pandemic may cause ventilator shortages on the order of 300,000-700,000 units (CDC Pandemic Response Plans). These could present on a national scale within weeks, and are already being felt in certain areas. An increase in conventional ventilator production is very likely to fall short and with significant associated cost (paywall warning). Almost every bed in a hospital has a manual resuscitator (Ambu-Bag) nearby, available in the event of a rapid response or code where healthcare workers maintain oxygenation by squeezing the bag. Automating this appears to be the simplest strategy that satisfies the need for low-cost mechanical ventilation, with the ability to be rapidly manufactured in large quantities."</em> <a href="https://e-vent.mit.edu/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Eight and a half years into its grand tour of the solar system, NASA’s Voyager 2 spacecraft was ready for another encounter. It was Jan. 24, 1986, and soon it would meet the mysterious seventh planet, icy-cold Uranus. Over the next few hours, Voyager 2 flew within 50,600 miles (81,433 kilometers) of Uranus’ cloud tops, collecting data that revealed two new rings, 11 new moons and temperatures below minus 353 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 214 degrees Celsius). The dataset is still the only up-close measurements we have ever made of the planet. Three decades later, scientists reinspecting that data found one more secret. Unbeknownst to the entire space physics community, 34 years ago Voyager 2 flew through a plasmoid, a giant magnetic bubble that may have been whisking Uranus’s atmosphere out to space."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020/revisiting-decades-old-voyager-2-data-scientists-find-one-more-secret">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/p4234.html">STMicroelectronics Powers Next-Generation Computer-Vision Applications with High-Performance Global-Shutter Image Sensors</a></h2>

<p><em>"STMicroelectronics (NYSE: STM), a global semiconductor leader serving customers across the spectrum of electronics applications, is enabling the next generation of smart computer-vision applications with new high-speed image sensors that use “global shutter” – the preferred mode for capturing distortion-free images when the scene is moving or when near-infrared illumination is needed. ST’s advanced image-sensor process technologies enable class-leading pixel size while offering both high sensitivity and low crosstalk. The combination of silicon process innovation and advanced pixel architecture allows a smaller sensor pixel array on the top die, while keeping more silicon area on the bottom die to increase digital-processing capabilities and features. The new sensors are the VD55G0 with 640 x 600 pixels and the VD56G3 with 1.5 Mpixels (1124 x 1364). Measuring 2.6mm x 2.5mm and 3.6mm x 4.3mm, respectively, VD55G0 and VD56G3 are the smallest on the market in relation to resolution. Low pixel-to-pixel crosstalk at all wavelengths, specifically near-infrared, ensures high contrast for superior image clarity."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/p4234.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/aboutus/newsroom.html/pr_502592184">Industry’s Smallest LiDAR ICs by Maxim Integrated Offer More Than 2x Higher Bandwidth for Faster Self-Driving Cars</a></h2>

<p><em>"Tiny, high-bandwidth transimpedance amplifier and high-speed comparator add 32 additional channels to a LiDAR module with the same overall solution size Designers of automotive self-driving systems can now enable higher-speed autonomous driving through the industry's fastest and smallest Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) ICs from Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (NASDAQ: MXIM). Compared to the closest competitive solution, the MAX40026 high-speed comparator and the MAX40660/MAX40661 high-bandwidth transimpedance amplifiers enable 10mph (15km/h) faster autonomous driving at highway speeds by providing more than 2x higher bandwidth and accommodating 32 additional channels (128 vs. 96) to a LiDAR module within the same module size. With automotive self-driving systems evolving from 35mph to 65mph and beyond, LiDAR sensors are playing an increasing role in the fusion of vehicle sensors for their ability to provide accurate distance measurement of objects. With more than twice the bandwidth and the ability to accommodate 33 percent more channels within the same LiDAR module size compared to the closest competitor, the MAX40660/MAX40661 transimpedance amplifiers (TIAs) provide optical receiver designers with higher-resolution images that enable faster autonomous driving systems. The system size of the MAX40026 high-speed comparator plus the MAX40660/1 TIAs is 5mm2 smaller than the closest competitive solution, which allows developers to fit far more channels into space-constrained vehicle platforms. These ICs meet the stringent safety requirements of the automotive industry with AEC-Q100 qualification, enhanced electrostatic discharge (ESD) performance and failure modes, effects and diagnostic analysis (FMEDA) to support ISO 26262 certification at the system level."</em> <a href="https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/aboutus/newsroom.html/pr_502592184">[...]</a>

<p><em>"SpaceX now licensed to deploy 1 million of what Musk calls "UFOs on a stick." SpaceX has received government approval to deploy up to 1 million user terminals in the United States for its Starlink satellite-broadband constellation. SpaceX asked the Federal Communications Commission for the license in February 2019, and the FCC announced its approval in a public notice last week. The FCC approval is for "a blanket license for the operation of up to 1,000,000 fixed earth stations that will communicate with [SpaceX's] non-geostationary orbit satellite system." The license is good for 15 years. As SpaceX's application said, the earth stations are "user terminals [that] employ advanced phased-array beam-forming and digital-processing technologies to make highly efficient use of Ku-band spectrum resources by supporting highly directive, steered antenna beams that track the system's low-Earth orbit satellites.""</em> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/03/spacex-gets-fcc-license-for-1-million-satellite-broadband-user-terminals/">[...]</a>

They enable us to unravel the properties of future materials, test the quality of automotive paint and screen envelopes. But generating these waves is still a challenge. A team at Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR), TU Dresden and the University of Konstanz has now made significant progress. The researchers have developed a germanium component that generates short terahertz pulses with an advantageous property: the pulses have an extreme broadband spectrum and thus deliver many different terahertz frequencies at the same time. As it has been possible to manufacture the component employing methods already used in the semiconductor industry, the development promises a broad range of applications in research and technology, as the team reports in the journal Light: Science &amp; Applications (DOI: 10.1038/s41377-020-0265-4)."</em> <a href="https://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pNid=99&amp;pOid=60476">[...]</a>

While disks orbiting the most compact binary star systems share very nearly the same plane, disks encircling wide binaries have orbital planes that are severely tilted. These systems can teach us about planet formation in complex environments. In the last two decades, thousands of planets have been found orbiting stars other than our Sun. Some of these planets orbit two stars, just like Luke Skywalker’s home Tatooine. Planets are born in protoplanetary disks – we now have wonderful observations of these thanks to ALMA – but most of the disks studied so far orbit single stars."</em> <a href="https://www.almaobservatory.org/en/press-release/the-strange-orbits-of-tatooine-planetary-disks/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"New approach featured on the front cover of the latest issue of Advanced Optical Materials. Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) – the light-based equivalent of electronic ICs – carry signals via visible and infrared light. Optical materials with adjustable refractive index are essential for reconfigurable PICs as they allow for more accurate manipulation of light passing through the materials, leading to better PIC performance. Current programmable PIC concepts suffer from issues such as volatility and/or high optical signal losses – both of which negatively affect a material’s ability to keep its programmed state. Using hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H), a material used in thin-film silicon solar cells, and the associated Staebler-Wronski effect (SWE), which describes how the optical properties of a-Si:H can be changed via light exposure or heating, researchers at Eindhoven University of Technology have designed a new PIC fabrication process that addresses the shortfalls of current techniques and could lead to the emergence of universal programmable PICs.

The metro cities all around the world are facing a lot of problem because of the increasing population, which is resulting in an exponential pollution rise, which is a very serious problem and needs immediate attention. But the problem is that there is no proper monitoring device for these Urban environments, so we are unable to get any reliable data. Even if there are devices to monitor the conditions, they are in limited number due to the current cost - to - reliability and accuracy count. So, What's the Solution? The SparkUQM - designed specifically for urban environments."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/dhairya-parikh/sparkuqm-an-ai-powered-urban-quality-monitoring-system-0c2ee2">[...]</a>

I have created an electronics project named Remote Lamp two years ago, as my new room lighting system with adjustable RGB, LEDs, and some joyful features controlled by a TV remote control. However, I decided to improve the mentioned project since it has irritating redundant wiring due to the LCD screen connections and deficiencies in the user interface due to the TV remote control. So, I took my nascent idea of remote control of my room lighting system and turned it into a mobile remote lighting system controlled by an Android application developed by me. And, to get rid of the redundant wiring and add more features with limited pins on Arduino Nano, I designed a PCB (Printed Circuit Board) named Mobile Remote Lamp with Weather Station V2.0, which includes all built-in component connections.
