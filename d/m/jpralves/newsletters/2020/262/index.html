<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1909, o inventor e físico americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_H._Land">Edwin H. Land</a>. Conhecido por fundar a Polaroid, o seu processo de uma fase para o desenvolvimento e impressão de fotografias foi a maior inovação em fotografia desde a introdução do filme em rolo. Ele demonstrou pela primeira vez a Polaroid Land Camera em 1947, que produzia impressões totalmente desenvolvidas em apenas 60 segundos. Land também aplicou o nome Polaroid ao filtro de polarização da luz que ele tinha inventado incorporando cristais adequados numa folha de plástico, amplamente conhecida pelo seu uso nas lentes dos óculos de sol. Os seus outros projectos incluíam raios-X instantâneos, projector de filmes em 3D entre as mais de 500 patentes que ele possuía.</p>

<p>E chegamos ao 5º aniversário da newsletter do altLab. Com este número são 262 semanas consecutivas a trazer noticias e projectos que vão aparecendo na Internet e que merecem ser referidos. Esta experiência tem sido profundamente enriquecedora para mim, não só pelo conhecimento que adquiro semanalmente ao deambular pela Internet em busca de novidades e de projecto interessantes para apresentar, como também por pode-lo partilhar com todos, criando na newsletter um índice para coisas interessantes que andam por ai.</p>

<p>O trabalho para criar a newsletter subdivide-se em dois momentos. Num primeiro momento que ocorre ao longo de toda a semana é feita a marcação de páginas/artigos que são potenciais candidatos a incluir, isto envolve um esforço nunca inferior a 1 hora por dia. Depois, no dia da newsletter é feito o trabalho de ler, seleccionar e resumir todos os artigos a incluir, este trabalho é de cerca de 4 a 5 horas. Portanto, para que esta newsletter chegue todas as semanas existe um esforço de cerca de 12 horas semanais da minha parte para a criar. As ferramentas que eu uso são relativamente rudimentares, "feedly" para marcar os artigos que aparecem nos diversos feed de RSS que tenho subscrito (cerca de 1000), depois usando o browser abro os links para as páginas, dou uma leitura, por vezes vou atrás da fonte do artigo e depois gravo a imagem de apresentação, o link para o vídeo e o texto assim como o link e titulo para a página. Isto fica tudo num ficheiro de texto que posteriormente é processado por um script de Python que faz toda a formatação e normalização dos textos e imagens produzindo um ficheiro final para a newsletter. A edição das imagens é feita com o GIMP e tudo isto é feito numa máquina com Linux Fedora.</p>

<p>Sei que existem diversas dificuldades em aceder à newsletter, havendo momentos em que a mesma se encontra inacessível ou apresenta imagens quebradas. Iremos num futuro muito próximo mudar a localização do site do altLab para outro servidor com mais capacidade e esperemos que nessa altura esses problemas fiquem resolvidos.</p>

<p>Só me resta agradecer o apoio que tenho de todos e enquanto me for possível continuarei com esta tarefa. E que venham mais 5!</p>

<p>E nesta semana que passou a Starlink explicou a forma como vai fazer para que a rede gigante de satélites que está a colocar em órbita não afecte os sistemas de observação astronómica. Essa operação passa por alterar a maneira como os satélites voam para sua altitude operacional, para que eles voem com os painéis numa orientação em direcção ao Sol. Como se trata de uma alteração que pode ser feita em Software, os engenheiros já estão a trabalhar nessa alteração.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos assim como projetos de maker. É apresentado o ebook Raspberry Pi Camera Guide que aborda a nova câmara do Raspberry PI lançada a semana passada.</p>

<p><em>"SpaceX is launching Starlink to provide high-speed, low-latency broadband connectivity across the globe, including to locations where internet has traditionally been too expensive, unreliable, or entirely unavailable. We also firmly believe in the importance of a natural night sky for all of us to enjoy, which is why we have been working with leading astronomers around the world to better understand the specifics of their observations and engineering changes we can make to reduce satellite brightness. Our goals include: Making the satellites generally invisible to the naked eye within a week of launch. We're doing this by changing the way the satellites fly to their operational altitude, so that they fly with the satellite knife-edge to the Sun. We are working on implementing this as soon as possible for all satellites since it is a software change. Minimizing Starlink's impact on astronomy by darkening satellites so they do not saturate observatory detectors."</em> <a href="https://www.spacex.com/news/2020/04/28/starlink-update">[...]</a>

<p><em>"STMicroelectronics’ SRK1000A and SRK1000B secondary-side synchronous-rectification (SR) controllers for flyback converters, featuring high efficiency and low power consumption, introduce a new, more affordable and smaller-footprint option for battery chargers, quick chargers, adapters, and USB power-delivery outlets. Designed for fast turn-on with minimum delay, and with innovative adaptive turn-off logic, the devices maximize synchronous-rectification MOSFET conduction time and minimize the effects of parasitic inductance in the circuit without the need to add external components, leading to greatly improved system efficiency and a reduced bill of materials. The SRK1000A and SRK1000B are both able to manage a wide range of flyback controllers including quasi-resonant (QR) and mixed CCM/DCM fixed frequency operation up to 300kHz, simplifying system design. Both devices allow programmable blanking time after turn-on (TON), via resistor selection, to prevent noise from inducing spurious behavior. The SRK1000A has a 2μs fixed blanking time after turn-off (TOFF), while the corresponding value for the SRK1000B is 3μs. The devices both offer an efficient low power mode at light load, entering a low-consumption sleep mode when synchronous rectification is no longer beneficial."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4254.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The STMicroelectronics L99UDL01 automotive universal door-lock IC integrates six MOSFET half-bridge outputs and two half-bridge gate drivers with protection and diagnostic functions that enhance safety, simplify design, and save space. As a complete centralized solution for electronically driving car locks from a body-control module (BCM), the L99UDL01 replaces multiple individual motor drivers and associated analog and passive components while providing more sophisticated functionality. The IC integrates a unique safety feature that overrides normal operation in the event of an accident to help ensure that first responders will have access to the vehicle. Adding further value are PWM output-current regulation and high-level diagnostics capable of detecting over current, open load, short to battery, and short to ground. The load-integrity checks can be completed without actuating the load. The six integrated MOSFET half bridges can be connected independently or as two channels containing up to three half bridges in parallel to share higher-current loads."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4246.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA, President: Hiroshi Yamakawa), the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT, President: Hideyuki Tokuda) and Sony Computer Science Laboratories, Inc. (Sony CSL, President and CEO: Hiroaki Kitano) announced today that they were successful in establishing a bidirectional laser communication link between SOLISS (Small Optical Link for International Space Station), installed in the Exposed Facility of the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) "Kibo" of the International Space Station (ISS) and the optical ground station for satellite communications (hereinafter, optical ground station)*1 of NICT, and in transmitting high-definition (HD) image data via Ethernet. This marks the first time in the world that bidirectional symmetric Ethernet links have been established by using laser communication devices designed for small satellites. The SOLISS system was installed on the Kibo’s exposed facility on the ISS in September 2019. Since then, in order to establish a bidirectional laser communication link between the on-board system and the optical ground station, communication tests have been conducted about once a week, weather permitting, while making adjustments to various parameters. As a result, on October 25, 2019, an optical downlink (orientation control), a fine pointing control from SOLISS to the optical ground station was successfully established, and on March 5, 2020, bidirectional laser communication link with the optical ground station using a laser beam (with a wavelength of 1.5 µm) was successfully established. Furthermore, on March 11, HD images were successfully received at the optical ground station from SOLISS via 100 Mbps Ethernet."</em> <a href="https://global.jaxa.jp/press/2020/04/20200423-1_e.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A discovery that long eluded physicists has been detected in a laboratory at Princeton. A team of physicists detected superconducting currents — the flow of electrons without wasting energy — along the exterior edge of a superconducting material. The finding was published May 1 in the journal Science. The superconductor that the researchers studied is also a topological semi-metal, a material that comes with its own unusual electronic properties. The finding suggests ways to unlock a new era of “topological superconductivity” that could have value for quantum computing. “To our knowledge, this is the first observation of an edge supercurrent in any superconductor,” said Nai Phuan Ong, Princeton’s Eugene Higgins Professor of Physics and the senior author on the study."</em> <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/news/2020/05/01/new-princeton-study-takes-superconductivity-edge">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Engineers have demonstrated a practical way to use magnetism to transmit electricity wirelessly to recharge electric cars, robots or even drones. The technology could be scaled up to power electric cars as they drive over highways, robots on factory floors and drones hovering over rooftops. Stanford engineers have taken a big step toward making it practical for electric cars to recharge as they speed along futuristic highways built to “refuel” vehicles wirelessly. Although wireless charging pads already exist for smartphones, they only work if the phone is sitting still. For cars, that would be just as inconvenient as the current practice of plugging them in for an hour or two at charging stations. Three years ago, Stanford electrical engineer Shanhui Fan and Sid Assawaworrarit, a graduate student in his lab, built the first system that could wirelessly recharge objects in motion."</em> <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2020/05/04/wirelessly-charging-electric-cars-drive/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Research opens door to low-heat, low-energy, fast internet Microchips without electrons will allow for the invention of data processing systems that don't overheat, have low energy costs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This foundational work will help scientists invent systems to achieve those aims. Scientists in Australia and Europe have taken an important step towards removing ‘hot’ electrons from the data chips that are a driving force in global telecommunications. Researchers from the University of Sydney Nano Institute and Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light say that chips using light and sound, rather than electricity, will be important for the development of future tech, such as high-speed internet as well as radar and sensor technology. This will require the low-heat, fast transmission of information. “As demand for high bandwidth information systems increase, we want to get ahead of the curve to ensure we can invent devices that don’t overheat, have low energy costs and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases,” said Dr Moritz Merklein from the Eggleton Research Group in the School of Physics and Sydney Nano."</em> <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2020/05/07/light-sound-action-extending-life-acoustic-waves-on-phonon-photonic-microchips.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"ICFO researchers report on a new method to obtain high color purity 3D objects with the use of a new class of nanoparticles. Selective powder sintering for 3D printing has recently become an increasingly affordable solution for manufacturing made-to-order elements of almost any shape or geometry. This technique involves heating a bed of powder (such as polyamide, PA12) to just below its melting point, using an IR light source to selectively melt a cross section of the powder, then adding more powder and repeating to form a 3D object. To reduce costs and increase printing speed, a photothermal sensitizer is often added to the powders. Typically carbon-based, with a strong broadband absorption, adding these sensitizers to the polymer powders increases the conversion of incident light to heat, which means greater print speeds. However, carbon-based sensitizers can only produce black or gray objects."</em> <a href="https://www.icfo.eu/newsroom/news/article/4719">[...]</a>

Measuring stiffness Graphene is a 2D material, but has 3D properties such as its stiffness in the ‘out-of-plane’ direction, perpendicular to the plane of the graphene sheets. The behaviour of π electrons within multilayer graphene determine its out-of-plane stiffness. In this study, the researchers found that when bilayer graphene is compressed out-of-plane, some π electrons are ‘squeezed’ through the graphene planes, which are impenetrable to small molecules such as water. This response makes the material softer and much easier to compress."</em> <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/media/news/2020/se/new-study-reveals-unexpected-softness-of-bilayer-graphene.html">[...]</a>

"With this new scale law uncovering the underlying physics behind the collective thermal emission behavior of metamaterials, researchers could easily utilize existing design and optimization tools to achieve desired thermal emission properties from metamaterials, instead of blindly searching for the best solution through mapping the entire design space," Li said. Thermal emission refers to the type of light a material emits. For example, humans emit infrared light, while glowing hot metal emits visible light."</em> <a href="https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/news/2020/05/new-law-for-metamaterials.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The huge detectors providing a window to the world’s tiniest particles are set for a $153 million upgrade, and a team of Purdue University scientists will play a key role — continuing the university’s decades-long legacy with the historic experiments at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, or CERN. Over the next five years, the international collaboration will improve by tenfold the sensitivity of the Compact Muon Solenoid, or CMS, detector, and prepare it to endure radiation levels equivalent to the core of a nuclear reactor when CERN increases the intensity of the proton beams in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) — the largest and most powerful particle accelerator in the world. “The levels of radiation the detectors will face in this next phase of experiments presents a real challenge. We have to find materials that will survive this exposure for 10 years without turning to dust,” said Matthew Jones, the Purdue professor of physics and astronomy who is a principal investigator on the National Science Foundation-funded project led by Cornell University. “We are really at the bleeding edge, and the technological advances from this project will inform fields spanning space exploration, computer science and optics. But our goal is to understand the nature of the fundamental particles from which our world is built.” From smashing particles at near the speed of light to the discovery of the Higgs particle and celebration of the Nobel Prize that followed, Purdue researchers have persistently pursued the science alongside their international colleagues at CERN."</em> <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2020/Q2/scientists-at-the-bleeding-edge-with-upgrade-to-cms-detector.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Watson team uses new lattice material to create models that regain shape after being crushed Pu Zhang likes to compare his team’s research on liquid metals to the Terminator — specifically 1991’s Terminator 2: Judgment Day, in which a killer robot sent from a grim future can transform into anyone and anything in pursuit of its human prey. When told maybe that’s not the best comparison, Zhang laughed and made a confession: “To be honest, I’ve never watched that movie!” Zhang — an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at the Thomas J. Watson School of Engineering and Applied Science — has much more benign plans for his latest study, which will be published in the May issue of the journal Additive Manufacturing. Working with PhD students Fanghang Deng and Quang-Kha Nguyen, Zhang developed what he calls “the first liquid metal lattice in the world,” which is made from Field’s alloy. The mix of bismuth, indium and tin — named after its inventor, Simon Quellen Field — becomes liquid at the relatively low melting point of 62°C (144°F). Field’s alloy is currently used as a liquid-metal coolant in nuclear engineering, among other applications, but the Watson team demonstrates other potential applications. They combined the metal lattice material with a rubber shell through a hybrid manufacturing process."</em> <a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/news/story/2371/liquid-metal-research-invokes-images-of-terminator-film-but-much-friendlier">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A team of astronomers from the European Southern Observatory (ESO) and other institutes has discovered a black hole lying just 1000 light-years from Earth. The black hole is closer to our Solar System than any other found to date and forms part of a triple system that can be seen with the naked eye. The team found evidence for the invisible object by tracking its two companion stars using the MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope at ESO’s La Silla Observatory in Chile. They say this system could just be the tip of the iceberg, as many more similar black holes could be found in the future. "We were totally surprised when we realised that this is the first stellar system with a black hole that can be seen with the unaided eye,” says Petr Hadrava, Emeritus Scientist at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic in Prague and co-author of the research. Located in the constellation of Telescopium, the system is so close to us that its stars can be viewed from the southern hemisphere on a dark, clear night without binoculars or a telescope."</em> <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso2007/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Just about everyone has had the experience of blinking while having their picture taken. The camera clicks, your eyes shut, and by the time they open again, the photo is ruined. A new ultrafast camera developed at Caltech, were it aimed at your lovely face, could also capture you looking like a dunce with your eyes shut, except instead of taking just one picture in the time it takes you to blink, it could take trillions of pictures. The new camera developed in the lab of Lihong Wang, Bren Professor of Medical Engineering and Electrical Engineering in the Andrew and Peggy Cherng Department of Medical Engineering, is capable of taking as many as 70 trillion frames per second. That is fast enough to see waves of light traveling and the fluorescent decay of molecules. The camera technology, which Wang calls compressed ultrafast spectral photography (CUSP), is similar in some respects to previous fast cameras he has built, such as his phase-sensitive compressed ultrafast photography, or pCUP, device, which can take 1 trillion frames per second of transparent objects and phenomena."</em> <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/new-ultrafast-camera-takes-70-trillion-pictures-second">[...]</a>

Also referred to as numerically controlled oscillators (NCO), a DDS contains a lookup table for the data values of a sinusoid which takes in a given phase value and outputs the appropriate data/magnitude value for the sinusoid. This input value determines the frequency of the output waveform in that the smaller the value is, the slower the DDS steps through the sinusoid lookup table and the output waveform is lower in frequency.
