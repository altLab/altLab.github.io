<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1777, o matemático alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss">Carl Friedrich Gauss</a>. Ele foi responsável pela transformação de quase todas as áreas da matemática, para as quais o seu talento mostrou-se desde muito cedo. Pelas suas contribuições à teoria do magnetismo e da electricidade, uma unidade de campo magnético foi denominada de gauss. Ele criou o método dos mínimos quadrados na estatística, e sua curva de erro gaussiana permanece bem conhecida. Ele antecipou o sistema SI na sua proposta de que as unidades físicas deveriam basear-se em algumas unidades absolutas, como comprimento, massa e tempo. Em astronomia, ele calculou as órbitas dos pequenos planetas Ceres e Pallas por um novo método. Ele inventou o heliotrópio para determinação trigonométrica da forma da Terra. Com Wilhelm Weber, ele desenvolveu um telégrafo electromagnético e dois magnetómetros.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1904 o matemático norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stibitz">George Robert Stibitz</a>. Foi considerado por muitos como o "pai do computador digital moderno". Enquanto trabalhava como matemático de pesquisa nos Laboratórios Bell Telephone, em Nova York, Stibitz trabalhou no equipamento de comutação de relé usado nas redes telefónicas. Em 1937, Stibitz, cientista do Bell Laboratories, construiu uma máquina digital baseada em relés, lâmpadas de lanterna e tiras de metal cortadas de latas. Ele o chamou de "Modelo K" porque a maior parte foi construída na sua mesa da cozinha. Ele trabalhou com o princípio de que, se dois relés fossem activados, eles causariam a activação de um terceiro, onde esse terceiro relé representaria a soma da operação. Além disso, em 1940, ele fez uma demonstração da primeira operação remota de um computador.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1916 o matemático, engenheiro electrotécnico e criptógrafo norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon">Claude Shannon</a>. Conhecido como "o pai da teoria da informação". Shannon é conhecido por ter fundado a teoria da informação com um artigo de referência, "Uma teoria matemática da comunicação", que ele publicou em 1948. Ele também é creditado por ter fundado a teoria do desenho de computadores digitais e de circuitos digitais em 1937, quando, como estudante de mestrado de 21 anos no Instituto de Tecnologia de Massachusetts (MIT), escreveu sua tese demonstrando que as aplicações eléctricas da álgebra booleana poderia construir e resolver qualquer relacionamento numérico lógico. Shannon contribuiu para o campo da cripto-análise para defesa nacional durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial, incluindo seu trabalho básico sobre decifrar códigos e telecomunicações seguras.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que o asteróide 1998 OR2 passou muito perto da Terra, a cerca de 6.3 milhões de quilómetros que corresponde a cerca de mais de 16 vezes a distância à Lua. Este corpo celeste tem cerca de 2 quilómetros de diâmetro e foi descoberto em Julho de 1998 pelo o Jet Propulsion Lab da NASA.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou foi lançada a distribuição Fedora 32. As três edições - Workstation, Server e CoreOS - foram lançadas em simultâneo e trazem como grandes novidades o refrescamento das principais linguagens de programação e bibliotecas de sistema, incluindo o GCC 10, o Ruby 2.7 e o Python 3.8. Foi igualmente feito um esforço para que as bibliotecas de Python 2 e as suas dependências sejam removidas.</p>

<p>E nesta semana que passou também foram comemorados os 30 anos do Hubble. As imagens icónicas e avanços científicos do Telescópio Espacial Hubble da NASA / ESA redefiniram nossa visão do Universo. A 24 de Abril de 1990, o Telescópio Espacial Hubble foi lançado no Space Shuttle Discovery, junto com uma equipa de cinco astronautas. Implantado na órbita baixa da Terra um dia depois, o telescópio abriu nossos olhos para o cosmos e transformou nosso conhecimento colectivo do Universo.</p>

<p>Também esta semana foi lançada uma nova câmara para o Raspberry PI. A câmara de alta qualidade de 12.3 megapixels, custa cerca de 50€. A principal novidade, além do aumento de qualidade é a possibilidade de ser acoplado de forma simples um conjunto de lentes intercambiáveis. Esta câmara vem equipada com o sensor IMX477 da Sony.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos artigos científicos assim como projetos de maker. São apresentadas a revista neweletronics de 28 de Abril e a MagPI nº93 de Maio de 2020.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7649">Asteroid 1998 OR2 to Safely Fly Past Earth This Week</a></h2>

<p><em>"A large near-Earth asteroid will safely pass by our planet on Wednesday morning, providing astronomers with an exceptional opportunity to study the 1.5-mile-wide (2-kilometer-wide) object in great detail. The asteroid, called 1998 OR2, will make its closest approach at 5:55 a.m. EDT (2:55 a.m. PDT). While this is known as a "close approach" by astronomers, it's still very far away: The asteroid will get no closer than about 3.9 million miles (6.3 million kilometers), passing more than 16 times farther away than the Moon. Asteroid 1998 OR2 was discovered by the Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking program at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in July 1998, and for the past two decades astronomers have tracked it. As a result, we understand its orbital trajectory very precisely, and we can say with confidence that this asteroid poses no possibility of impact for at least the next 200 years. Its next close approach to Earth will occur in 2079, when it will pass by closer - only about four times the lunar distance."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7649">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope’s iconic images and scientific breakthroughs have redefined our view of the Universe. To commemorate three decades of scientific discoveries, this image is one of the most photogenic examples of the many turbulent stellar nurseries the telescope has observed during its 30-year lifetime. The portrait features the giant nebula NGC 2014 and its neighbour NGC 2020 which together form part of a vast star-forming region in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, approximately 163 000 light-years away. The image is nicknamed the 'Cosmic Reef' because it resembles an undersea world. On 24 April 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope was launched on the Space Shuttle Discovery, along with a five-astronaut crew. Deployed into low Earth orbit a day later, the telescope has since opened our eyes to the cosmos and transformed our collective knowledge of the Universe."</em> <a href="https://sci.esa.int/web/hubble/-/hubble-celebrates-its-30th-anniversary-with-a-tapestry-of-blazing-starbirth">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Black holes aren't stationary in space; in fact, they can be quite active in their movements. But because they are completely dark and can't be observed directly, they're not easy to study. Scientists have finally figured out the precise timing of a complicated dance between two enormous black holes, revealing hidden details about the physical characteristics of these mysterious cosmic objects. The OJ 287 galaxy hosts one of the largest black holes ever found, with over 18 billion times the mass of our Sun. Orbiting this behemoth is another black hole with about 150 million times the Sun's mass. Twice every 12 years, the smaller black hole crashes through the enormous disk of gas surrounding its larger companion, creating a flash of light brighter than a trillion stars - brighter, even, than the entire Milky Way galaxy."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7648">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Micron Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: MU), today announced the first open-source, heterogeneous-memory storage engine (HSE), designed specifically for solid-state drives (SSDs) and storage-class memory (SCM). Legacy storage engines born in the era of hard disk drives (HDDs) failed to architecturally provide for the increased performance and reduced latency of next-generation nonvolatile media. HSE, originally developed by Micron and now available to the open-source community, is ideal for developers using all-flash infrastructure who require the benefits of open-source software, including the ability to customize or enhance code for their unique use cases. “As the only company developing storage class memory, flash and DRAM technologies, Micron is uniquely positioned to build a software stack that accelerates applications running in today’s flash-based storage environments as well as storage class memory-based infrastructure of the future,” said Derek Dicker, corporate vice president and general manager of the Storage Business Unit at Micron. “We have delivered a first-of-its-kind innovation for open-source storage developers, unlocking the full potential of high-performance storage applications.” In addition to delivering performance and endurance improvements, HSE reduces latency, especially for large-scale data sets, through intelligent data placement. HSE improves throughput of particular storage applications by up to six times, reduces latency 11 times1 and improves SSD endurance by seven times."</em> <a href="https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-unveils-worlds-first-open-source-storage-engine-designed">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/akw5g4/artificial-intelligence-cannot-be-inventors-us-patent-office-rules">Artificial Intelligence Cannot Be Inventors, US Patent Office Rules</a></h2>

<p><em>"On Monday, the United States Patent and Trademark Office published a decision that claims artificial intelligences cannot be inventors. Only “natural persons” currently have the right to get a patent. Last year, two relatively mundane patents—one for a shape-shifting food container and another for an emergency flashlight—posed an existential question for international patent regulations around the world: Does an inventor have to be a human? These two inventions were the work of DABUS, an artificial intelligence system created by physicist and AI researcher Stephen Thaler. Now, the USPTO has decided that DABUS and any other AI cannot be listed as an inventor on a patent filing. Until now, US patent law was vague about whether machines could invent, referring to “individuals” as eligible inventors."</em> <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/akw5g4/artificial-intelligence-cannot-be-inventors-us-patent-office-rules">[...]</a>

<p><em>"SpaceX CEO and founder Elon Musk has shared more details about when in 2020 we can expect the company’s Starlink low-latency, high-bandwidth satellite internet service to actually be available to customers. He said on Twitter that a private beta for Starlink would begin in around three months, with a public beta to kick off roughly three months after that. The initial beta test will apply to those located in “high latitudes,” Musk added. To date, SpaceX has said that Starlink service will initially be made available to customers in Canada and in the northern United States in 2020, with additional service expansion to follow to other parts of the world throughout 2021. On Twitter in response to a question about whether Germany counts as “high latitude,” Musk said that it does, indicating beta service at least may be available in more markets than the U.S. and Canada ahead of next year. Late last year, Musk tweeted saying he was using a Starlink satellite connection to do so, and since then the company has launched six batches of 60 satellites each to build out its network."</em> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/23/elon-musk-says-starlink-internet-private-beta-to-begin-in-roughly-three-months-public-beta-in-six/">[...]</a>

MIT researchers have developed a way to incorporate electronic sensors into stretchy fabrics, allowing them to create shirts or other garments that could be used to monitor vital signs such as temperature, respiration, and heart rate. The sensor-embedded garments, which are machine washable, can be customized to fit close to the body of the person wearing them. The researchers envision that this type of sensing could be used for monitoring people who are ill, either at home or in the hospital, as well as athletes or astronauts. “We can have any commercially available electronic parts or custom lab-made electronics embedded within the textiles that we wear every day, creating conformable garments,” says Canan Dagdeviren, the LG Electronics Career Development Assistant Professor of Media Arts and Sciences at MIT. “These are customizable, so we can make garments for anyone who needs to have some physical data from their body like temperature, respiration rate, and so forth.” Dagdeviren is the senior author of a paper describing the new material today in the journal npg Flexible Electronics."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2020/sensors-monitor-vital-signs-0423">[...]</a>

Magnons, the particles of magnetism, serve as moving information carriers. Almost 15 years ago, researchers at the University of Münster succeeded for the first time in achieving a novel quantum state of magnons at room temperature – a Bose-Einstein condensate of magnetic particles, also known as a "superatome", i.e. an extreme state of matter that usually occurs only at very low temperatures. Since then, it has been noticeable that this Bose-Einstein condensate remains spatially stable – although the theory predicted that condensate of magnons, which are attractive particles, should collapse. In a recent study, the researchers have now shown for the first time that the magnons within the condensate behave in a repulsive manner, which leads to the stabilization of the condensate."</em> <a href="https://www.uni-muenster.de/news/view.php?cmdid=10966">[...]</a>

Metal halide perovskites are a material that have shown great potential for photon-related technologies such as light-emitting diodes and lasers, but scientists have still been working to make them more efficient and effective. “The fabrication of new generation color displays and solid-state lighting requires luminescent materials and devices of the three primary colors, red, green and blue,” Ma said. “Although multiple ways of color tuning have been demonstrated for perovskites to achieve highly efficient green and red emissions, producing efficient and stable blue emissions is not trivial. This work provides a facile technique to prepare highly efficient blue emitting thin films.” Ma’s research group at FSU has been working on the development and study of metal halide perovskites and perovskite-related materials for optoelectronics and energy applications since 2014."</em> <a href="https://news.fsu.edu/news/2020/04/24/fsu-researchers-discover-new-structure-for-promising-class-of-materials/">[...]</a>

The film is coated by dipping it in a solution that contains silver nanowires.
