<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1814, o Matemático britânico <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Joseph_Sylvester">James Joseph Sylvester</a>. Ele, juntamente com Arthur Cayley, fundou a teoria dos invariantes algébricos, coeficientes de equação algébrica que permanecem inalterados quando os eixos coordenados são transladados ou girados. Sylvester fez um trabalho importante na teoria da matriz, em particular, para estudar geometria dimensional superior. Em 1851, ele descobriu o discriminante de uma equação cúbica.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1874, o geofísico e matemático norueguês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_St%C3%B8rmer">Fredrik Carl Mülertz Størmer</a>. Ele ficou conhecido por desenvolver uma teoria matemática dos fenómenos aurorais. Uma aurora é a luz emitida por protões e electrões energéticos no topo da atmosfera da Terra quando eles entram em contacto com partículas do vento solar. Ele também contribuiu com importantes observações fotográficas e dados matemáticos para a compreensão da aurora polar, das nuvens estratosféricas e mesosféricas, e da estrutura da ionosfera. A descoberta dos cinturões de radiação de Van Allen por James Van Allen confirmou com surpreendente precisão a análise teórica de Størmer das trajectórias de partículas carregadas com energia solar no campo magnético da Terra.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1875, o engenheiro automóvel austríaco <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Porsche">Ferdinand Porsche</a>. Ele projectou o popular carro Volkswagen. Em 1900, como um jovem engenheiro e piloto de testes, Porsche tinha criado os motores do cubo da roda do Lohner-Porsche Electric Car exposto na Exposição de Paris, tornando o nome Porsche famoso mundialmente. Em 1935, a ideia de Adolph Hitler - o Carocha - foi projectado por Porsche. Hitler queria um carro construído para as massas. Em 1938, o primeiro Carocha foi concluído - pouco antes da eclosão da Segunda Guerra Mundial. O carro ofereceu tecnologia inovadora, incluindo motor refrigerado a ar, formato atípico, sem grade frontal e motor traseiro. Foi só em 1946 que o Volkswagen (cujo nome significa "carro do povo") entrou em produção em série.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1883, o físico americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_D._Arnold">Harold DeForest Arnold</a>. As suas pesquisas levaram ao desenvolvimento da telefonia de longa distância e da comunicação por rádio. Ele trabalhou na Western Electric em tubos termiônicos, que amplificavam os sinais de rádio e telefone, levando à telefonia transcontinental (Julho de 1914). Mesmo antes da linha intercontinental ser concluída, Arnold estava a dirigir o trabalho no desenvolvimento de novos tubos de alta potência para estender o serviço telefónico por rádio a outros continentes. A primeira demonstração intercontinental de telefone por rádio (29 de Setembro de 1915) foi transmitida da cidade de Nova York para Arlington, Virgínia, e depois para São Francisco e Honolulu.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1905, o físico americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_David_Anderson">Carl David Anderson</a>. Ele partilhou (com Victor Francis Hess da Áustria) o Prémio Nobel de Física em 1936 pela sua descoberta do positrão, ou electrão positivo, a primeira partícula conhecida de antimatéria. Ele examinou as fotos de raios cósmicos tiradas ao passar por uma câmara de nuvem de Wilson num campo magnético forte. Além dos caminhos curvos dos electrões negativos, ele encontrou também caminhos que se desviam na direcção oposta, correspondendo a partículas carregadas positivamente - mas tendo a mesma massa de um electrão! Anteriormente, Dirac previu tais partículas por solução teórica para equações de campo electromagnético. Anderson posteriormente descobriu a existência física do positrão.</p>

<p>À precisamente 44 anos a nave espacial Viking II pousou em Marte e tirou as primeiras fotos da sua superfície. A sua irmã gémea, a Viking I, foi a primeira a chegar à superfície de Marte a 20 de Julho de 1976. Cada sonda continha instrumentos que examinavam as propriedades físicas e magnéticas do solo; analisou a atmosfera e os padrões climáticos de Marte; e determinou qualquer evidência de vida passada ou presente. Cada nave Viking, lançada dentro do cone do nariz de um foguetão Titan Centaur, era composta de duas partes: um orbitador e um módulo de aterragem. O trabalho inicial do orbitador era pesquisar o planeta em busca de um local de pouso adequado. Mais tarde, os instrumentos do orbitador estudaram o planeta e sua atmosfera, enquanto o orbitador actuou como uma estação de retransmissão de rádio para transmitir dados da sonda.</p>

<p>Em 1752, o dia 3 de Setembro não existiu na Grã-Bretanha, nem as 10 datas seguintes. O calendário juliano da era romana estava 11 dias fora de sincronia em relação ao ciclo solar. A Bretanha e suas colónias americanas adoptaram o calendário gregoriano, que mudou a data deste dia de 3 de Setembro para 14 de Setembro. As pessoas revoltaram-se nas ruas pensando que o governo tinha roubado 11 dias das suas vidas. Instituído pelo Papa Gregório XIII em 1582, o calendário tem 365 dias com um dia extra a cada quatro anos (o ano bissexto), excepto em anos divisíveis por 100, mas não divisíveis por 400. Assim, o ano civil tem uma duração média de 365,2422 dias. Outros países demoraram bastante mais tempo a mudar, fazendo a mudança apenas no século XX. Em Portugal a mudança foi feita quase 200 anos antes.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou a empresa de biotecnologia Neuralink fez uma apresentação da sua tecnologia de interface homem-máquina. O CEO da Tesla e da SpaceX, Elon Musk fez uma apresentação com direito a live-demo onde explicou as mais-valias da tecnologia desenvolvida pela Neuralink e mostrou-a aplicada a porcos. A tecnologia da Neuralink, afirma o fundador, "combinará inteligência biológica com inteligência de máquina" e talvez nos ajude a sobreviver ao apocalipse da IA.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou o satélite OGO-1 - Orbiting Geophysics Observatory - lançado em 1964, saiu da sua órbita para se despenhar contra a atmosfera da Terra. Com cerca de 487Kg o satélite foi o primeiro de uma série de cinco missões para ajudar os cientistas a entender o ambiente magnético a volta da Terra. Foi o ultimo a sair da sua órbita. Desde 1971 que já tinha sido descomissionado.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou foram igualmente lançados mais 60 satélites da constelação Starlink a bordo de um foguetão da SpaceX e foi feito o lançamento a partir da Guiana Francesa do foguetão Vega que transportou 53 satélites. Operado pela ESA este é especializado em transportar satélites de pequena dimensão. O Vega transportou sete microssatélites com peso de 15 a 150 kg, além de 46 CubeSat (satélite de pequenas dimensões), todos libertados a cerca de 515 km e 530 km de altitude. O satélite final foi lançado cerca de 104 minutos após a descolagem. Nestes satélites estavam os dois satélites da missão FSSCat - Sistema de Satélites Federados.</p>

<p><em>"On Friday, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk will reveal a major update of his biotech startup Neuralink and demonstrate a “working device” for the company’s hyped brain-machine interface. Neuralink’s technology, the founder claims, will “merge biological intelligence with machine intelligence” and perhaps help us survive the AI apocalypse. Neuralink was first introduced to the public at an event in June 2019 when Musk unveiled his next big idea: implanting a wireless chip into a human brain by drilling a small hole in the skull and inserting thin, flexible “threads” of electrodes through brain tissue. If successful, a brain implant like this could revolutionize medicine, Musk teased, such as treating brain injuries, depression, addiction and other neurological disorders. The technology is only half the equation. Last year, Musk noted that putting a chip in someone’s head would require a neurosurgeon, which can be expensive and hard to scale."</em> <a href="https://observer.com/2020/08/elon-musk-reveal-neuralink-brain-chip-implant-ai-friday/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.space.com/nasa-vintage-ogo-1-satellite-fiery-doom-reentry-up.html">Vintage NASA satellite falls to Earth, meets fiery doom after 56 years in space</a></h2>

<p><em>"A long-retired NASA satellite burned up in Earth's atmosphere over the weekend, the agency has confirmed. NASA launched the satellite, called Orbiting Geophysics Observatory 1, or OGO-1, in September 1964, the first in a series of five missions to help scientists understand the magnetic environment around Earth. OGO-1 was the first to launch but the last to fall out of orbit; the satellite had circled Earth aimlessly since its retirement in 1971. But orbiting Earth is a tricky thing to do, since the particles in our plush atmosphere collide with spacecraft and slow them down, even at very high altitudes where the atmosphere is thin. That speed reduction also lowers the spacecraft's altitude, until reentry becomes inevitable. The 1,070-lb."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/nasa-vintage-ogo-1-satellite-fiery-doom-reentry-up.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"With tonight’s successful Vega launch from the Spaceport in French Guiana, Arianespace has extended Europe’s access to space with a new capability to address the rapidly growing segment of small satellites. Lifting off from the Spaceport’s Vega Launch Complex at 10:51 p.m. local time in French Guiana on September 2 – the planned precise moment of launch – Vega deployed 40-plus small CubeSats and seven microsatellites using a new-design rideshare dispenser system for the Small Spacecraft Mission Service (SSMS). The satellite passengers on the SSMS Proof of Concept rideshare mission were released into Sun-synchronous orbits during a flight sequence lasting 1 hr. and 44 min. from liftoff to final separation, involving multiple deployments with the SSMS dispenser. These spacecraft will serve various applications – including Earth observation, telecommunications, science, technology and education."</em> <a href="https://www.arianespace.com/mission-update/vv16-launch-success/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The CERN Control Centre (CCC) is abuzz once again. The second long shutdown (LS2) has come to an end for CERN’s newest accelerator – Linac 4 – and the accelerator complex’s slow awakening from a two-year repair-and-recuperation hibernation has begun. The three-week machine-development run until mid-August saw low-energy beams of negative hydrogen ions (H−) fly through the first part of the accelerator for the first time since it was connected to the PS Booster. On 20 August, the first beams at the nominal energy of 160 MeV were accelerated through the entire machine and into a dedicated beam dump located at the end of the linac. Over the coming months, the brand-new accelerator will finish being commissioned and will be made ready to deliver various beams to the PS Booster in December. CERN is famous for its circular accelerators, in particular the 27-kilometre-circumference Large Hadron Collider."</em> <a href="https://home.cern/news/news/accelerators/ls2-report-cerns-newest-accelerator-awakens">[...]</a>

<p><em>"SkyDrive conducted a public flight demonstration of its piloted SD-03 eVTOL on Aug. 25 — the first such demo of a “flying car” in Japan, the company said. The flight took place at the Toyota Test Field in Toyota City, which at 10,000 square meters (2.5 acres) is one of the largest test fields in Japan and home to the company’s development base. A pilot was at the controls for the approximately four-minute flight, but a computer-assisted control system helped ensure flight stability and safety, while technical staff at the field monitored flight conditions and performance at all times. SkyDrive announced earlier this year that it had completed an initial phase of crewed flight testing with its eVTOL prototype aircraft between December 2019 and March 2020. Compared to that prototype, the aircraft that flew this week has sleeker fairings in a pearl-white finish, “which was chosen to represent white birds and the floating clouds in the sky of users’ future,” according to a press release. “We are extremely excited to have achieved Japan’s first-ever manned flight of a flying car in the two years since we founded SkyDrive in 2018 with the goal of commercializing such aircraft,” stated SkyDrive CEO Tomohiro Fukuzawa."</em> <a href="https://evtol.com/news/video-skydrive-sd-03-evtol-public-flight/">[...]</a>

Amazon and its competitors must still clear some imposing regulatory and technical hurdles before small packages holding the likes of cat food or toothpaste can routinely be dropped at people’s homes. But the action shows that they’ve convinced the government they’re ready to operate in the highly regulated aviation sector. “This certification is an important step forward for Prime Air and indicates the FAA’s confidence in Amazon’s operating and safety procedures for an autonomous drone delivery service that will one day deliver packages to our customers around the world,” David Carbon, an Amazon vice president who oversees Prime Air, said in a statement."</em> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-31/amazon-s-drone-delivery-fleet-hits-milestone-with-faa-clearance">[...]</a>

Designed with ST’s proprietary 130nm CMOS technology already proven throughout the space industry, the new devices combine their speed advantage with low operating current and a best-in-class radiation hardness with an RHA (Radiation Hardness Assurance) qualified TID2 at 300 krad (Si) and immunity to SEL and SET3 up to 125 MeV.cm2/mg. Their supply-voltage range of 1.8V-3.6V helps meet the tight power and energy restrictions typical on-board satellites and space vehicles. The RHFOSC04 combines the roles of multiple discrete logic components to drive a crystal oscillator directly, which simplifies circuit design and enhances stability while saving board space and increasing system reliability.

<p><em>"Suppression of long-lived energetic states called triplet excitons shown to be key for preventing the “lasing death” that has been limiting long operation An international team of researchers led by Kyushu University and Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, has demonstrated stable, continuous lasing at room temperature for over an hour from a class of low-cost materials called perovskites by finally overcoming a phenomenon that has so far prevented such long operation. Used in everything from manufacturing and research to communications and entertainment because of their highly uniform light emission, lasers are often classified by the material in them that converts input energy—usually either light or electricity—into light, with common materials including inorganic and organic semiconductors, gases, and crystals. Recent developments in a class of materials known as perovskites have made them attractive for lasers because they can be fabricated from solution at low cost to have tunable colors and excellent stability, but a phenomenon termed lasing death causes lasing under constant operation at room temperature to stop after a few minutes for reasons that have been unclear. Now, researchers from Kyushu University and Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry report in the journal Nature that they have managed to overcome lasing death in quasi-2D perovskites by taking into consideration energetic states called triplet excitons. “The realization of lasers based on organic semiconductors has primarily been impeded by losses caused by the buildup of triplets. However, the situation for triplets in quasi-2D perovskites had yet to be fully considered,” says Chuanjiang Qin, professor of Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and lead researcher on the study."</em> <a href="https://www.kyushu-u.ac.jp/en/researches/view/163">[...]</a>

But most of the time, creating a quantum algorithm that stands a chance at beating a classical computer is an accidental process, Purdue University scientists say. To bring more guidance to this process and make it less arbitrary, these scientists developed a new theory that may eventually lead to more systematic design of quantum algorithms. The new theory, described in a paper published in the journal Advanced Quantum Technologies, is the first known attempt to determine which quantum states can be created and processed with an acceptable number of quantum gates to outperform a classical algorithm. Physicists refer to this concept of having the right number of gates to control each state as “complexity.” Since the complexity of a quantum algorithm is closely related to the complexity of quantum states involved in the algorithm, the theory could therefore bring order to the search for quantum algorithms by characterizing which quantum states meet that complexity criteria. An algorithm is a sequence of steps to perform a calculation."</em> <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2020/Q3/new-theory-hints-at-more-efficient-way-to-develop-quantum-algorithms.html">[...]</a>

Now Justus Ndukaife, assistant professor of electrical engineering at Vanderbilt University, has developed the first-ever opto-thermo-electrohydrodynamic tweezers, optical nanotweezers that can trap and manipulate objects on an even smaller scale. The article, “Stand-off trapping and manipulation of sub-10 nm objects and biomolecules using opto-thermo-electrohydrodynamic tweezers” was published online in the journal Nature Nanotechnology on August 31. The article was authored by Ndukaife and graduate students Chuchuan Hong and Sen Yang, who are conducting research in Ndukaife’s lab. Micron-scale optical tweezers represent a significant advancement in biological research but are limited in the size of the objects they can work with. This is because the laser beam that acts as the pincer of an optical tweezer can only focus the laser light to a certain diameter (about half the laser’s wavelength)."</em> <a href="https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2020/08/31/tiny-tweezer-developed-at-vanderbilt-can-trap-molecules-on-a-nanoscale-creating-powerful-research-capabilities-into-cancer-metastasis-neurodegenerative-diseases/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"What happens if an electric car burns in a road tunnel or an underground car park? In the Hagerbach test tunnel in Switzerland, Empa researchers and tunnel safety expert Lars Derek Mellert set fire to battery cells of electric cars, analyzed the distribution of soot and smoke gases and the chemical residues in the extinguishing water. There' s a loud bang, and then it starts: A battery module of an electric car is on fire in the Hagerbach test tunnel. A video of the test impressively shows the energy stored in such batteries: Meter-long flames hiss through the room and produce enormous amounts of thick, black soot. The visibility in the previously brightly lit tunnel section quickly approaches zero.

<p><em>"A new, miniature, low-frequency antenna with enhanced bandwidth will enable robust networking among compact, mobile robots in complex environments. In a collaborative effort between the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command’s Army Research Laboratory and the University of Michigan, researchers developed a novel design approach that improves upon limitations of conventional antennas operating at low frequencies—demonstrating smaller antennas that maintain performance. Impedance matching is a key aspect of antenna design, ensuring that the radio transmits power through the antenna with minimal reflections while in transmit mode—and that when the antenna is in receive mode, it captures power to efficiently couple to the radio over all frequencies within the operational bandwidth. “Conventional impedance matching techniques with passive components—such as resistors, inductors and capacitors—have a fundamental limit, known as the Chu-Wheeler limit, which defines a bound for the maximum achievable bandwidth-efficiency product for a given antenna size,” said Army researcher Dr. Fikadu Dagefu. “In general, low-frequency antennas are physically large, or their miniaturized counterparts have very limited bandwidth and efficiency, resulting in higher power requirement.” With those challenges in mind, the researchers developed a novel approach that improves bandwidth and efficiency without increasing size or changing the topology of the antenna. “The proposed impedance matching approach applies a modular active circuit to a highly miniaturized, efficient, lightweight antenna—overcoming the aforementioned Chu-Wheeler performance limit,” said Army postdoctoral researcher Dr. Jihun Choi."</em> <a href="https://www.army.mil/article/238670/miniature_antenna_enables_robotic_teaming_in_complex_environments">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The world is one step closer to having a totally secure internet and an answer to the growing threat of cyber-attacks, thanks to a team of international scientists who have created a unique prototype which could transform how we communicate online. The invention led by the University of Bristol, revealed today in the journal Science Advances, has the potential to serve millions of users, is understood to be the largest-ever quantum network of its kind, and could be used to secure people’s online communication, particularly in these internet-led times accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. By deploying a new technique, harnessing the simple laws of physics, it can make messages completely safe from interception while also overcoming major challenges which have previously limited advances in this little used but much-hyped technology. Lead author Dr Siddarth Joshi, who headed the project at the university’s Quantum Engineering Technology (QET) Labs, said: “This represents a massive breakthrough and makes the quantum internet a much more realistic proposition. Until now, building a quantum network has entailed huge cost, time, and resource, as well as often compromising on its security which defeats the whole purpose.” “Our solution is scalable, relatively cheap and, most important of all, impregnable. That means it’s an exciting game changer and paves the way for much more rapid development and widespread rollout of this technology.” The current internet relies on complex codes to protect information, but hackers are increasingly adept at outsmarting such systems leading to cyber-attacks across the world which cause major privacy breaches and fraud running into trillions of pounds annually."</em> <a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2020/september/quantum-breakthrough.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers in the Cockrell School of Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin have built a new type of battery that combines the many benefits of existing options while eliminating their key shortcomings and saving energy. Most batteries are composed of either solid-state electrodes, such as lithium-ion batteries for portable electronics, or liquid-state electrodes, including flow batteries for smart grids. The UT researchers have created what they call a “room-temperature all-liquid-metal battery,” which includes the best of both worlds of liquid- and solid-state batteries. Solid-state batteries feature significant capacity for energy storage, but they typically encounter numerous problems that cause them to degrade over time and become less efficient. Liquid-state batteries can deliver energy more efficiently, without the long-term decay of sold-state devices, but they either fall short on high energy demands or require significant resources to constantly heat the electrodes and keep them molten. The metallic electrodes in the team’s battery can remain liquefied at a temperature of 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit), the lowest operating temperature ever recorded for a liquid-metal battery, according to the researchers."</em> <a href="https://news.utexas.edu/2020/07/06/new-room-temperature-liquid-metal-battery-could-be-the-path-to-powering-the-future/">[...]</a>

In a new study, recently published online in Production and Operations Management, three faculty members from the Naveen Jindal School of Management explored how drone delivery could change retail logistics networks. The paper focuses on the use of customer-facing delivery centers, also known as last-mile warehouses. Dr. Milind Dawande, professor of operations management and one of the paper’s co-authors, said last-mile retail delivery via drones is being viewed as a truly disruptive technology. Retailers worldwide are pursuing approaches to enable faster delivery, and drones arguably represent the most encouraging technological innovation toward this goal, he said. The study found that both the number of last-mile warehouses and the delivery speed of the drones will increase as technology matures."</em> <a href="https://www.utdallas.edu/news/business-management/drone-delivery-study-2020/">[...]</a>

The research team, which includes physicists from the University of Maryland, detected two black holes merging, but one of the black holes was 1 1/2 times more massive than any ever observed in a black hole collision. The researchers believe the heavier black hole in the pair may be the result of a previous merger between two black holes. This type of hierarchical combining of black holes has been hypothesized in the past but the observed event, labeled GW190521, would be the first evidence for such activity. The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) Scientific Collaboration (LSC) and Virgo Collaboration announced the discovery in two papers published September 2, 2020, in the journals Physical Review Letters and Astrophysical Journal Letters.
