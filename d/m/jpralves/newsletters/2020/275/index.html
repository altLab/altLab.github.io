<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1667, o matemático suíço <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Bernoulli">Johann Bernoulli</a>. Ele ficou conhecido pela sua descoberta do cálculo exponencial (1691) e da equação da catenária (1690). A sua primeira publicação foi sobre o processo de fermentação (1690), mas depois disso, ele estudou e ensinou matemática ao longo da sua vida. Ele seguiu o seu irmão Jacques como professor de matemática em Basileia. Ele foi o primeiro a usar g para representar a aceleração devido à gravidade. Ele aplicou o então novo cálculo à medição de curvas, equações diferenciais e problemas mecânicos. Ele introduziu o famoso problema do braquistocromo. “Arquimedes de sua idade” estava inscrito em sua lápide.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1766, o químico e físico inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hyde_Wollaston">William Hyde Wollaston</a>. Ele é responsável pela descoberta do paládio (1803) e do ródio (1804), durante sua investigação do minério de platina. Ele desenvolveu um método de formação de platina - metalurgia do pó - e foi o primeiro a produzir platina maleável e dúctil em escala comercial. Ele tornou o seu método público na Royal Society em 28 de Novembro de 1828, pouco antes de sua morte. Em 1801, ele provou experimentalmente que a electricidade de atrito e a corrente são iguais. Ele é particularmente conhecido por ser o primeiro a observar linhas escuras no espectro do sol, que eventualmente levaram à descoberta dos elementos solares. Ele construiu o prisma Wollaston, um divisor de feixe polarizador (agora aplicado nos leitores de CD) e inventou a câmara lúcida.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1881, o bacteriologista escocês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Fleming">Alexander Fleming</a>. Ele ficou conhecido pela sua descoberta da penicilina. Em 1928, enquanto trabalhava no vírus influenza, ele observou que o mofo tinha-se desenvolvido acidentalmente numa placa de cultura de estafilococos e que o mofo tinha criado um círculo livre de bactérias em torno de si. Ele experimentou mais e descobriu que uma cultura de fungos impedia o crescimento de estafilococos, mesmo quando diluída 800 vezes. A substância activa, que chamou de penicilina, deu início à prática altamente eficaz da antibioticoterapia para doenças infecciosas. Fleming partilhou o Prémio Nobel de Fisiologia ou Medicina em 1945 com Ernst Boris Chain e Howard Walter Florey, que ambos (a partir de 1939) continuaram o trabalho de Fleming.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1943, o  cientista da computação americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Postel">Jon Postel</a>. Ele desempenhou um papel fundamental na criação e administração da Internet. No final da década de 1960, Postel era um estudante de pós-graduação a desenvolver a ARPANET, um precursor da Internet para uso do Departamento de Defesa dos EUA. Como director da Autoridade para Atribuição de Números da Internet (IANA), que ele formou, Postel foi o criador do sistema de endereços da Internet. A Internet cresceu rapidamente na década de 1990 e existia a preocupação com a sua falta de regulamentação. Pouco antes de sua morte, Postel apresentou uma proposta ao governo dos EUA para uma organização internacional sem fins lucrativos que supervisionaria a Internet e seus nomes e números atribuídos.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou dois astronautas da NASA regressaram em segurança após o primeiro voo comercial da tripulação para a estação espacial. No passado domingo aterraram no golfo do México vindos da Estação Espacial Internacional. O Crew Dragon da SpaceX, carregando Robert Behnken e Douglas Hurley, caiu sob para-quedas no Golfo do México, na costa de Pensacola, Flórida, às 14h48. EDT domingo e foram recuperados com sucesso pela SpaceX.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou foi lançada uma nova versão do Kernel Linux. Considerada por Linus Torvalds uma actualização "realmente grande", a versão 5.8 do Kernel foi lançada. Nesta nova versão destacam-se os drivers actualizados com suporte para uma serie de GPU adreno, patchs para a vulnerabilidade Spectre, melhorias no filesystem exFAT, driver de gestão de energia da AMD, capacidades de compressão no filesystem F2FS, entre outros.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos assim como projetos de maker.</p>

<p><em>"Two NASA astronauts splashed down safely in the Gulf of Mexico Sunday for the first time in a commercially built and operated American crew spacecraft, returning from the International Space Station to complete a test flight that marks a new era in human spaceflight. SpaceX’s Crew Dragon, carrying Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley, splashed down under parachutes in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Pensacola, Florida at 2:48 p.m. EDT Sunday and was successfully recovered by SpaceX. After returning to shore, the astronauts immediately will fly back to Houston. “Welcome home, Bob and Doug! Congratulations to the NASA and SpaceX teams for the incredible work to make this test flight possible,” said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. “It’s a testament to what we can accomplish when we work together to do something once thought impossible."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-astronauts-safely-splash-down-after-first-commercial-crew-flight-to-space-station">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Linus Torvalds has recently shipped Linux kernel 5,8, nearly a month of a half after he announced this release as a “really big” update that reminds of the 4.9 version. “I considered making an rc8 all the way to the last minute, but decided it's not just worth waiting another week when there aren't any big looming worries around,” Torvalds explains. New in this fresh version of the kernel are the updated drivers that add support for a series of Adreno GPU chips like the 405, 640, and 650 versions, the new Spectre patches, as well as exFAT refinements. Radeon drivers are also getting improved support in this release, and so is the POWER10 chip whose launch is currently projected to happen sometime next year. Lots of smaller changes But as Torvalds said back in June, Linux kernel 5.8 is a massive release because of all the small changes that are part of the update. And there are a lot of them, Torvalds originally said."</em> <a href="https://news.softpedia.com/news/linus-torvalds-releases-the-really-big-linux-kernel-5-8-530707.shtml">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers propose how we can we measure and monitor tire wear with tire wear sensors, increasing safety on the road, saving drivers money, and ultimately, saving lives. Has your car ever lost traction with the road during inclement weather? When car tires wear out, they pose a huge safety threat to vehicles and drivers. Although the lifespan of a tire depends on many factors, like the type of vehicle, driver habits, road conditions, and tire brand, drivers are encouraged to change their tires when the tread wears out. It was during a visit to Bridgestone Americas Technical Center in Akron, Ohio that researchers from Carnegie Mellon University; Akarsh Prabhakara, Vaibhav Singh, Swarun KumarOpens in new window, and Anthony RoweOpens in new window, came across this interesting problem: How can we measure and monitor tire wear?

<p><em>"A complex process can modify non-magnetic oxide materials in such a way to make them magnetic. The basis for this new phenomenon is controlled layer-by-layer growth of each material. An international research team with researchers from Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg (MLU) reported on their unexpected findings in the journal "Nature Communications". In solid-state physics, oxide layers only a few nanometres thick are known to form a so-called two-dimensional electron gas. These thin layers, separated from one another, are transparent and electrically insulating materials. However, when one thin layer grows on top of the other, a conductive area forms under certain conditions at the interface, which has a metallic shine."</em> <a href="https://pressemitteilungen.pr.uni-halle.de/index.php?modus=pmanzeige&amp;pm_id=5061">[...]</a>

<p><em>"NUS physicists have demonstrated the control of magnetism in a magnetic semiconductor via electrical means, paving the way for novel spintronic devices. Semiconductors are the heart of information-processing technologies. In the form of a transistor, semiconductors act as a switch for electrical charge, allowing switching between binary states zero and one. Magnetic materials, on the other hand, are an essential component for information storage devices. They exploit the spin degree of freedom of electrons to achieve memory functions. Magnetic semiconductors are a unique class of materials that allow control of both the electrical charge and spin, potentially enabling information processing and memory operations in a single platform."</em> <a href="https://www.science.nus.edu.sg/blog/2020/08/06/an-electrical-switch-for-magnetism/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Argonne scientists use temperature data to tune — and fix — defects in 3D-printed metallic parts. With its ability to yield parts with complex shapes and minimal waste, additive manufacturing has the potential to revolutionize the production of metallic components. That potential, however, is currently limited by one critical challenge: controlling defects in the process that can compromise the performance of 3D-printed materials. A new paper in the journal Additive Manufacturing points to a possible breakthrough solution: Use temperature data at the time of production to predict the formation of subsurface defects so they can be addressed right then and there. A team of researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory, together with a colleague now at Texas A&amp;M University, discovered the possibility. “Ultimately you would be able to print something and collect temperature data at the source and you could see if there were some abnormalities, and then fix them or start over,” said Aaron Greco, group manager for Argonne’s Interfacial Mechanics &amp; Materials group in the Applied Materials Division (AMD) and a study author."</em> <a href="https://www.anl.gov/article/promising-new-research-identifies-innovative-approach-for-controlling-defects-in-3d-printing">[...]</a>

<p><em>"From cell phones to solar cells - research has implications for improvements in a wide range of technologies A McGill research team has developed a new technique to detect nano-sized imperfections in materials. They believe this discovery will lead to improvements in the optical detectors used in a wide range of technologies, from cell phones to cameras and fiber optics, as well as in solar cells. The researchers, led by Professor Peter Grutter from McGill’s Physics Department, used atomic force microscopy to detect the ultrafast forces that arise when light interacts with matter. In their paper, published this week in PNAS, they demonstrate that forces arising from two, time-delayed light pulses can be detected with sub-femtosecond precision (these are millionths of a billionth of a second) and nanometer spatial resolution in a wide range of materials. Improved technique for using light to detect imperfections in materials “To understand and improve materials, scientists typically use light pulses faster than 100 femtoseconds to explore how quickly reactions occur and determine the slowest steps in the process,” explains Zeno Schumacher, the paper’s first author who was a post-doctoral fellow in Grutter’s lab when the research was done and is now based at ETH Zurich. “The electric field of a light pulse oscillates every few femtoseconds and will push and pull on the atomic-sized charges and ions that comprise matter."</em> <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/channels/news/may-force-be-you-detecting-ultrafast-light-its-force-323479">[...]</a>

As described in a recently published paper in Scientific Reports, an LLNL team led by biomedical scientist Heather Enright cultured rodent-derived neurons on microelectrode arrays on a two-dimensional “brain-on-chip” device. They allowed the neuronal cultures to form networks, supplementing them with other cell types found in the brain -- astrocytes and oligodendrocytes -- which play a critical role in neuronal health and function. For more than a month in culture, the team monitored the neurons' electrical activity and characterized their molecular profile as they grew and matured over time. Researchers said the study establishes key differences between neuronal cultures of varying complexity, which will allow them to more accurately mimic the behavior of an animal brain in three-dimensional in vitro devices. “It was clear from what we had done in the earlier work that we needed to enhance the cellular complexity of these devices to more accurately recapitulate the function of the brain in an animal system,” Enright said."</em> <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/news/neuronal-cultures-advance-brain-chip-technology">[...]</a>

Highly permeable and selective membranes are useful for a wide range of applications, such as dialysis, water purification and energy storage. However, conventional synthetic membranes based on two-dimensional structures suffer from the trade-off limitation between permeability and selectivity, arising from their intrinsically limited surface area and long complex pore geometries. Taking a cue from biological systems that achieve a highly selective and rapid trans-membrane mass transport by employing efficient 3D functional structures, the team developed a self-supportive 3D membrane composed of two 3D interconnected channels, which are separated by a nanometer-thin porous titanium-oxide (TiO2) layer. This unique biomimetic 3D architecture dramatically increases the surface area, and thus the filtration area, by 6,000 times, coupled with an ultra-short diffusion distance through the 2-4-nm-thin selective layer.

<p><em>"Last time we examined how to program the STM8s microcontroller using the Arduino IDE. This way may work for developers who are familiar with the IDE and want to build quickly, and professional projects, but there are more ways to get the same result. Thus for today’s tutorial, we are going to examine how to use traditional tools like the Cosmic C compiler along with STVD to program the STM8s microcontrollers. There are several members of the STM8s microcontroller out there but for this tutorial, we will work with the STM8S103F3P6 microcontroller which is one of the cheapest, and most popular member of the family. The popularity of the STM8S103F3P6 makes it a perfect microcontroller for beginners as you can easily find support for it across several forums on the internet. For easy prototyping, we will use the STM8sBlue development board which is essentially a breakout board for the STM8S103F3P6 MCU with a USB interface, breadboard compatibility, and a few other components to facilitate the development of prototypes for projects based on the MCU."</em> <a href="https://www.electronics-lab.com/project/getting-started-with-stm8s-using-stvd-and-cosmic-c-compiler/">[...]</a>

This monitor uses a capacitive soil moisture sensor and a 3.3V Arduino Pro Mini to continuously monitor the soil moisture level and alert you when you're over or under watering your plants. Two potentiometers on the board allow you to adjust and set a high and low moisture level setpoint which trigger the flashing of two LEDs to alert you.
