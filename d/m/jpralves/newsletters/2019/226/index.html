<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1876, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_F._Kettering">Charles F. Kettering</a>. Este Engenheiro americano registou cerca de 140 patentes que incluíam os sistemas de arranque eléctrico, iluminação para carros e sistemas de ignição. No início de sua carreira, com a National Cash Register Co., Dayton (1904-09), ele criou a primeira caixa registadora eléctrica com um motor eléctrico que abria a gaveta. Quando ele co-fundou a Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company (DELCO, com Edward A. Deeds), ele inventou o motor de arranque automático operado por chave para o Cadillac (1912) e que se espalhou para quase todos os carros novos na década de 1920. Como vice-presidente e director de pesquisa da General Motors Corp. (1920-1947), ele desenvolveu motores, acabamentos de laca de secagem rápida, combustíveis antidetonantes e transmissões de velocidade variável. Em associação com a DuPont Chemical Company, ele também foi responsável pela invenção do refrigerante Freon para sistemas de refrigeração e ar condicionado.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1959, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wolfram">Stephen Wolfram</a>. Este cientista da computação, físico e empresário britânico/americano criou o software Mathematica o conhecido sistema de álgebra computacional. Como empresário, ele é o fundador e CEO da empresa de software Wolfram Research, onde trabalhou como responsável pelo Mathematica e pelo mecanismo de resposta Wolfram Alpha. O seu trabalho recente foi sobre programação baseada no conhecimento, expandindo e refinando a linguagem de programação do Mathematica para o que agora é chamado de Wolfram Language.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou, passaram 30 anos que a sonda Voyager 2 fez um voo próximo do planeta Neptuno. Foi a 25 de Agosto de 1989, que a sonda Voyager 2 da NASA esteve perto de Neptuno, dando à humanidade o primeira vista do oitavo planeta do nosso sistema solar. A marcar o final do Grand Tour da missão Voyager pelos quatro planetas gigantes do sistema solar - Júpiter, Saturno, Úrano e Neptuno - foi o primeiro também um último: nenhuma outra sonda visitou Neptuno desde então.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. São também apresentadas as revistas newelectronics de 13 de Agosto e a MagPI nº85 de Setembro.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7482">30 Years Ago: Voyager 2's Historic Neptune Flyby</a></h2>

<p><em>"Thirty years ago, on Aug. 25, 1989, NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft made a close flyby of Neptune, giving humanity its first close-up of our solar system's eighth planet. Marking the end of the Voyager mission's Grand Tour of the solar system's four giant planets - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune - that first was also a last: No other spacecraft has visited Neptune since. "The Voyager planetary program really was an opportunity to show the public what science is all about," said Ed Stone, a professor of physics at Caltech and Voyager's project scientist since 1975. "Every day we learned something new." Wrapped in teal- and cobalt-colored bands of clouds, the planet that Voyager 2 revealed looked like a blue-hued sibling to Jupiter and Saturn, the blue indicating the presence of methane. A massive, slate-colored storm was dubbed the "Great Dark Spot," similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7482">[...]</a>

<p><em>"An atomic clock that could pave the way for autonomous deep space travel was successfully activated last week and is ready to begin its year-long tech demo, the mission team confirmed on Friday, Aug. 23, 2019. Launched in June, NASA's Deep Space Atomic Clock is a critical step toward enabling spacecraft to safely navigate themselves in deep space rather than rely on the time-consuming process of receiving directions from Earth. Developed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, the clock is the first timekeeper stable enough to map a spacecraft's trajectory in deep space while being small enough to fly onboard the spacecraft. A more stable clock can operate farther from Earth, where it needs to work well for longer periods than satellites closer to home. Atomic clocks, like those used in GPS satellites, are used to measure the distance between objects by timing how long it takes a signal to travel from Point A to Point B. For space exploration, atomic clocks must be extremely precise: an error of even one second means the difference between landing on a planet like Mars or missing it by hundreds of thousands of miles."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7487">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Japan's Hayabusa2 spacecraft has packed up the capsule that will ferry its precious space-rock cargo back to Earth in preparation to leave the asteroid Ryugu later this year. It's just one step completed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) spacecraft as the agency turns its attention to the return phase of the mission. Hayabusa2 completed its second and final sampling maneuver in July. The endeavor's completion likely means that the spacecraft's three-chamber sample storage mechanism is full up, with bits of rock from both the surface and the interior of Ryugu. Today (Aug. 26), JAXA confirmed that the sampling chamber has now been stored inside the re-entry capsule, which will be the only part of the spacecraft to return to Earth. That capsule should arrive home in late 2020."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/hayabusa2-asteroid-return-preparations.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Expanding portfolio adds certified USB 3.1 PD SmartHub™ IC with HostFlexing and PDBalancing plus standalone USB Type-C PD controller for simpler applications USB Type-C has become increasingly popular, and with the introduction of Power Delivery (PD), it is now possible to charge more types of devices – and charge faster – than ever before. To remove the traditional complexity and high costs associated with implementing USB Type-C, Microchip Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP) today announced two new solutions that simplify USB Type-C PD for a range of applications. As one of the industry’s first USB-IF-certified USB 3.1 SmartHub devices with integrated support for Power Delivery (TID1212), the USB705x family enables fast device charging and introduces unique PD implementations called HostFlexing and PDBalancing. The UPD301A is a standalone USB Type-C PD controller that significantly simplifies the implementation of basic USB Type-C PD charging functionality, making it ideal for applications from rear seat charging in vehicles to portable equipment to public charging stations. The USB705x family includes two unique features that simplify USB Type-C PD implementations – HostFlexing and PDBalancing. HostFlexing simplifies the user’s docking station experience by allowing all USB Type-C ports to function as the “notebook” port, eliminating the need for cryptic labels that try and explain overall functionality of each USB Type-C port."</em> <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en/pressreleasepage/simplify-power-delivery-in-usb-type-c-charging-market">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/carbon-nanotubes-microprocessor-0828">MIT engineers build advanced microprocessor out of carbon nanotubes</a></h2>

<p><em>"New approach harnesses the same fabrication processes used for silicon chips, offers key advance toward next-generation computers. After years of tackling numerous design and manufacturing challenges, MIT researchers have built a modern microprocessor from carbon nanotube transistors, which are widely seen as a faster, greener alternative to their traditional silicon counterparts. The microprocessor, described today in the journal Nature, can be built using traditional silicon-chip fabrication processes, representing a major step toward making carbon nanotube microprocessors more practical. Silicon transistors — critical microprocessor components that switch between 1 and 0 bits to carry out computations — have carried the computer industry for decades. As predicted by Moore’s Law, industry has been able to shrink down and cram more transistors onto chips every couple of years to help carry out increasingly complex computations. But experts now foresee a time when silicon transistors will stop shrinking, and become increasingly inefficient."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/carbon-nanotubes-microprocessor-0828">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2019/august/robot-swarms.html">Inspired from nature – robots can now learn to swarm on the go</a></h2>

<p><em>"A new generation of swarming robots which can independently learn and evolve new behaviours in the wild is one step closer, thanks to research from the University of Bristol and the University of the West of England (UWE). The team used artificial evolution to enable the robots to automatically learn swarm behaviours which are understandable to humans. This new advance published today [Friday 23 August] in Advanced Intelligent Systems, could create new robotic possibilities for environmental monitoring, disaster recovery, infrastructure maintenance, logistics and agriculture. Until now, artificial evolution has typically been run on a computer which is external to the swarm, with the best strategy then copied to the robots. However, this approach is limiting as it requires external infrastructure and a laboratory setting. By using a custom-made swarm of robots with high-processing power embedded within the swarm, the Bristol team were able to discover which rules give rise to desired swarm behaviours."</em> <a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2019/august/robot-swarms.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://now.tufts.edu/news-releases/engineers-make-transistors-and-electronic-devices-entirely-thread">Engineers make transistors and electronic devices entirely from thread</a></h2>

<p><em>"Transistors and integrated circuits made from threads are combined with thread-based sensors to create fully flexible devices A team of Tufts University engineers has developed a transistor made from linen thread, enabling them to create electronic devices made entirely of thin threads that could be woven into fabric, worn on the skin, or even (theoretically) implanted surgically for diagnostic monitoring. The fully flexible electronic devices could enable a wide range of applications that conform to different shapes and allow free movement without compromising function, the researchers say. In a study published in ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, the authors describe engineering the first thread-based transistors (TBTs) which can be fashioned into simple, all-thread based logic circuits and integrated circuits. The circuits replace the last remaining rigid component of many current flexible devices, and when combined with thread-based sensors, enable the creation of completely flexible, multiplexed devices. The field of flexible electronics is expanding rapidly, with most devices achieving flexibility by patterning metals and semiconductors into bendable “wavy” structures or using intrinsically flexible materials such as conducting polymers. These “soft” electronics are enabling applications for devices that conform and stretch with the biological tissue in which they are embedded, such as skin, heart or even brain tissue."</em> <a href="https://now.tufts.edu/news-releases/engineers-make-transistors-and-electronic-devices-entirely-thread">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Surprising behavior could safeguard information stored in quantum bits Physicists studying the strange behavior of metal alloys called heavy fermions have made a surprising discovery that could be useful in safeguarding the information stored in quantum bits, or qubits, the basic units of encoded information in quantum computers. In a study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers from Rice University and the Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien) in Austria examined the behavior of an intermetallic crystal of cerium, palladium and silicon as it was subjected to extreme cold and a strong magnetic field. To their surprise, they found they could transform the quantum behavior of the material in two unique ways, one in which electrons compete to occupy orbitals and another where they compete to occupy spin states. “The effect is so pronounced with one degree of freedom that it ends up liberating the other one,” said Rice’s Qimiao Si, co-corresponding author of the study and the director of the Rice Center for Quantum Materials (RCQM). “You can essentially tune the system to maximize damage to one of these, leaving the other well-defined.” Si said the result could be important for companies like Google, IBM, Intel and others who are competing to develop quantum computers. Unlike today’s digital computers, which use electricity or light to encode bits of information, quantum computers use the quantum states of subatomic particles like electrons to store information in qubits."</em> <a href="https://news.rice.edu/2019/08/23/quantum-criticality-could-be-a-boon-for-qubit-designers-2/">[...]</a>

It has been theorized that quantum computers would enable researchers to solve problems much faster than they could with classical computing, or even tackle problems too complex for today’s supercomputers, but that “quantum speedup” has not yet been realized. This study provides evidence that quantum annealing could one day deliver these gains.

<p><em>"Scientists at Brookhaven Lab's Center for Functional Nanomaterials created "hybrid" organic-inorganic materials for transferring ultrasmall, high-aspect-ratio features into silicon for next-generation electronic devices To increase the processing speed and reduce the power consumption of electronic devices, the microelectronics industry continues to push for smaller and smaller feature sizes. Transistors in today’s cell phones are typically 10 nanometers (nm) across—equivalent to about 50 silicon atoms wide—or smaller. Scaling transistors down below these dimensions with higher accuracy requires advanced materials for lithography—the primary technique for printing electrical circuit elements on silicon wafers to manufacture electronic chips. One challenge is developing robust “resists,” or materials that are used as templates for transferring circuit patterns into device-useful substrates such as silicon. Now, scientists from the Center for Functional Nanomaterials (CFN)—a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science User Facility at Brookhaven National Laboratory—have used the recently developed technique of infiltration synthesis to create resists that combine the organic polymer poly(methyl methacrylate), or PMMA, with inorganic aluminum oxide. Owing to its low cost and high resolution, PMMA is the most widely used resist in electron-beam lithography (EBL), a kind of lithography in which electrons are used to create the pattern template."</em> <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=116681">[...]</a>

Menlo Park, Calif. — Scientists at the Department of Energy’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and Stanford University have made the first nickel oxide material that shows clear signs of superconductivity – the ability to transmit electrical current with no loss. Also known as a nickelate, it’s the first in a potential new family of unconventional superconductors that’s very similar to the copper oxides, or cuprates, whose discovery in 1986 raised hopes that superconductors could someday operate at close to room temperature and revolutionize electronic devices, power transmission and other technologies. Those similarities have scientists wondering if nickelates could also superconduct at relatively high temperatures. At the same time, the new material seems different from the cuprates in fundamental ways – for instance, it may not contain a type of magnetism that all the superconducting cuprates have – and this could overturn leading theories of how these unconventional superconductors work.

<p><em>"In 2016 Microchip/Atmel announced a completely new range of chips designed to replace their older ATmega and ATtiny ranges. The new ATtiny chips started with the 1-series ATtiny417 and ATtiny817, followed in 2018 by a lower cost series called the 0-series. The range now consists of a total of 25 parts. Until recently these new chips were not accessible to users of the Arduino IDE, because no Arduino core existed for them, and you couldn't program them using the existing ISP programmers. That changed a couple of months ago when Spence Konde released a megaTinyCore [1] for the new range, taking advantage of the work that Arduino have done to support their new ATmega4809-based boards. This article gives an introduction to the new ATtiny parts, and explains how you can now program them from the Arduino IDE."</em> <a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?KVM">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This project is without doubt the most complex I have undertaken, with sixteen IV-11 VFD tubes, two Arduino Mega cards, ten LED Neon light circuits, a servo, an electromagnet, two MAX6921AWI IC Chips, five DC power supplies, a HV power supply, two DC Volt meters, a DC Amp meter, FM stereo radio, 3W power amplifier, LCD screen, and keyboard. Apart from the above parts list, two software programs had to developed from scratch and finally the construction of the entire radio required about 200 hours of work. I decided to include this project onto the Instructables site not expecting members to reproduce this project in its entirety but rather to cherry pick the elements that where of interest to them. Two areas of particular interest to the site members may be the control of the 16 IV-11 VDF tubes using two MAX6921AWI chips and its associated wiring, and the communications between two Mega 2650 cards. The various components included into this project have been sourced locally, except the IV-11 tubes, and the MAX6921AWI chips both obtained on EBay. I wanted to bring back to life various items that would otherwise languish in boxes for years."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/SteamPunk-Radio/">[...]</a>

Everything you needed for this project: Arduino Nano Motor driver L298N Ultrasonic Sensor Module (HC-SR04) What is an ultrasonic levitator? Acoustic levitation (also: Acoustophoresis) is a method for suspending matter in a medium by using acoustic radiation pressure from intense sound waves in the medium. Sometimes sound waves at ultrasonic frequencies can be used to levitate objects, thus creating no sound heard by the human ear, such as was demonstrated at Otsuka Lab while others use audible frequencies. There are various ways of emitting the sound wave, from creating a wave underneath the object and reflecting it back to its source, to using a (transparent) tank to create a large acoustic field.
