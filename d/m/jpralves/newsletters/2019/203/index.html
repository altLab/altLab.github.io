<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1768, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Fourier">Joseph Fourier</a>. Este matemático e egiptólogo francês exerceu forte influência na física matemática através de sua Théorie analytique de la chaleur (1822; Teoria analítica do calor). Ele introduziu uma série matemática infinita para auxiliar na resolução de equações de condução. Esta técnica de análise permite que a função de qualquer variável seja expandida numa série de senos de múltiplos da variável, que é agora conhecida como a série de Fourier. As suas equações geraram muitas novas áreas de estudo na matemática e física, incluindo o ramo da óptica designado para ele, foram posteriormente aplicados a outros fenómenos naturais, como marés, clima e manchas solares.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1888, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_David_Birkhoff">George David Birkhoff</a>. Este matemático norte-americano foi responsável por ter formulado o teorema ergódico. Como o primeiro dinamista americano, Birkhoff começou onde Poincaré parou, ganhando distinção em 1913 com sua prova do Último Teorema Geométrico de Poincaré, um caso especial do problema dos três corpos. Embora principalmente especializado em geometria, ele descobriu novos métodos simbólicos. Ele viu além da teoria das oscilações, criou uma teoria rigorosa do comportamento ergódico e previu modelos dinâmicos para o caos. O seu teorema ergódico transformou a hipótese ergódica de Maxwell-Boltzmann da teoria cinética dos gases (à qual excepções são conhecidas) num princípio rigoroso através do uso da teoria da medida de Lebesgue. Ele também produziu um modelo matemático da gravidade.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1936, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Sze">Simon Min Sze</a>. Nascido em Nanjing, China cresceu em Taiwan. Ele ficou conhecido pelo seu trabalho em física e tecnologia de semicondutores, incluindo a sua descoberta com Dawon Kahng, do transístor de porta flutuante, hoje amplamente usado em dispositivos de memória de semicondutores não-voláteis. Ele escreveu e editou muitos livros, incluindo Physics of Semiconductor Devices, um dos textos mais citados no seu campo. Sze recebeu o Prémio J J Ebers em 1991 pelo seu trabalho em dispositivos electrónicos.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que a missão da NASA ao asteróide Bennu revelou as primeiras observações de perto de plumas de partículas em erupção na superfície de um asteróide. O Bennu também se revelou mais robusto do que o esperado, desafiando a equipa a alterar os seus planos voo e de recolha de amostras, devido ao terreno acidentado.</p>

<p>Hoje começou o Pixels Camp no Pavilhão Carlos Lopes em Lisboa. Nesta terceira edição inscreveram-se mais de 1300 participantes e existem centenas de Talks para ir. Existe também o Hackaton no qual estamos a participar assim como diversos passatempos. Neste evento de 3 dias iremos poder ainda vez o Quizshow, ver filmes como o "The Imitation Game", "Ready Player One", "Edge of Tomorrow" e "Source Code".</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. É apresentado o livro Microservice Architecture e a revista Hackspace Nº17.</p>

<p><em>"A NASA spacecraft that will return a sample of a near-Earth asteroid named Bennu to Earth in 2023 made the first-ever close-up observations of particle plumes erupting from an asteroid’s surface. Bennu also revealed itself to be more rugged than expected, challenging the mission team to alter its flight and sample collection plans, due to the rough terrain. Bennu is the target of NASA’s Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) mission, which began orbiting the asteroid on Dec. 31. Bennu, which is only slightly wider than the height of the Empire State Building, may contain unaltered material from the very beginning of our solar system. “The discovery of plumes is one of the biggest surprises of my scientific career,” said Dante Lauretta, OSIRIS-REx principal investigator at the University of Arizona, Tucson. “And the rugged terrain went against all of our predictions."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-mission-reveals-asteroid-has-big-surprises">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Enhanced tool chain accelerates development with modular software downloads and simplified drivers From basic device configuration to Real Time Operating System (RTOS)-based designs, 32-bit microcontroller (MCU) applications vary vastly in complexity and development models. To help developers simplify and scale designs, Microchip Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP) today announced a unified software framework with the release of MPLAB® Harmony version 3.0 (v3), extending support for SAM MCUs for the first time. The powerful development environment is progressively adding support across Microchip’s entire portfolio of 32-bit PIC and SAM MCUs, giving developers more options to meet different end application requirements. The new version also adds enhancements to streamline designs, such as royalty-free security software through a partnership with wolfSSL, as well as modular software downloads that allow designers to only download select portions of software based on the needs of an application. MPLAB Harmony v3 provides a unified platform with flexible choices spanning architectures, performance and application focus, enabling developers to learn and maintain a single environment on their computer. To support varying software development models from basic device configuration to Real Time Operating System (RTOS)-based applications, MPLAB Harmony version 3.0 relieves designers from having to download the entire software suite when they only need to use small elements or components of it."</em> <a href="https://microchip.com/en/pressreleasepage/mplab-harmony-version-3.0-unifies-software-development-framework">[...]</a>

<p><em>"There are high hopes that quantum computing’s tremendous processing power will someday unleash exponential advances in artificial intelligence. AI systems thrive when the machine learning algorithms used to train them are given massive amounts of data to ingest, classify and analyze. The more precisely that data can be classified according to specific characteristics, or features, the better the AI will perform. Quantum computers are expected to play a crucial role in machine learning, including the crucial aspect of accessing more computationally complex feature spaces – the fine-grain aspects of data that could lead to new insights. In a new Nature research paper entitled “Supervised learning with quantum enhanced feature spaces,” we describe developing and testing a quantum algorithm with the potential to enable machine learning on quantum computers in the near future. We’ve shown that as quantum computers become more powerful in the years to come, and their Quantum Volume increases, they will be able to perform feature mapping, a key component of machine learning, on highly complex data structures at a scale far beyond the reach of even the most powerful classical computers."</em> <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2019/03/machine-learning-quantum-advantage/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Odorless route to polymeric delivery systems is safer and cheaper An affordable, heavy metal- and odor-free method for making hollow polymer nanostructures has been designed by A*STAR researchers. These structures could find use as delivery systems for personal care products, drugs and agrochemicals. The use of hollow polymer nanostructures for carrying — and preserving the stability of — active ingredients, such as salicylic acid, vitamins, drugs and pesticides, is booming. These shells release cargo on demand in response to triggers such as water. Current manufacturing methods are imperfect, due to either cost, environmental or safety reasons.

<p><em>"Discovery allows scientists to look at how 2D materials move with ultrafast precision. Using a never-before-seen technique, scientists have found a new way to use some of the world’s most powerful X-rays to uncover how atoms move in a single atomic sheet at ultrafast speeds. The study, led by researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory and in collaboration with other institutions, including the University of Washington and DOE’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, developed a new technique called ultrafast surface X-ray scattering. This technique revealed the changing structure of an atomically thin two-dimensional crystal after it was excited with an optical laser pulse. “Extending [surface X-ray scattering] to do ultrafast science in single-layer materials represents a major technological advance that can show us a great deal about how atoms behave at surfaces and at the interfaces between materials.” — Argonne scientist Haidan Wen Unlike previous surface X-ray scattering techniques, this new method goes beyond providing a static picture of the atoms on a material’s surface to capture the motions of atoms on timescales as short as trillionths of a second after laser excitation. Static surface X-ray scattering and some time-dependent surface X-ray scattering can be performed at a synchrotron X-ray source, but to do ultrafast surface X-ray scattering the researchers needed to use the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) X-ray free-electron laser at SLAC."</em> <a href="https://www.anl.gov/article/ultrathin-and-ultrafast-scientists-pioneer-new-technique-for-twodimensional-material-analysis">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A Washington State University research team has developed a new way to separate carbon dioxide out of industrial processes — an important key in reducing industrial carbon emissions that contribute to global warming. Led by Min‑Kyu Song, assistant professor in the School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, and Ph.D. student Xiahui Zhang, the researchers developed a way to create hollow, nanorod‑shaped porous materials made of cobalt metal ions and organic molecules to separate the carbon dioxide in a way that works under real‑life conditions. They recently published their work in the journal, ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces. The work also includes researchers from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. Because of concerns about global warming and climate change, researchers have been working to develop ways to capture, store and use the carbon dioxide that fossil fuel industries emit during energy production. Carbon capture systems have to be able to selectively grab carbon dioxide out of the exhaust gases under the dynamic conditions that exist in a power plant."</em> <a href="https://news.wsu.edu/2019/02/26/new-separation-technique-lead-reduced-carbon-dioxide-emissions/">[...]</a>

A new way of measuring atomic-scale magnetic fields with great precision, not only up and down but sideways as well, has been developed by researchers at MIT. The new tool could be useful in applications as diverse as mapping the electrical impulses inside a firing neuron, characterizing new magnetic materials, and probing exotic quantum physical phenomena. The new approach is described today in the journal Physical Review Letters in a paper by graduate student Yi-Xiang Liu, former graduate student Ashok Ajoy, and professor of nuclear science and engineering Paola Cappellaro. The technique builds on a platform already developed to probe magnetic fields with high precision, using tiny defects in diamond called nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers. These defects consist of two adjacent places in the diamond’s orderly lattice of carbon atoms where carbon atoms are missing; one of them is replaced by a nitrogen atom, and the other is left empty."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/quantum-sensing-measures-magnetic-fields-0315">[...]</a>

If you tell them to “hang the mug on the hook by its handle,” they have to make that happen by doing a fairly extensive series of actions in a very precise order: noticing the mug on the table; visually locating the handle and recognizing that that’s how it should be picked up; grabbing it by its handle in a stable manner, using the right combination of fingers; visually locating the hook for hanging the mug; and finally, placing the cup on the hook. If you think about it, it’s actually quite a lot of stuff - and we humans can do it all without a moment’s hesitation, in the space of a couple of seconds. Meanwhile, for all the progress we’ve made with robots, they still barely have the skills of a two-year-old. Factory robots can pick up the same object over and over again, and some can even make some basic distinctions between objects, but they generally have trouble understanding a wide range of object shapes and sizes, or being able to move said objects into different poses or locations. That may be poised to change: researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) say that they’ve developed a new system that allows robots to do many different pick-and-place tasks, from hanging mugs to putting shoes on shelves, without having ever seen the objects they’re interacting with."</em> <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/news/robot-precisely-moves-objects-its-never-seen">[...]</a>

The researchers showed how the quantum process can outperform a classical version of the radar by a factor of 10, enabling the detection of objects that are faster, smaller, or further away – all while making the radar less detectable to targets. “We are applying technology developed for quantum computing to immediate, practical situations,” said Christopher Wilson, a professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo and principal investigator of the Engineered Quantum Systems Lab at IQC. “Our results show a promising improvement for radar, an important real-world application, using quantum illumination.” In the lab, Wilson’s team performed an experiment to directly compare the performance of a quantum protocol to a classical protocol. The researchers generated entangled photons using a device they designed to produce multiphoton entanglement of microwave light at frequencies near 5 GHz—the same frequency band as wireless communications used by cellphones and Wi-Fi connections. Next, they created a classical source of photons that, on the surface, replicated the signals produced by the quantum device, but without the entanglement."</em> <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/news/news/quantum-researchers-show-vast-new-potential-radar-technology">[...]</a>

The classical Hall effect is no longer as universal as it was thought to be, in a research paper published in Science this week, a group led by Prof Sir Andre Geim and Dr Denis Bandurin found that the Hall effect can even be significantly altered in graphene. The phenomenon was observed at room temperature – something that will have important implications for when making electronic devices from graphene.

Ceramic matrix composite (CMC) materials—tough, lightweight materials capable of withstanding high temperatures upwards of 2,000° F—are poised to replace metal alloy parts in the hottest zones of turbine engines, allowing for higher fuel efficiency and fewer emitted pollutants. Manufacturing CMC parts, however, has proven time consuming and expensive because of the complexities of creating advanced composite materials. Lowering the cost of production through supercomputer-aided optimization of CMC manufacturing processes could help overcome these hurdles. Using modeling and simulation, ORNL and Rolls Royce are developing tools to create a virtual sandbox for CMC manufacturers to test design parameters and identify strategies to make CMC production more reliable.

In electrochemical devices used for separations, the interfaces are complex.
