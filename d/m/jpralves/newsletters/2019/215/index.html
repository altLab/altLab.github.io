<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1773, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Young_(scientist)">Thomas Young</a>. Este físico e egiptólogo inglês reforçou a teoria ondulatória da luz com seu estudo da interferência da luz. Como estudante de medicina, descobriu como a forma das lentes do olho mudam para se focarem. Em 1801, ele reconheceu a causa do estigmatismo. Young demonstrou a natureza ondulatória da luz, polarização de luz, franjas de interferência e explicou as cores vistas em camadas finas, como bolhas de sabão. Ele associava o comprimento de onda com a cor da luz e a percepção do olho de qualquer cor como uma mistura de vermelho, azul e verde. O módulo de Young é o nome dados decorrente do seu trabalho com elasticidade. Ele também trabalhou medindo o tamanho das moléculas, a tensão superficial do líquido. Ele também foi um egiptólogo que ajudou a decifrar a Pedra de Roseta.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1831, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell">James Clerk Maxwell</a>. Este físico e matemático escocês fez pesquisas que uniram electricidade e magnetismo ao conceito do campo electromagnético. Em Londres, por volta de 1862, Maxwell calculou que a velocidade de propagação de um campo electromagnético é aproximadamente a velocidade da luz. Ele propôs que o fenómeno da luz é, portanto, um fenómeno electromagnético. As quatro equações diferenciais parciais, agora conhecidas como equações de Maxwell, apareceram pela primeira vez em forma totalmente desenvolvida em Electricity and Magnetism (1873). Ele morreu relativamente jovem; Algumas das teorias que ele avançou em física só foram conclusivamente provadas muito depois de sua morte. As ideias de Maxwell também abriram o caminho para a teoria da relatividade especial de Einstein e a teoria quântica.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1854, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Algernon_Parsons">Charles Algernon Parsons</a>. Este engenheiro britânico inventou uma turbina a vapor de múltiplos estágios que revolucionou a propulsão marítima (1884). Cada estágio foi projectado para controlar e maximizar a potência fornecida. Em 1891, ele projectou a sua turbina com um condensador para alimentar dínamos em estações geradoras eléctricas. Em 1897, usando a sua turbina para alimentar seu navio de 100 pés Turbinia, ele alcançou 35 nós. O primeiro navio a ser impulsionado por turbinas, com sua incrível velocidade, levou à construção de muitos navios de guerra movidos a turbina para a marinha britânica. Ele melhorou ainda mais a eficiência com um redutor mecânico para ligar o motor às hélices. Parsons também inventou um dispositivo para melhorar os fonógrafos, foi pioneiro na aviação e produziu um dispositivo antiderrapante para pneus de automóveis.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1903 - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willard_Harrison_Bennett">Willard Harrison Bennett</a>. Este físico norte-americano descobriu, em 1934, o efeito de pinça, um processo electromagnético que pode oferecer uma maneira de confinar magneticamente um plasma a temperaturas altas o suficiente para que ocorram reacções controladas de fusão nuclear. Ele propôs em 1936 o acelerador Van de Graaff, que mais tarde se tornou amplamente utilizado na pesquisa nuclear. Ele inventou um espectrómetro de massa de radiofrequência, desenvolvido em 1955. Como não exigia nenhum íman pesado, foi o primeiro lançado ao espaço para medir as massas de átomos. O Sputnik III levou o primeiro espectrómetro de massa R-F para o espaço. Foi o único instrumento espacial usado pelos russos e creditado a um inventor americano nas suas próprias publicações em língua russa.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nasciam, em 1911, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Wilhelm_M%C3%BCller">Erwin Wilhelm Müller</a> e <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Walter_Alvarez">Luis Walter Alvarez</a>. O primeiro foi um físico germano-americano que inventou o microscópio de emissão de campo (FIM), que forneceu ampliações superiores a um milhão. Pela primeira vez, foi possível tirar fotos de átomos individuais. Imagens das estruturas atómicas do tungsténio foram publicadas pela primeira vez em 1951 na revista Zeitschrift für Physik. Na MIF, uma voltagem de cerca de 10kV é aplicada a uma ponta de metal afiada, arrefecida abaixo de 50 kelvin numa atmosfera de hélio de baixa pressão. Átomos de gás são ionizados pelo forte campo eléctrico na vizinhança da ponta e repelidos perpendicularmente à superfície da ponta. Um detector desenha a distribuição espacial desses iões, dando uma ampliação da curvatura da superfície. O segundo foi um físico americano que recebeu o Prémio Nobel de Física em 1968 pelo trabalho que incluiu a descoberta de muitas partículas de ressonância (partículas subatómicas tendo vidas extremamente curtas e ocorrendo apenas em colisões nucleares de alta energia). Alvarez inventou uma distância de rádio e um indicador de direcção. Durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial, ele projectou um sistema de pouso para aeronaves e um sistema de radar para localizar aviões. Ele participou do desenvolvimento da bomba atómica no Laboratório Científico de Los Alamos (1944-45). Ele sugeriu a técnica para detonar o tipo de implosão de bomba atómica. Mais tarde, ele ajudou a desenvolver a câmara de bolhas de hidrogénio, usada para detectar partículas subatómicas. Esta pesquisa levou à descoberta de mais de 70 partículas elementares e resultou numa grande revisão das teorias nucleares.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1928, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Forbes_Nash_Jr.">John Forbes Nash Jr.</a>. Este matemático norte-americano fez contribuições fundamentais para a teoria dos jogos, geometria diferencial e o estudo de equações diferenciais parciais. O trabalho de Nash forneceu detalhes sobre os factores que governam o acaso e a tomada de decisões dentro de sistemas complexos encontrados na vida quotidiana. As suas teorias são amplamente utilizadas na economia. Actuando como Matemático de Pesquisa Sénior na Universidade de Princeton durante a parte posterior de sua vida, ele repartiu o Prémio Nobel de 1994 em Ciências Económicas com os teóricos dos jogos Reinhard Selten e John Harsanyi. Em 2015, ele também dividiu o Prémio Abel com Louis Nirenberg por seu trabalho sobre equações diferenciais parciais não-lineares. John Nash é a única pessoa a receber o Prémio Nobel em Ciências Económicas e o Prémio Abel.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que a SpaceX lançou com sucesso três satélites Canadianos RADARSAT (RCM). O Foguetão Falcon-9 foi lançado e após a sua missão voltou à Terra tendo sido recuperado com sucesso. Os três satélites lançados são do tipo C-Band SAR (Radar de Abertura Sintética) para observação terrestre. De entre as missões destes satélites o RCM fornecerão revisitas diárias ao vasto território e abordagens marítimas do Canadá, incluindo o Árctico, até 4 vezes por dia, bem como acesso diário a qualquer ponto de 90% da superfície da Terra. Estes satélites irão substituir os RADARSAT-2, lançados em 2007.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como um modelo 3D. É apresentado manual de operação do computador ENIAC.</p>

<p><em>"The Microsoft Alternatives project (MAlt) started a year ago to mitigate anticipated software license fee increases. MAlt’s objective is to put us back in control using open software. It is now time to present more widely this project and to explain how it will shape our computing environment. Background Over the years, CERN’s activities and services have increasingly relied on commercial software and solutions to deliver core functionalities, often leveraged by advantageous financial conditions based on the recognition of CERN’s status as an academic, non-profit or research institute. Once installed, well-spread and heavily used, the leverage used to attract CERN service managers to the commercial solutions tends to disappear and be replaced by licensing schemes and business models tuned for the private sector. Given the collaborative nature of CERN and its wide community, a high number of licenses are required to deliver services to everyone, and when traditional business models on a per-user basis are applied, the costs per product can be huge and become unaffordable in the long term."</em> <a href="https://home.cern/news/news/computing/microsoft-alternatives-project-malt">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/scientists-break-record-highest-temperature-superconductor">Scientists break record for highest-temperature superconductor</a></h2>

<p><em>"Experiment produces new material that can conduct electricity perfectly University of Chicago scientists are part of an international research team that has discovered superconductivity—the ability to conduct electricity perfectly—at the highest temperatures ever recorded. Using advanced technology at UChicago-affiliated Argonne National Laboratory, the team studied a class of materials in which they observed superconductivity at temperatures of about minus-23 degrees Celsius (minus-9 degrees Fahrenheit)—a jump of about 50 degrees compared to the previous confirmed record. Though the superconductivity happened under extremely high pressure, the result still represents a big step toward creating superconductivity at room temperature—the ultimate goal for scientists to be able to use this phenomenon for advanced technologies. The results were published May 22 in the journal Nature; Vitali Prakapenka, a research professor at the University of Chicago, and Eran Greenberg, a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Chicago, are co-authors of the research. Just as a copper wire conducts electricity better than a rubber tube, certain kinds of materials are better at becoming superconductive, a state defined by two main properties: The material offers zero resistance to electrical current and cannot be penetrated by magnetic fields. The potential uses for this are as vast as they are exciting: electrical wires without diminishing currents, extremely fast supercomputers and efficient magnetic levitation trains."</em> <a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/scientists-break-record-highest-temperature-superconductor">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/press/sphere_of_light.html">Probing Semiconductor Crystals with a Sphere of Light</a></h2>

<p><em>"Tohoku University researchers have developed a technique using a hollow sphere to measure the electronic and optical properties of large semiconducting crystals. The approach, published in the journal Applied Physics Express, improves on current photoluminescence spectroscopy techniques and could lead to energy savings for mass producers, and thus consumers, of power devices. Semiconducting crystals are used to make electronic devices like microprocessor chips and transistors. Manufacturers need to be able to detect crystal defects and test their energy conversion efficiency. One way to do this is to measure their 'internal quantum efficiency', or their ability to generate photons from electrons excited by an electric current or an excitation laser. Currently available methods limit the sample size that can be tested at a time."</em> <a href="http://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/press/sphere_of_light.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/news/rcn/131242/en">A step towards fully electric ferries</a></h2>

<p><em>"Hybrid and electric vessels are under the spotlight lately, thanks to intensified efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions from global shipping, a significant source of CO2 and other pollutants. There are already several offerings of such green ships in Europe, and a Danish operator is ready to pave the way for the widespread use of fully electric powered vessels in the ferry sector. Supported by the EU-funded E-ferry project, project partner Aeroe (Ærø) Kommune’s vessel will cover distances of over 20 NM between charges. The novel all-electric ferry is set to have the largest battery pack installed at sea. A news item on ‘Passenger Ship Technology’ states that the new vessel is “likely to be the first electric ferry to have no emergency back-up generator.” It adds: “Creating this E-ferry prototype Ellen, due for delivery in May, involved designing, building and demonstrating a fully electric-powered ‘green’ ferry which can sail without CO2 emissions.” The same news item notes that the battery system of the vessel is divided into 20 different units. Each unit is connected to separate converters that control the energy output."</em> <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/news/rcn/131242/en">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Rice lab claims a viable competitor for copper in 5G wireless and other applications Antennas made of carbon nanotube films are just as efficient as copper for wireless applications, according to researchers at Rice University’s Brown School of Engineering. They’re also tougher, more flexible and can essentially be painted onto devices. The Rice lab of chemical and biomolecular engineer Matteo Pasquali tested antennas made of “shear-aligned” nanotube films. The researchers discovered that not only were the conductive films able to match the performance of commonly used copper films, they could also be made thinner to better handle higher frequencies. The results detailed in Applied Physics Letters advance the lab’s previous work on antennas based on carbon nanotube fibers. The lab’s shear-aligned antennas were tested at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) facility in Boulder, Colorado, by lead author Amram Bengio, who carried out the research and wrote the paper while earning his doctorate in Pasquali’s lab."</em> <a href="https://news.rice.edu/2019/06/10/antennas-of-flexible-nanotube-films-an-alternative-for-electronics-2/">[...]</a>

Yet that happened at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory recently, when a novel magnet half the size of a spent toilet tissue roll usurped the title of "world's strongest magnetic field" from the metal titan that had held it for two decades. And, its makers say, we ain't seen nothing yet: By packing an exceptionally high-field magnet into a coil you could pack in a purse, MagLab scientists and engineers have shown a way to build and use electromagnets that are stronger, smaller and more versatile than ever before. Their work is outlined in an article published today in the journal Nature. "We are really opening a new door," said MagLab engineer Seungyong Hahn, the mastermind behind the new magnet and a professor at the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering."</em> <a href="https://nationalmaglab.org/news-events/news/lbc-project-world-record-magnetic-field">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A team at Osaka University has invented a new process for creating high-precision sensing devices that respond to the presence of hydrogen gas. By carefully controlling the deposition of metallic nanoparticles on a silicon surface, the researchers were able to create a sensor that can detect low levels of hydrogen on the basis of changes in electrical current. This research may have important benefits as part of a switch to hydrogen-based fuels, which could power the zero-emission cars of the future and help fight anthropogenic climate change. To fabricate a hydrogen sensor, the researchers deposited metallic palladium on a silicon substrate. The deposited palladium forms nanoparticles on the substrate, and they act like tiny islands that are excellent conductors of electricity, but, because they do not form a connected network, the current across the device is very small. However, when hydrogen atoms are present, they are absorbed into the palladium nanoparticles, increasing volume of the nanoparticles, and then bridge the gaps between the islands."</em> <a href="https://resou.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/research/2019/20190521_3">[...]</a>

Fine control of polarity can result in the design of new quantum devices. Future applications of nanomaterials depend on our ability to understand their characteristics at the atomic scale and to modulate them at will. Polarity appears to play an important role in determining the physical and morphological properties of semiconductor nanostructures, thus researchers are studying how to control or change it. Because of the way atoms are arranged in crystal structures, electromagnetic charges are locally separated. As a consequence, if we look at the crystal along specific directions, we can observe oppositely-charged ionic couples, which are called dumbbells because of their shape."</em> <a href="https://icn2.cat/en/news/4315-tune-in-to-future-polarity-quantum-devices">[...]</a>

The initial focus of tensor network was on quantum particles restricted to a lattice, just as they occur in crystals for example, or in the quantum registers of future quantum computers.

Cryptography involves jumbling up messages according to a code, or key, that has too many combinations for even very powerful computers to try out. But quantum computers have an advantage.

<p><em>"A stepwise transfer of energy through the different components of the nanostructure—from light-excited semiconducting nanocrystals to a protein to an atomically thin semiconductor—boosts its response to light, showing promise for solar cell applications To absorb incoming sunlight, plants and certain kinds of bacteria rely on a light-harvesting protein complex containing molecules called chromophores. This complex funnels solar energy to the photosynthetic reaction center, where it is converted into chemical energy for metabolic processes. Inspired by this found-in-nature architecture, scientists from the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Brookhaven National Laboratory and Stony Brook University (SBU) have assembled a nanohybrid structure that contains both biologically derived (biotic) and inorganic (abiotic) materials. They combined a light-harvesting protein from a cyanobacteria, semiconducting nanocrystals (quantum dots), and a two-dimensional (2-D) semiconducting transition metal only one atomic layer thick. Described in a paper published on April 29 in ACS Photonics—a journal of the American Chemical Society (ACS)—this nanostructure could be used to improve the efficiency with which solar cells harvest energy from the sun. “Today’s best solar panels can convert nearly 23 percent of the sunlight they absorb into electricity, but on average, their efficiency ranges between 15 and 18 percent,” said corresponding author Mircea Cotlet, a materials scientist in the Soft and Bio Nanomaterials Group at Brookhaven Lab’s Center for Functional Nanomaterials (CFN)—a DOE Office of Science User Facility."</em> <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=115556">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A Japanese shrub’s unique foliage arrangement leads botanists to rethink plant growth models To the untrained eye, plants may appear to grow rather impulsively, popping out leaves at random to create one big green jumble. Take a closer look, though, and you’ll find that a few curiously regular patterns pop up all over the natural world, from the balanced symmetry of bamboo shoots to the mesmerizing spirals of succulents. In fact, these patterns are consistent enough that cold, hard math can predict organic growth fairly well. One assumption that has been central to the study of phyllotaxis, or leaf patterns, is that leaves protect their personal space. Based on the idea that already existing leaves have an inhibitory influence on new ones, giving off a signal to prevent others from growing nearby, scientists have created models that can successfully recreate many of nature’s common designs. The ever-fascinating Fibonacci sequence, for example, shows up in everything from sunflower seed arrangements to nautilus shells to pine cones."</em> <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/decoding-mathematical-secrets-plants-stunning-leaf-patterns-180972367/">[...]</a>

Since I own a crappy dual extruder printer I thought I would make it possible to generate the letter and brick separately so they can be printed with distinct colours. This has the side effect of being able to generate an embossed brick with adjustable letter inset depth. You can make the colour letter flush with the top of the brick so it's a non-protruding inlay by making the letter height the same as the embossed inset. You can also try no inset and switching filament on the first letter layer to use a regular machine to create the 2 colour design."</em> <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3122711">[...]</a>

Introduction On several systems that use time and date to perform certain tasks, it is critical to use real-time clock chips. But one of the big problems is that it needs a battery to, keep the time and date count when the system is off. On the computer, for example, we have a Real Time Clock and when the battery is low voltage, the time and date are displayed with wrong values. So, to solve this problem in projects, we can monitor the battery voltage. Thus, when the battery is below a limit value, the system will generate an alarm in order to perform the exchange."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/silicioslab/real-time-clock-battery-monitoring-system-793e69">[...]</a>
