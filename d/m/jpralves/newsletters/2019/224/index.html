<p>Faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1892, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_de_Broglie">Louis de Broglie</a>. Este Físico francês ficou conhecido pelas suas pesquisas sobre a teoria quântica e pela sua descoberta da natureza ondulatória dos electrões. Em 1923, ele argumentou que desde que a luz possa ser vista em algumas condições como partículas (efeito fotoeléctrico) e outras vezes como ondas (difracção), devemos considerar que a matéria tem a mesma ambiguidade de possuir ambas as propriedades de partículas e ondas. Por isso, ele recebeu o Prémio Nobel de Física de 1929.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que Júpiter foi atingido por algo tão grande que foi observado da Terra. Um astrónomo amador, Ethan Chappel, capturou algo espectacular com o seu telescópio de quintal na quarta-feira, quando gravou um flash brilhante na superfície de Júpiter. A sequência capturada mostra a mancha branca vista no lado inferior esquerdo do planeta nas imagens acima em 7 de Agosto. Embora ainda tenha que ser confirmado por um segundo observador, parece um grande asteróide colidindo com o planeta gigante de gás. O flash é breve e desaparece rapidamente, aumentando a ideia de que provavelmente foi causado por um impacto.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker.</p>

<p><em>"An amateur astronomer caught something spectacular with a backyard telescope Wednesday when he recorded a bright flash on the surface of Jupiter. The biggest planet in the solar system routinely delivers stunning pictures, like those snapped by NASA's Juno spacecraft, but the unexpected flash has astronomers excited at the possibility of a meteor impact. Ethan Chappel pointed his telescope at the gas giant planet at just the right time, capturing the white spot seen on the lower left side of the planet in the above images on Aug. 7. While it has yet to be confirmed by a second observer, it looks like a large asteroid crashing into the gas giant planet. The flash is brief and quickly fades away, boosting the idea that it was likely caused by an impact.

<p><em>"If contemplating the vast size of astronomical objects makes you feel rather puny and insignificant, then this new discovery will make you feel positively infinitesimal. It’s almost impossible to imagine an object this large: a super massive black hole that’s 40 billion times more massive than our Sun. But there it is, sitting in the center of a super-giant elliptical galaxy called Holmberg 15A. Holmberg 15A is about 700 million light years away, in the center of the Abell 85 galaxy cluster. This behemoth has been in astronomers’ cross-hairs before.

<p><em>"Transparent electrodes are a critical component of solar cells and electronic displays. To collect electricity in a solar cell or inject electricity for a display, you need a conductive contact, like a metal, but you also need to be able to let light in (for solar cells) or out (for displays). Metal is opaque, so the current techniques use metal oxides, most often indium tin oxide — a near-critical rare earth metal — as the conductive contact. Because supplies of this rare earth metal are limited, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) researchers have turned to ordered metal nanowire meshes that provide high transmissivity (due to the small diameters of the nanowires), high electrical connectivity (due to the many contact points in the mesh) and use more common elements. The research appears in the journal Soft Matter. The nanowire arrays also have applications for optical metamaterials — composite materials usually made of metals and dielectrics — that have unique optical properties not found in nature."</em> <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/news/nanowire-arrays-could-improve-solar-cells">[...]</a>

<p><em>"An international team of scientists, including a professor of chemistry from the University of Bristol, has worked out a way to improve energy storage devices called supercapacitors, by designing a new class of detergents chemically related to laxatives. Their paper, published today in the journal Nature Materials, explains why these detergents, called ionic liquids, are better electrolytes than current materials and can improve supercapacitors. Currently, aqueous and organic electrolytes are used, but more recently, researchers and manufacturers have been testing ionic liquids instead to boost performance. Although ionic liquids are salts, at room temperature they are surprisingly not crystalline solids - as their name suggests they are in fact liquids. This gives ionic liquids numerous advantages over conventional electrolytes because they are stable, non-flammable, and often much more environmentally friendly. To explore the exciting potential offered by ionic liquids for emerging electrochemical technologies the authors designed a new set of highly efficient detergent-like ionic liquid electrolytes and explained how they work at electrode surfaces."</em> <a href="https://bristol.ac.uk/news/2019/august/supercapacitors-laxatives.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Engineers at the University of California San Diego have developed the thinnest optical device in the world—a waveguide that is three layers of atoms thin. The work is a proof of concept for scaling down optical devices to sizes that are orders of magnitude smaller than today’s devices. It could lead to the development of higher density, higher capacity photonic chips. Researchers published their findings Aug. 12 in Nature Nanotechnology. “Fundamentally, we demonstrate the ultimate limit for how thin an optical waveguide can be built,” said senior author Ertugrul Cubukcu, a professor of nanoengineering and electrical engineering at UC San Diego. The new waveguide measures about six angstroms thin—that is more than 10,000 times thinner than a typical optical fiber and about 500 times thinner than on-chip optical waveguides in integrated photonic circuits."</em> <a href="http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/news/news_releases/release.sfe?id=2847">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/801725">Printing flattens polymers, improving electrical and optical properties</a></h2>

<p><em>"Researchers have found a way to use polymer printing to stretch and flatten twisted molecules so that they conduct electricity better. A team led by chemical and biomolecular engineers from the University of Illinois report their findings in the journal Science Advances. Conjugated polymers are formed by the union of electron-rich molecules along a backbone of alternating single and double chemical bonds. The conjunction allows electricity to travel very quickly through a polymer, making it highly desirable for use in electrical and optical applications. This mode of transporting charges works so well that conjugated polymers are now poised to compete with silicon materials, the researchers said. However, these polymers tend to contort into twisted spirals when they join, severely impeding charge transport."</em> <a href="https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/801725">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A Rice University lab wants its products to look sharp, even at the nanoscale. Its latest creation is right on target. The Rice lab of materials scientist Pulickel Ajayan has created unique two-dimensional flakes with two distinct personalities: molybdenum diselenide on one side of a sharp divide with rhenium diselenide on the other. From all appearances, the two-toned material likes it that way, growing naturally — though under tight conditions — in a chemical vapor deposition furnace. The material is a 2D transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructure, a crystal with more than one chemical component. That’s not unusual in itself, but the sharp zigzag boundary between elements in the material reported in the American Chemical Society journal Nano Letters is unique."</em> <a href="http://news.rice.edu/2019/08/12/sharp-meets-flat-in-tunable-2d-material/">[...]</a>

DGIST announced that Research Fellow Jae Young Kim in the Department of Robotics Engineering and Chair-professor Dae Won Moon’s team developed a technology that can analyze experiment samples without any preparation processing. Due to its ability to obtain high-resolution mass spectrometric images without an experimental environment using ‘continuous wave laser’1, the technology is expected to be applied widely in the precise medicine and medical diagnosis fields. Many advance preparations are needed for the mass spectrometric imaging of biometric samples using ‘specimen,’ which thinly cut an object to analyze.

In a study, researchers exploited an interaction between light and sound waves to suppress the scattering of light from material defects – which could lead to improved fiber optic communication. Their findings are published in the journal Optica. Light waves scatter when they encounter obstacles, be it a crack in a window or a tiny flaw in a fiber optic cable. Much of that light scatters out of the system, but some of it scatters back toward the source in a phenomenon called backscattering, the researchers said. “There is no such thing as a perfect material,” said mechanical science and engineering professor Gaurav Bahl, who led the study."</em> <a href="https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/801819">[...]</a>

Artificial “molecular assemblers” performing “mechanosynthesis” have been proposed as a new paradigm in chemistry and nanofabrication.

<p><em>"Dead or alive, left-spinning or right-spinning - in the quantum world particles such as the famous analogy of Schrödinger's cat can be all these things at the same time. An international team, including researchers from several leading American universities, together with experts from Forschungszentrum Jülich, have now succeeded in transforming 20 entangled quantum bits into such a state of superposition. The generation of such atomic Schrödinger cat states is regarded as an important step in the development of quantum computers which could outperform classical computers in solving certain tasks. The results were published in Science last Friday. In 1935, the physicist Erwin Schrödinger put forward the thought experiment with the quantum cat, in which the cat is enclosed in a box together with a radioactive sample, a detector and a lethal amount of poison. If the radioactive material decays, the detector triggers an alarm and the poison is released."</em> <a href="https://www.fz-juelich.de/SharedDocs/Pressemitteilungen/UK/EN/2019/2019-08-13-schroedingers_cat_with_20_qubits.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"As part of a Circular Economy for electric vehicle battery systems, as the number of such vehicles increases rapidly, Professor James Marco in the labthe need to find the best way to reuse and recycle vehicle batteries becomes just as intense. Now researchers at WMG, University of Warwick, have found a way not just to recycle those used batteries, but repurpose them as small energy storage systems (ESS) for off grid locations in developing countries or isolated communities. The repurposed units, each containing approximately 2kWh of energy capacity, will be able to power a small shop, a farm holding, or multiple residential homes. WMG’s Professor James Marco who was lead researcher on the project said: “When an electric vehicle’s battery reaches the end of its useful life it is by no means massively depleted. It has simply reached the end of its useful life in a vehicle. It is generally accepted that an EV battery has reached end of life when its capacity drops to 80% of a fresh battery."</em> <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/researchers_convert_used/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Overuse of electronic devices is no “LOL” — laughing out loud — matter, according to researchers, who suggest that excessive interaction with e-devices may be related to weaker activity in areas of the brain that are key to understanding scientific texts. In a study that used neuroimaging to explore brain activity, the researchers found the frequent e-device use — such as texting on a smart phone or reading on a tablet — was negatively correlated with activity in brain areas that are critical for integrating multiple sources of information, the researchers said. Expository texts, such as articles in a science textbook, typically use inter-connected information, which means that material in one part of the text must be linked to information found in another part of the text, especially when reading for the purpose of understanding inter-connected concepts. “In this case, if people use electronic devices excessively on a daily basis, that could possibly impair their ability to acquire hierarchical order — or structure — of scientific concepts,” said Ping Li, associate director emeritus of Penn State’s Institute for CyberScience and professor of psychology, linguistics, and information sciences and technology. Li added that readers often must integrate many pieces of information that are arranged in a hierarchy in the article. Just like a person exercises to strengthen certain muscles, the researchers suggest that by using certain areas of the brain — and ignoring others — those sections may become stronger, or weaker."</em> <a href="https://news.psu.edu/story/583253/2019/08/12/research/brains-trained-e-devices-may-struggle-understand-scientific-info">[...]</a>

The science behind galaxy formation has remained a puzzle for decades, but a University of Arizona-led team of scientists is one step closer to finding answers thanks to supercomputer simulations. Observing real galaxies in space can only provide snapshots in time, so researchers who want to study how galaxies evolve over billions of years have to revert to computer simulations.

If you learn to develop embedded code, e.g. using the Arduino IDE, you find plenty of small example programs. It is helpful to get things started quickly, but as soon as your project begins to grow, help related to software design is rare. In contrast, when you learn software development for desktop applications, project structures and software design is an integral part of the learning process."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/LuckyResistor/guide-to-modular-firmware-6c5409">[...]</a>
