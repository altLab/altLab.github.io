<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1802 - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beno%C3%AEt_Fourneyron">Benoît Fourneyron</a>. Este engenheiro francês ficou conhecido por ter inventado a turbina de água. Em 1827, aos 25 anos, Fourneyron, introduziu uma turbina de reacção que canalizava água através de uma câmara fechada, equipada com um anel interno de lâminas-guia fixas. Estas lâminas-guia desviam a água para fora contra as palhetas em movimento de um "corredor". As palhetas desse corredor externo eram curvadas na direcção oposta às lâminas-guia internas fixas, revertendo a direcção do fluxo de água dentro do dispositivo e criando uma força reactiva. A patente de Fourneyron descreveu sua invenção como "uma roda de pressão universal e contínua ou turbina hidráulica". Ele morreu em Paris e ficou conhecido como "pai da turbina"</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1815, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Weierstrass">Karl Weierstrass</a>. Este matemático alemão ficou conhecido como o "pai da análise moderna", pois seu rigor na análise levou à moderna teoria das funções e foi considerado um dos maiores professores de matemática de todos os tempos. Ele estava a fazer pesquisas matemáticas enquanto professor do ensino médio, quando em 1854 publicou um artigo sobre funções abelianas no famoso Crelle Journal. O artigo impressionou tanto a comunidade matemática que ele recebeu um doutorado honorário e, em 1856, ele tinha um compromisso na Universidade de Berlim. Em 1871, ele demonstrou que existem funções contínuas num intervalo que não têm derivadas nesse intervalo.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1828, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Swan">Joseph Swan</a>. Este cientista, químico, físico e inventor inglês, nascido em Sunderland, Yorkshire, produziu uma lâmpada incandescente eléctrica. Ele iniciou estes testes na década de 1840 e obteve uma patente no Reino Unido cobrindo um vácuo parcial, lâmpada incandescente de filamento de carbono em 1860. As lâmpadas iniciais de Swan proporcionavam baixa emissão de luz, tinham vida curta e eram operadas a partir de células de bateria. A operação de baixa tensão exigia uma corrente de filamento relativamente alta que exigia que a fonte de energia fosse co-localizada perto da lâmpada Swan. Ele também abordou o problema do desbotamento da impressão fotográfica e, em meados da década de 1850, alguns começaram a experimentar uma solução usando carbono, aperfeiçoando e patenteando o processo em 1864. Assim, Swan inventou a chapa fotográfica seca, uma importante melhoria na fotografia.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1835,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_von_Baeyer">Adolf von Baeyer</a>. Este químico alemão sintetizou o índigo (1880) e formulou sua estrutura (1883). Ele recebeu o Prémio Nobel de Química em 1905 "em reconhecimento aos seus serviços no avanço da química orgânica e da indústria química, através do seu trabalho em corantes orgânicos e compostos hidro-aromáticos". Baeyer também trabalhou em acetileno e poli-acetileno, e daí derivou a famosa teoria das deformações dos anéis de carbono de Baeyer. Ele estudou benzeno e terpeno cíclico. Nesse contexto, foi descoberta a oxidação de cetonas de Baeyer-Villiger por meio de ácidos. O seu trabalho sobre peróxidos orgânicos e compostos de ozónio e sobre a conexão entre constituição e cor despertou interesse especial.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1847, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Ferraris">Galileo Ferraris</a>. Este Físico italiano estudou óptica, acústica e vários campos da electrotécnica, mas sua descoberta mais importante foi o campo magnético rotativo. Ele produziu o campo com dois electroímanes em planos perpendiculares, e cada um deles forneceu uma corrente que estava 90º fora de fase. Isto poderia induzir uma corrente num rotor de cobre incorporado, produzindo um motor alimentado por corrente alterna. Ele produziu o seu primeiro motor de indução (com 4 pólos) em 1885. Os seus princípios agora são aplicados na maioria dos motores AC de hoje, no entanto ele recusou-se a patentear a sua invenção e preferiu colocá-la ao serviço de todos.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1925, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Pople">John Pople</a>. Este matemático e químico britânico partilhou (com Walter Kohn) o Prémio Nobel de Química de 1998 pelo seu trabalho em metodologia computacional para estudar a mecânica quântica de moléculas, as suas propriedades e como elas agem juntas em reacções químicas. Usando as leis fundamentais da mecânica quântica de Schrödinger, ele desenvolveu um programa de computador que, quando fornecido com detalhes de uma molécula ou reacção química, produz uma descrição das propriedades dessa molécula ou como uma reacção química pode ocorrer - frequentemente usada para ilustrar ou explicar os resultados de diferentes tipos de experiências. Pople forneceu o seu programa de computador GAUSSIAN para investigadores (publicado pela primeira vez em 1970). Mais desenvolvido, agora é usado por milhares de químicos em todo o mundo.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1926, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narinder_Singh_Kapany">Narinder Singh Kapany</a>. Este físico índio-americano é amplamente reconhecido como o pai da fibra óptica. Ele usou o termo fibra óptica para a tecnologia que transmite luz através de finos fios de vidro em dispositivos de endoscopia, linhas telefónicas de alta capacidade que mudaram os mundos médico, de comunicações e de negócios. Enquanto crescia em Dehradun, no norte da Índia, um professor o informou que a luz viajava apenas em linha recta. Ele encarou isso como um desafio e fez do estudo da luz a sua vida profissional, inicialmente no Imperial College, em Londres. Em 2 de Janeiro de 1954, a Nature publicou o seu relatório de transmissão bem-sucedida de imagens através de pacotes de fibra óptica.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1930, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Collins_(astronaut)">Michael Collins</a>. Este astronauta dos EUA, nascido em Roma, Itália, era o piloto do módulo de comando Apollo 11 em órbita, enquanto Neil Armstrong e Edwin Aldrin caminhavam na Lua. Seleccionado como astronauta da NASA em outubro de 1963, a primeira missão de Collins foi como piloto reserva da Gemini VII. Como piloto da missão Gemini X de três dias, lançada em 18 de Julho de 1966, ele atracou com o veículo-alvo Agena lançado separadamente e fez duas caminhadas espaciais, recuperando equipamentos de detecção de micrometeoritos da Agena. Na primeira missão de aterragem lunar da Apollo 11, lançada em 16 de Julho de 1969, ele permaneceu em órbita enquanto Armstrong e Aldrin percorriam a superfície da Lua. A sua habilidade, a recuperar a Eagle e devolver o orbitador à Terra, era vital para o sucesso da missão.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou comemoram-se os 50 anos desde que foi feita a primeira ligação entre computadores na ARPANET, a rede percursora da Internet. A troca de pacotes da ARPANET foi baseada em projetos do cientista britânico Donald Davies e Lawrence Roberts do Lincoln Laboratory. Inicialmente, a ARPANET consistia em quatro processadores de mensagens de interface (IMPs) localizados na  Universidade da Califórnia em Los Angeles, o Augmentation Research Center do Stanford Research Institute, a Universidade da Califórnia em Santa Barbara e no Departamento de Ciência da Computação da Universidade de Utah.
A primeira mensagem na ARPANET foi enviada pelo programador da UCLA Charles S Kline às 22:30 do dia 29 de Outubro, do Boelter Hall do campus para o computador SDS 940 do Stanford Research Institute.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou foi lançada a nova versão da Distribuição Fedora. O Fedora 31 esteve em desenvolvimento nos últimos seis meses e, após um atraso de uma semana, finalmente chegou com alguns dos mais recentes e melhores softwares de código aberto e tecnologias GNU / Linux, incluindo o ambiente de desktop GNOME 3.34, o Kernel Linux 5.3 , Glibc 2.30, Python 3 e Node.js 12. Adicionalmente esta é a primeira versão que não inclui suporte para equipamentos de 32-bits.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. É apresentada a revista MagPI Nº87 de Novembro e o livro "Get Started with Raspberry Pi".</p>

<p><em>"The first-ever computer-to-computer link was established on ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network), the precursor to the Internet, on October 29, 1969. Originally funded by ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency), now DARPA, within the United States Department of Defense, ARPANET was to be used for projects at universities and research laboratories in the US. The packet switching of the ARPANET was based on designs by British scientist Donald Davies and Lawrence Roberts of the Lincoln Laboratory. Initially, ARPANET consisted of four interface message processors (IMPs) at: - the University of California, Los Angeles, which had an SDS Sigma 7 as the first computer attached to it; - the Stanford Research Institute's Augmentation Research Center, where Douglas Engelbart is credited with creating the NLS (oN-Line System) hypertext system, with an SDS 940 that ran NLS being the first host attached; - the University of California, Santa Barbara with the Culler-Fried Interactive Mathematics Center's IBM 360/75 running OS/MVT being the machine attached; - and at the University of Utah's Computer Science Department, which had a DEC PDP-10 running TENEX. The first message on the ARPANET was sent by UCLA student programmer Charles S Kline at 10:30 pm on October 29, from the campus’ Boelter Hall to the Stanford Research Institute's SDS 940 host computer. The message text was meant to be the word “login,” but only the L and O were transmitted before the system crashed."</em> <a href="https://www.edn.com/electronics-blogs/edn-moments/4399541/ARPANET-establishes-1st-computer-to-computer-link--October-29--1969">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Samsung continues network leadership with the introduction of industry’s first 5G integrated radio for 28GHz, expanding its 5G portfolio Samsung Electronics today announced at MWC Los Angeles 2019 its new 5G New Radio (NR) Access Unit (AU) supporting 28GHz spectrum. This new AU brings together a radio, antenna and digital unit into one compact box, making it the industry’s first integrated radio for mmWave spectrum, compliant to the 3GPP NR standard. The new Access Unit is on display at the Samsung Booth (South Hall #1228). Earlier this year, Samsung Networks successfully deployed its first-generation 5G NR radio base stations in the U.S. with separated radio and digital units (RU-DU separated radio). By integrating these RU-DU technologies with 1,024 antenna elements for mmWave spectrum into one compact box, the new AU can be more easily installed on streetlight poles and building walls, providing operators a faster, simplified way to build out 5G networks. The AU is able to deliver an industry-leading capacity of 10Gbps throughput, enabling operators to deliver higher 5G NR speeds to more users."</em> <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-unveils-new-5g-nr-integrated-radio-supporting-28ghz-at-mwc-la-2019">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/update/31-oct-2019/detection-of-argon-40-lunar-exosphere">Detection of Argon-40 in the lunar exosphere</a></h2>

<p><em>"Planetary scientists prefer to call the thin gaseous envelope around the Moon as the ‘Lunar exosphere’ since it is so tenuous that the gas atoms very rarely collide with each other. While the Earth’s atmosphere near the mean sea level contains ~1019 atoms in a cubic centimetre of volume, the lunar exosphere contains ~ 104 to 106atoms in a cubic centimetre. Argon-40 (40Ar), which is one of the isotopes of the noble gas Argon, is an important constituent of the lunar exosphere. It originates from the radioactive disintegration of Potassium-40 (40K), which has a half-life of ~1.2 X 109 years. The radioactive 40K nuclide, which is present deep below the lunar surface, disintegrates to 40Ar, which, in turn, diffuses through the intergranular space and makes way up to the lunar exosphere through seepages and faults. The Chandra’s Atmospheric Composition Explorer-2 (CHACE-2) payload aboard the Chandrayaan-2 orbiter, is a neutral mass spectrometer-based payload which can detect constituents in the lunar neutral exosphere in the range of 1-300 amu (atomic mass unit)."</em> <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/update/31-oct-2019/detection-of-argon-40-lunar-exosphere">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Microfluidic systems have the power to revolutionize medicine, energy, electronics and even space exploration. But the sheer size of the external equipment required for controlling these quarter-sized devices has limited their use in portable, wearable technologies. Now Northwestern University researchers are pushing microfluidics closer to reaching its true potential. In a recent study, the researchers discovered how to pre-program the devices’ network structures in a way that controls how fluids flow and mix throughout the micropipes. The result? A step toward smartly designed microfluidic systems that behave like a computer chip without relying on external components."</em> <a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2019/10/pre-programmed-microfluidic-systems-offer-new-control-capabilities/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The process could work on the gas at any concentrations, from power plant emissions to open air. A new way of removing carbon dioxide from a stream of air could provide a significant tool in the battle against climate change. The new system can work on the gas at virtually any concentration level, even down to the roughly 400 parts per million currently found in the atmosphere. Most methods of removing carbon dioxide from a stream of gas require higher concentrations, such as those found in the flue emissions from fossil fuel-based power plants. A few variations have been developed that can work with the low concentrations found in air, but the new method is significantly less energy-intensive and expensive, the researchers say. The technique, based on passing air through a stack of charged electrochemical plates, is described in a new paper in the journal Energy and Environmental Science, by MIT postdoc Sahag Voskian, who developed the work during his PhD, and T. Alan Hatton, the Ralph Landau Professor of Chemical Engineering."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/mit-engineers-develop-new-way-remove-carbon-dioxide-air-1025">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A joint research team from Google Inc., NASA Ames Research Center, and the Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory has demonstrated that a quantum computer can outperform a classical computer at certain tasks, a feat known as quantum supremacy. Quantum computers use the laws of quantum mechanics and units known as qubits to greatly increase the threshold at which information can be transmitted and processed. Whereas traditional “bits” have a value of either 0 or 1, qubits are encoded with values of both 0 and 1, or any combination thereof, allowing for a vast number of possibilities for storing data. While still in their early stages, quantum systems have the potential to be exponentially more powerful than today’s leading classical computing systems and promise to revolutionize research in materials, chemistry, high-energy physics, and across the scientific spectrum. The team’s results, published today in Nature, provide a proof of concept for quantum supremacy and establish a baseline comparison of time-to-solution and energy consumption. “This achievement of quantum supremacy is a testament to the strength of American innovation, and DOE’s Labs are helping lead the way in this groundbreaking area of research,” DOE Under Secretary for Science Paul Dabbar said."</em> <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/news/quantum-supremacy-milestone-harnesses-ornl-summit-supercomputer">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Stretchy, see-through, silver nanowire sheet combines optical transparency with excellent electrical conductivity. A submicrometer-thin mesh of silver nanowires—that is transparent to light, highly electrically conductive, flexible and stretchable, and simple to make—has been developed by researchers at KAUST. The material could find use in flexible electronic displays, sensors, solar cells or even incubators for newborn babies. “The idea came to me when I was in the hospital with my son, who was in an incubator,” recalls Atif Shamim. “I worried about the exposure of the babies to all the electromagnetic radiation in the room,” he says. While opaque metals are well known for their electrical conductivity, serving as blocks to electromagnetic radiation, they are generally not transparent or stretchable."</em> <a href="https://discovery.kaust.edu.sa/en/article/887/baby-steps-for-transparent-electronics">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Passive device relies on a layer of material that blocks incoming sunlight but lets heat radiate away. Imagine a device that can sit outside under blazing sunlight on a clear day, and without using any power cool things down by more than 23 degrees Fahrenheit (13 degrees Celsius). It almost sounds like magic, but a new system designed by researchers at MIT and in Chile can do exactly that. The device, which has no moving parts, works by a process called radiative cooling. It blocks incoming sunlight to keep from heating it up, and at the same time efficiently radiates infrared light — which is essentially heat — that passes straight out into the sky and into space, cooling the device significantly below the ambient air temperature. The key to the functioning of this simple, inexpensive system is a special kind of insulation, made of a polyethylene foam called an aerogel."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/system-provides-cooling-no-electricity-1030">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The new material could bring consumers affordable access to consumer-grade infrared detectors in products such as autonomous cars and in-home thermal imaging for security or fire protection. Five years ago, when University of Arizona materials scientist Jeffrey Pyun presented his first generation of orange-tinted plastic lens to optical scientist Robert Norwood, he responded, “This isn’t the ‘60s. No one wants orange glasses, man.” In the years since, a team led by Puyn has refined the material and created the next generation of lenses. The plastic, a sulfur-based polymer forged from waste generated by refining fossil fuels, is incredibly useful for lenses, window and other devices requiring transmission of infrared light, or IR, which makes heat visible. “IR imaging technology is already used extensively for military applications such as night vision and heat-seeking missiles," said Pyun, a professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry who leads the lab that developed the polymer. "But for consumers and the transportation sector, cost limits high-volume production of this technology.” The new lens material could make IR cameras and sensor devices more accessible to consumers, according to Norwood, a professor in the James C. Wyant College of Optical Sciences."</em> <a href="https://uanews.arizona.edu/story/using-computational-chemistry-produce-cheaper-infrared-plastic-lenses">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A technology that has enabled ever-faster delivery of voice and data over the Internet and other telecommunications platforms could play a front-and-center role in NASA’s quest to develop a super-small instrument for gathering unprecedented details about extraterrestrial planets, moons, comets, and asteroids. Although its critical component is the size of a computer chip, the instrument promises to exceed the performance of a similar-type, but significantly larger instrument installed at a ground-based observatory in Hawaii. Since its installation at the summit of Mt. Haleakala in 2014, the Japanese-developed Mid-Infrared Heterodyne Instrument, or MILAHI, has gathered extraordinarily detailed, continuous measurements of the atmospheric dynamics, thermal structure, and surface compositions of Mars and Venus. As good as MILAHI is, it’s too big and heavy to fly on a traditional satellite, let alone a less-expensive CubeSat whose small size and lower cost would allow scientists to fly multiple, similarly equipped platforms for multipoint observations, said Principal Investigator Tony Yu, a technologist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, who recently won technology-development funds from NASA’s Planetary Concepts for the Advancement of Solar System Observations (PICASSO) program to mature a smaller MILAHI-type instrument. “We want to do similar science, but we need to reduce the instrument’s size,” Yu said, adding that his team’s goal is to create a small, lightweight device that consumes significantly less power and operates without moving parts, making it ideal for flying on CubeSat platforms."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/nasa-taps-telecommunications-technology-to-develop-more-capable-miniaturized-spectrometer">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Electric vehicle owners may soon be able to pull into a fueling station, plug their car in, go to the restroom, get a cup of coffee and in 10 minutes, drive out with a fully charged battery, according to a team of engineers. "We demonstrated that we can charge an electrical vehicle in ten minutes for a 200 to 300 mile range," said Chao-Yang Wang, William E. Diefenderfer Chair of mechanical engineering, professor of chemical engineering and professor of materials science and engineering, and director of the Electrochemical Engine Center at Penn State. "And we can do this maintaining 2,500 charging cycles, or the equivalent of half a million miles of travel." Lithium-ion batteries degrade when rapidly charged at ambient temperatures under 50 degrees Fahrenheit because, rather than the lithium ions smoothly being inserted into the carbon anodes, the lithium deposits in spikes on the anode surface. This lithium plating reduces cell capacity, but also can cause electrical spikes and unsafe battery conditions. Batteries heated above the lithium plating threshold, whether by external or internal heating, will not exhibit lithium plating."</em> <a href="https://news.psu.edu/story/594641/2019/10/30/research/and-out-10-minute-electrical-vehicle-recharge">[...]</a>

They are intended as successors to the earlier ATtiny chips, such as the ATtiny85 and ATtiny84. I reviewed the range in an earlier article: Getting Started with the New ATtiny Chips. A new Arduino core has been developed for the new ATtiny chips by Spence Konde and his collaborators, called megaTinyCore [1]."</em> <a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2OJT">[...]</a>
