<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1635, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hooke">Robert Hooke</a>. Este Físico inglês descobriu a lei da elasticidade, conhecida como lei de Hooke, e inventou a mola de equilíbrio para relógios. Ele era um cientista virtuoso cujo âmbito de pesquisa variava amplamente, incluindo física, astronomia, química, biologia, geologia, arquitectura e tecnologia naval. Ele também inventou ou aperfeiçoou instrumentos meteorológicos, como o barómetro, o anemómetro e o higrómetro.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1768, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Robert_Argand">Jean-Robert Argand</a>. Este matemático suíço foi um dos primeiros a usar números complexos, que ele aplicou para mostrar que todas as equações algébricas têm raízes. O seu nome está associado ao diagrama de Argand, uma representação geométrica de números complexos como pontos num plano cartesiano, com a porção real do número no eixo do x a parte imaginária no eixo y.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, 1853, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrik_Lorentz">Hendrik Lorentz</a>. Este Físico holandês partilhou (com Pieter Zeeman) o Prémio Nobel de Física em 1902 pela sua teoria da influência do magnetismo sobre os fenómenos da radiação electromagnética. A teoria foi confirmada pelas descobertas de Zeeman e deu origem à teoria da relatividade especial de Albert Einstein. Desde o início, Lorentz fez questão de estender a teoria da electricidade e da luz de James Clerk Maxwell. O seu trabalho fundamental nos campos da óptica e da electricidade revolucionou as concepções da natureza da matéria.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1906, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Darlington">Sidney Darlington</a>. Este engenheiro electrotécnico norte americano é inventor de uma configuração de transístor em 1953, o par Darlington. Ele avançou o estado da teoria de redes, desenvolvendo a abordagem de síntese de perda de inserção e inventou o radar chirp, as miras de bombardeio e a orientação de armas e foguetes.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1937, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roald_Hoffmann">Roald Hoffmann</a>. Este químico americano nascido na Polónia, recebeu, com Fukui Kenichi do Japão, o Prémio Nobel de Química em 1981 pelas suas investigações independentes dos mecanismos de reacções químicas. O seu trabalho visa antecipar teoricamente o curso das reacções químicas. Baseia-se na mecânica quântica (a teoria cujo ponto de partida é que os menores blocos de construção da matéria podem ser considerados tanto partículas quanto ondas), o que tenta explicar como os átomos se comportam. A interacção orbital e as relações de simetria entre moléculas ou partes de moléculas são fundamentais para essa teoria de conservação da simetria orbital em reacções químicas.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou a Intel anunciou um sistema neuromórfico de 8 milhões de neurónios, composto por 64 chips de pesquisa Loihi - nome de código Pohoiki Beach - está agora disponível para a comunidade de investigação. Com a Pohoiki Beach, os investigadores podem experimentar o chip de pesquisa inspirado no cérebro da Intel, Loihi, que aplica os princípios encontrados nos cérebros biológicos às arquitecturas de computadores. A Loihi permite que os utilizadores processem informações até 1.000 vezes mais rápido e 10.000 vezes mais eficiente do que CPUs para aplicações especializadas, como codificação esparsa, pesquisa de gráficos e problemas de satisfação de restrições.</p>

<p>Também esta semana ficámos a saber que o sistema de posicionamento global Galileo ficou inoperacional durante vários dias tendo entretanto voltado a ficar operacional. Os utilizadores comerciais já podem ver sinais de recuperação dos serviços de navegação e de hora do Galileo, embora algumas flutuações possam ainda ocorrer. O incidente técnico foi originado por um mau funcionamento do equipamento na infraestrutura terrestre do Galileo, afectando o cálculo das previsões de tempo e órbita, e que são usados para calcular a mensagem de navegação. O mau funcionamento afectou diferentes elementos nas instalações terrestres.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. É apresentada também a revista Hackspace Magazine de Agosto e o livro "Elements of Programming".</p>

<p><em>"Today, Intel announced that an 8 million-neuron neuromorphic system comprising 64 Loihi research chips — codenamed Pohoiki Beach — is now available to the broader research community. With Pohoiki Beach, researchers can experiment with Intel’s brain-inspired research chip, Loihi, which applies the principles found in biological brains to computer architectures. Loihi enables users to process information up to 1,000 times faster and 10,000 times more efficiently than CPUs for specialized applications like sparse coding, graph search and constraint-satisfaction problems. “We are impressed with the early results demonstrated as we scale Loihi to create more powerful neuromorphic systems. Pohoiki Beach will now be available to more than 60 ecosystem partners, who will use this specialized system to solve complex, compute-intensive problems.” –Rich Uhlig, managing director of Intel Labs Why It’s Important: With the introduction of Pohoiki Beach, researchers can now efficiently scale up novel neural-inspired algorithms — such as sparse coding, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and path planning — that can learn and adapt based on data inputs. Pohoiki Beach represents a major milestone in Intel’s neuromorphic research, laying the foundation for Intel Labs to scale the architecture to 100 million neurons later this year."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news/intels-pohoiki-beach-64-chip-neuromorphic-system-delivers-breakthrough-results-research-tests/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scientists from the Skoltech Center for Energy Science and Technology, the Institute for Problems of Chemical Physics of RAS, and the Department of Chemistry of MSU recently presented solar cells based on conjugated polymers and fullerene derivatives that demonstrated record-high radiation stability. Their ability to withstand gamma radiation of >6,000 Gy raises hopes for their stable operation in near-earth orbit for a period of 10 years or even longer. The results of the study were published in ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces. When the Soviet Union launched the first-ever satellite some 60 years ago, its radio signal transmitted at three frequencies that could be captured anywhere on Earth. However, three weeks later the transmitter went silent, having consumed all the power provided by the onboard batteries, which accounted for the larger part of the satellite’s weight. A lesson was learned from the first launch and all satellites that followed carried solar cells that convert the light energy into electricity to power the onboard electronic systems."</em> <a href="https://www.skoltech.ru/en/2019/07/organic-solar-cells-will-last-10-years-in-space/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2019/july/quantum-sensor-artificial-atoms-.html">Quantum sensor breakthrough using naturally occurring vibrations in artificial atoms</a></h2>

<p><em>"A team of scientists, led by the University of Bristol, have discovered a new method that could be used to build quantum sensors with ultra-high precision. When individual atoms emit light, they do so in discrete packets called photons. When this light is measured, this discrete or ‘granular’ nature leads to especially low fluctuations in its brightness, as two or more photons are never emitted at the same time. This property is particularly useful in developing future quantum technologies, where low fluctuations are key, and has led to a surge of interest in engineered systems that act like atoms when they emit light, but whose properties are more easily tailored. These ‘artificial atoms’ as they are known, are typically made from solid materials, and are in fact much larger objects, in which the presence of vibrations is unavoidable, and usually considered to be detrimental. However, a collaborative team, led by the University of Bristol, has now established that these naturally occurring vibrations in artificial atoms can surprisingly lead to an even greater suppression of fluctuations in brightness than that present in natural atomic systems."</em> <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2019/july/quantum-sensor-artificial-atoms-.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Internet searches, decade-old emails and on-demand video offerings help contribute to electricity consumption by America’s server farms and data centers amounting to more than 2 percent of the country’s annual total. Those data centers – which operate millions of drives and hold massive amounts of digital data – use some 70 billion kilowatt hours per year of energy. One kWh is enough power to keep a smartphone charged for about a year. At an average cost of 10 cents per kWh, the annual cost of all that power is around $7 billion. Now a method that can potentially reduce energy consumption in magnetic memory devices and improve their speeds is advancing at Purdue University. The method involves a combination of spintronic and photonic materials, where ultrashort laser pulses are employed to generate intense magnetic fields to manipulate the spin orientation of magnetic materials."</em> <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2019/Q3/light-may-increase-magnetic-memory-speeds-1,000-times,-decrease-electricity-consumption.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://research.a-star.edu.sg/articles/highlights/making-light-behave-in-useful-ways/">Making light behave in useful ways</a></h2>

<p><em>"By integrating nanoantennas with liquid crystals, A*STAR researchers have created a metasurface that allows fine dynamic control over the properties of light. From holograms to augmented reality devices and optical sensors, a common enabling principle behind these innovations is the ability to precisely manipulate light.

In short, the system does automatically what is virtually impossible for humans to do by hand. In a paper published today in Science Advances, the researchers demonstrate the system by fabricating actuators — devices that mechanically control robotic systems in response to electrical signals — that show different black-and-white images at different angles. One actuator, for instance, portrays a Vincent van Gogh portrait when laid flat. Tilted an angle when it’s activated, however, it portrays the famous Edvard Munch painting “The Scream.” The researchers also 3-D printed floating water lilies with petals equipped with arrays of actuators and hinges that fold up in response to magnetic fields run through conductive fluids."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/automated-design-print-actuators-robotics-0712">[...]</a>

While a small proportion of the hundreds of types of plastics can be recycled by conventional technology, researchers found that there are other things that can be done to reuse plastics after they’ve served their original purpose. The research, published in The Journal for Carbon Research, focuses on chemical recycling which uses the constituent elements of the plastic to make new materials. While all plastics are made of carbon, hydrogen and sometimes oxygen, the amounts and arrangements of these three elements make each plastic unique. As plastics are very pure and highly refined chemicals, they can be broken down into these elements and then bonded in different arrangements to make high value materials such as carbon nanotubes.

The new method uses pulses of light from a xenon lamp, and can erase black, blue, red and green toners without damaging the paper, according to a study in the Journal of Cleaner Production. “Our method makes it possible to unprint and then reprint on the same paper at least five times, which is typically as many times paper can be reused with conventional recycling. By eliminating the steps involved in conventional recycling, our unprinting method could reduce energy costs, pollution and greenhouse gas emissions,” said study coauthor Rajiv Malhotra, an assistant professor in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering in the School of Engineering at Rutgers University–New Brunswick. Conventional recycling of coated paper is a major contributor to climate change emissions, chemical pollution and energy use, according to the study."</em> <a href="https://news.rutgers.edu/new-unprinting-method-can-help-recycle-paper-and-curb-environmental-costs/20190626">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Elements of Programming provides a different understanding of programming than is presented elsewhere. Its major premise is that practical programming, like other areas of science and engineering, must be based on a solid mathematical foundation. The book shows that algorithms implemented in a real programming language, such as C++, can operate in the most general mathematical setting. For example, the fast exponentiation algorithm is defined to work with any associative operation. Using abstract algorithms leads to efficient, reliable, secure, and economical software.

Over the last several months, I've been working on such a project. The main project is a Head Up Display (HUD) for my car that will show basic vehicle information (such as speed) alongside in depth data relevant to diagnostics and off road driving. I was dragged into a bit of a rabbit hole when I got hooked on the idea of including a graphic of the vehicle's drivetrain that displays, in real time, exactly which wheels are slipping when traction is poor (this is an AWD vehicle). This rabbit hole lead me to design a control board I'm calling Telemetry Master.

It's 5-inch high-brightness LCD panel and LED strip makes viewing vital car/engine information quick and easy. The firmware currently only has the option of displaying three different screens. One demo screen, and two screen showing some live information from the Megasquirt. The screens are flipped by touching the LCD screen (it's a capacitive touch panel).

<p><em>"This device automatically detects and uploads the location of road hazards, creating a safer driving environment! Introduction Driving on smooth roads is something everyone enjoys and certainly provides for a much safer environment. Rough and jagged roads can be hazardous to those who drive on them, leading to the possibility of more accidents, and most significantly, more deaths. The condition of roadways can vary greatly within both urban and rural cities, and therefore, devices that can aid in quickly identifying hazardous roadways can be extremely valuable to infrastructure engineers striving to increase the safety and quality of their cities. While this prototype device is not fully integrated with urban planners and construction companies, it represents a possible solution to solving one of the primary problems of cities across the world.

<p><em>"A rather convenient device to monitor heart rate while running. This is a second iteration of my heart monitoring project, previous one was showing heart beats on a chest, and was connected to uECG via wire. That looks cool, but isn't practical at all - you can't see well how many LEDs exactly are currently on, it's out of your normal view field, and wire connecting it to uECG device creates a lot of problems for the sensor itself, so it basically doesn't work when you run. This version solves all these problems: it is wrist-worn, so you can see it while keeping eyes on the road, and it's wireless, so no distortion of readings, it really works for running and allows you to keep track on heart load.

<h2><a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2JMU">Simple DataFlash Board</a></h2>

<p><em>"This is a small board that plugs into one of the headers on an Arduino Uno or other board to provide 4Mbytes of non-volatile storage It works with either 5V or 3.3V boards, and is based on the low-cost 4Mbyte Winbond W25Q32FVSIG DataFlash chip. It is ideal for applications such as data logging, playing audio samples, and storing text. I also describe a simple DataFlash library to interface to the board. Introduction A DataFlash chip is a simple and low cost way to add non-volatile storage to a microcontroller; chips offering 4Mbytes of storage are available for under 20 pence/cents each from AliExpress or eBay. The downside of using DataFlash chips for non-volatile storage is that the smallest area you can erase is a 4Kbyte sector. If you want to provide the ability to change a single byte at an arbitrary address you have to copy the previous contents of the sector to RAM, or elsewhere on the DataFlash, erase the 4Kbyte sector containing the byte, update the sector copy, and then restore the sector to the DataFlash."</em> <a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2JMU">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Ever wake up in the morning found your CPAP mask is off? This device will alarm you if you have unintentionally removed mask during sleep. CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) therapy is the most common form of treatment for Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). For the CPAP therapy patients, it is important to wear the CPAP mask all the time while sleep in order for the therapy to effective, and also to meet the CPAP compliance criteria required by the insurance companies. However many people have issues while adjusting to sleeping with a CPAP mask, including the problem of waking up consistently to find their CPAP mask off. Although many modern CPAP devices are sophisticated enough to differentiate the mask actually being on the person or if the person just turns it on but doesn’t wear the mask, not all of them have alarm or alarm loud enough to wake up the patient when the CPAP mask is removed, or there is a large air leak."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Digital-ManometerCPAP-Machine-Monitor/">[...]</a>
