<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1804, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Eduard_Weber">Wilhelm Eduard Weber</a>.  Este Físico alemão investigou o magnetismo terrestre. Durante seis anos, Weber trabalhou em estreita colaboração com Carl Gauss. Weber desenvolveu magnetómetros sensíveis, um telégrafo electromagnético (1833) e outros instrumentos magnéticos durante esse período. O seu trabalho posterior sobre a razão entre as unidades de carga electrodinâmicas e electrostáticas mostrou-se extremamente importante e foi crucial para James Clerk Maxwell na sua teoria electromagnética da luz. (Weber descobriu que a proporção era de 3,1074 x 108 m / s, mas não notou o facto de estar próxima da velocidade da luz.) Os últimos anos de Weber foram dedicados ao trabalho em electrodinâmica e na estrutura eléctrica da matéria. A unidade magnética, Weber, recebeu o nome dele.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1854, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrik_Willem_Bakhuis_Roozeboom">Hendrik Willem Bakhuis-Roozeboom</a>. Este Físico holandês  divulgou a regra da fase de Gibbs por toda a Europa. Tendo originalmente ouvido falar de Van der Waals, Bakhuis-Roozeboom converteu a teoria de Gibbs em prática. Enquanto Gibbs raramente experimentara, Bakhuis-Roozeboom fazia todos os tipos de medições que serviam para provar a validade da regra de fase e, além disso, elaborou os detalhes da sua aplicação a muitos casos individuais. A química moderna das ligas beneficia muito com a amplificação do entendimento da regra das fases.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1873, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._T._Whittaker">Edmund Taylor Whittaker</a>. Este Matemático inglês fez contribuições pioneiras para a área de funções especiais, que é de particular interesse na física matemática. Whittaker mais conhecido pelo seu trabalho em análise, em particular análise numérica, mas ele também trabalhou na mecânica celeste e na história da matemática aplicada e da física. Ele escreveu artigos sobre funções algébricas e funções automórficas. Os seus resultados em equações diferenciais parciais incluíram uma solução geral da equação de Laplace em três dimensões numa forma específica e a solução da equação de onda. No lado aplicado da matemática, ele estava interessado na teoria da relatividade e também trabalhou em teoria electromagnética.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1906, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Gelfond">Aleksandr Osipovich Gelfond</a>. Este Matemático russo criou técnicas básicas no estudo de números transcendentais (números que não podem ser expressos como raiz ou solução de uma equação algébrica com coeficientes racionais). Ele avançou profundamente na teoria dos números transcendentais e na teoria da interpolação e aproximação de funções variáveis complexas. Ele estabeleceu o carácter transcendental de qualquer número da forma ab, onde a é um número algébrico diferente de 0 ou 1 e b é qualquer número algébrico irracional, que agora é conhecido como teorema de Gelfond. Esta declaração resolveu sete dos 23 problemas famosos que tinham sido colocados pelo matemático alemão David Hilbert em 1900.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1911 - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_Wyeth_(inventor)">Nathaniel Wyeth</a>. Este Químico e inventor norte-americano criou a garrafa de plástico PET. A sua patente foi atribuída a Du Pont e descreveu essas garrafas como "úteis para engarrafar líquidos sob pressão, como bebidas gaseificadas" que tinham "excelentes propriedades de resistência, são resistentes ao impacto, e são capazes de reter líquidos sob pressões de até 100 psig ”(US No. 3.733.309, publicado em 15 de maio de 1973). Foi o primeiro plástico adequado para armazenar bebidas gaseificadas que era seguro o suficiente para atender aos requisitos de segurança alimentar. As suas outras contribuições incluem o desenvolvimento de equipamentos de processamento de polímeros, fibras têxteis sintéticas e outros produtos plásticos.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1932, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Gilles_de_Gennes">Pierre-Gilles de Gennes</a>. Este físico francês recebeu o Prémio Nobel de Física de 1991 por "descobrir que métodos desenvolvidos para estudar fenómenos de ordem em sistemas simples podem ser generalizados para formas mais complexas de matéria, em particular cristais e polímeros líquidos". Ele descreveu matematicamente como, por exemplo, dipolos magnéticos, moléculas longas ou cadeias de moléculas podem, sob certas condições, formar estados ordenados e o que acontece quando eles passam de um estado ordenado para um estado desordenado. Tais mudanças de ordem ocorrem quando, por exemplo, um íman aquecido muda de um estado no qual todos os pequenos ímans atómicos são alinhados em paralelo a um estado desordenado no qual os ímans são orientados aleatoriamente.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou a NASA anunciou que ainda não conseguiu avistar a sonda Indiana que se terá despenhado na superfície da Lua. O Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter da NASA passou pelo local de pouso da nave Vikram pela segunda vez e novamente foi incapaz de detectar o veículo. Este fazia parte da missão Chandrayaan 2 da Índia e, em 6 de Setembro, deveria aterrar suavemente na superfície da lua e iniciar duas semanas de investigações científicas, incluindo a instalação de um veículo espacial. Mas no final desse processo, a nave ficou em silêncio. A agência espacial da Índia disse que avistou a sonda logo após o suposto acidente, mas não forneceu mais detalhes.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como um modelo 3D que poderá ser útil. São apresentadas as revistas Hackspace Magazine nº 24 de Novembro e a newelectronics de 10 de Outubro de 2019.</p>

<p><em>"NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has passed over the targeted landing site of India's Vikram spacecraft a second time and again has been unable to spot the vehicle. The Vikram lander was part of India's Chandrayaan 2 mission, and on Sept. 6, it was meant to touch down softly on the moon's surface and begin two weeks of science investigations, including deploying a rover. But late in that process, the spacecraft fell silent. India's space agency said that it had spotted the lander soon after the presumed crash, but hasn't provided more details. "I suspect, based on what they've said, that it could be just that we're not looking at the right place or we just can't see it because of the illumination," Noah Petro, NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter project scientist, told Space.com. "Until we know more details about where it is, it's going to be very hard for us to find it.""</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/india-moon-lander-not-found-by-nasa.html">[...]</a>

<h2>[Microchip’s Low-Power Radiation-Tolerant (RT) PolarFire FPGA Enables High-Bandwidth Space Systems with Lower Total System Cost](https://www.microchip.com/pressreleasepage/microchip-low-power-radiation-tolerant-(rt)</h2>

<p><em>"Industry’s lowest-power FPGA enables high-throughput on-orbit processing systems that withstand radiation effects in space Developers of spacecraft electronics use radiation-tolerant (RT) field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to create on-board systems that meet the demanding performance needs of future space missions, survive the brutal launch process and continue to operate reliably in the harsh environment of space. Extending its RT FPGA offering to bring these capabilities to emerging high-performance space applications, Microchip Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP) today introduced the RT PolarFire® FPGA that is optimized to meet the most demanding requirements in spacecraft payload systems’ high-speed data paths with the lowest possible power consumption and heat generation. “We are supporting an evolving set of on-orbit space applications that need high levels of operating performance and density, low power consumption and minimal heat dissipation, while reducing system-level costs,” said Bruce Weyer, vice president of Microchip’s FPGA business unit. “Our RT PolarFire FPGA enables the major leap in computing throughput required for these applications including processing-intensive neural networks for object detection and recognition, high-resolution passive and active imaging, and high-precision remote scientific measurement, while maintaining a path to QML qualification.” A growing number of space applications need greater computational performance so they can transmit processed information rather than raw data and make optimal use of limited downlink bandwidth. The RT PolarFire FPGA enables this at significantly lower cost and with faster design cycles than possible with application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). It also significantly reduces power as compared to the alternative of using FPGAs based on static random access memory (SRAM) while eliminating their vulnerability to radiation-induced configuration upsets."</em> [[...]](https://www.microchip.com/pressreleasepage/microchip-low-power-radiation-tolerant-(rt)

<p><em>"Recent Findings Should be Celebrated, but Practical Realities are the Real Test Quantum computing receives a lot of attention due to its potential to take on problems beyond the reach of today’s computers, such as new drug discovery, financial modeling and exploring how the universe works. Universities, governments and technology companies around the world are striving to achieve a commercially-viable quantum computing system. While the collective progress is real – and is getting noticed – the field is still at mile one of what will be a marathon toward quantum computing’s commercialization. That said, important milestones along this journey should be recognized, celebrated and built upon. More Promising Results As researchers at Intel and across the globe are discovering, quantum computing has the potential to tackle problems that conventional computing – even the world’s most powerful supercomputers – can’t quite handle. Today, it was confirmed that researchers from Google had demonstrated the extraordinary speed of quantum, as compared to traditional supercomputers, with a benchmark test known as “quantum supremacy.” The Google team designed an algorithm that could run an analysis in 200 seconds on a small quantum processor, a 53-qubit superconducting test chip, that would take the most powerful supercomputer approximately 10,000 years to perform."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/race-commercially-viable-quantum-computing-marathon-not-sprint/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.microchip.com/en/pressreleasepage/microchip-solves-interoperability-challenges-of-90W-PoE-wiring">Microchip Solves Interoperability Challenges of Delivering up to 90 Watts of Power Over Ethernet Wiring</a></h2>

<p><em>"Company’s Power over Ethernet (PoE) offering enables both pre-standard and IEEE 802.3bt-2018-compliant devices to be powered within existing Ethernet infrastructure As the industry adopts the latest generation of PoE technology for managing data and power over a single Ethernet cable, users face the challenge of making pre-standard powered devices (PDs) work alongside new IEEE® 802.3bt-2018-compliant PDs in an existing Ethernet infrastructure. Microchip Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP) has eased the transition with IEEE 802.3bt-2018-compliant PoE injectors and midspans for users and power sourcing equipment (PSE) chipsets for system developers that enable both pre-standard and IEEE-compliant PDs to receive up to 90W of power without changing switches or cabling. “As both a system and chipset supplier that has contributed to IEEE 802.3bt-2018 and all major standards leading up to it, we are ideally positioned to provide an easy migration path for meeting 30W to 90W device powering needs with plug-and-play convenience,” said Iris Shuker, PoE business unit manager with Microchip. “Combining extensive PD interoperability with firmware upgradability and more than 15 years of proven technology, our PSE chipsets offer a unique architecture that eliminates the need to redesign system boards or offer separate pre-standard and IEEE-compliant product lines. They are also at the heart of our IEEE 802.3bt-2018-compliant PoE injectors and midspans that bridge the interoperability gap for users.” Many proprietary solutions were brought to market through 2018 that support specifications such as Universal PoE (UPOE) and power over HDBaseT (PoH). They meet the higher powering needs of two-pair and four-pair PDs including kiosks, POS terminals, thin clients, 802.11ac/ax access points, small cells, smart buildings, industrial automation systems and connected LED lighting."</em> <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en/pressreleasepage/microchip-solves-interoperability-challenges-of-90W-PoE-wiring">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7525">New Selfie Shows Curiosity, the Mars Chemist</a></h2>

<p><em>"A new selfie taken by NASA's Curiosity Mars rover is breathtaking, but it's especially meaningful for the mission's team: Stitched together from 57 individual images taken by a camera on the end of Curiosity's robotic arm, the panorama also commemorates only the second time the rover has performed a special chemistry experiment. The selfie was taken on Oct. 11, 2019 (Sol 2,553) in a location named "Glen Etive" (pronounced "glen EH-tiv"), which is part of the "clay-bearing unit," a region the team has eagerly awaited reaching since before Curiosity launched.

An international team of scientists from Australia, Japan and the United States has produced the prototype, based on a design 10 years in the making. Quantum computers promise fast solutions to hard problems, but they need a large number of quantum components and must be relatively error free. Current quantum processors are small and prone to errors. The new design provides an alternative solution, using light, to reach the scale needed to eventually outperform classical computers. The new research, published in Science, produced a quantum processor made of laser light that has built-in scalability, allowing the number of quantum components to scale to extreme numbers."</em> <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/news/all-news/2019/oct/quantum-processors-laser-light">[...]</a>

This demonstration made use of state-of-the-art large-scale and low-loss optical switches based on MEMS technology, three types of next-generation spatial-division multiplexing fibers, and included the routing of signals with capacities from 10 Terabit per second to 1 Petabit per second. This corresponds to more than 100 times the capacity of currently available networks. This is a major step forward towards the early implementation of the petabit-class backbone optical networks capable of supporting the increasing requirements of internet services such as broadband video streaming, 5G mobile networks or Internet of Things.

In the paper, it is argued that their device reached “quantum supremacy” and that “a state-of-the-art supercomputer would require approximately 10,000 years to perform the equivalent task.” We argue that an ideal simulation of the same task can be performed on a classical system in 2.5 days and with far greater fidelity. This is in fact a conservative, worst-case estimate, and we expect that with additional refinements the classical cost of the simulation can be further reduced.

<p><em>"MIT-developed method may lead to portable devices for making the disinfectant on-site where it’s needed. Hydrogen peroxide, a useful all-purpose disinfectant, is found in most medicine cabinets in the developed world. But in remote villages in developing countries, where it could play an important role in health and sanitation, it can be hard to come by. Now, a process developed at MIT could lead to a simple, inexpensive, portable device that could produce hydrogen peroxide continuously from just air, water, and electricity, providing a way to sterilize wounds, food-preparation surfaces, and even water supplies. The new method is described this week in the journal Joule in a paper by MIT students Alexander Murray, Sahag Voskian, and Marcel Schreier and MIT professors T. Alan Hatton and Yogesh Surendranath. Even at low concentrations, hydrogen peroxide is an effective antibacterial agent, and after carrying out its sterilizing function it breaks down into plain water, in contrast to other agents such as chlorine that can leave unwanted byproducts from its production and use."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/mit-process-could-make-hydrogen-peroxide-available-remote-places-1023">[...]</a>

You can even make a crude voltage regulator using a Zener diode, 78xx series regulators and some other complimentary components, but that won't be able to supply high currents like 2-3A. The overall efficiency of linear regulators is very less compared to switch mode supplies, buck, boost converters since it dissipates the unused energy as heat and has to be removed constantly other wise the regulator seizes. This power supply design is totally worth it if you don't have any power efficiency issues or if you are not powering a portable circuit from a battery. The whole circuit is made of three blocks, 1.

<p><em>"The electrons movement in electronic components lead to the generation of heat which when beyond certain thresholds, prevents some components from functioning properly and in others could lead to a catastrophic breakdown. For this reason, the topics of ventilation, overheating, and cooling are important discussions in the design of any device. Several cooling solutions, including popular ones like; the use of aluminum heat sinks, and fans/heat extractor can be adopted for a project but the ultimate choice usually depends on the amount of heat produced and the maximum level the components can withstand. Heat extractors/fans are used in devices like Laptop computers and similar in which the amount of heat being generated could get really high. To save power and reduce noise levels, the fans are deployed in a feedback-based system such that the they only come on when certain heat threshold is attained and goes back off when heat levels are back to normal. For today’s tutorial, we will examine how a DIY version of this temperature-controlled fan can be built and deployed in your electronics project."</em> <a href="https://www.electronics-lab.com/project/temperature-controlled-fan-using-attiny10/">[...]</a>

And the first thought comes to our mind about frequency domain analysis is "Bode plot". Bode plot is a combination plot of magnitude and phase difference of output vs. input of a cosine wave of single frequency, when it is applied to a circuit. Each of these cosine wave (signal) are applied once at a time and the frequency (in Hz or rad/sec) is increased in linear order (called chirp). All the while the amplitude of sine wave is kept constant (at say 1V_peak). While the frequency can be increased in small steps (1Hz/ sec), the time required to complete the entire frequency range can be quite big."</em> <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/hobbydebraj/bode-analyzer-using-stm32f407">[...]</a>

The project is a simple 15-minute timer that flashes an LED once every 2 seconds while it is counting down, and then beeps a piezo buzzer when the time has expired. You could use it as the basis for an egg timer, a bath-overflow alarm, or any other fixed timer application. Introduction I thought it would be interesting to compare the low-power performance of the new 0-series ATtiny microcontrollers with my old favourite, the ATtiny85. One of my first projects based on the ATtiny85 was a simple 15-minute timer that took advantage of the low-power sleep mode to avoid the need for an on/off switch, and this has turned out to be one of my most popular articles: ATtiny Low Power. I thought it would be interesting to try and reproduce the project with one of the new 0-series ATtiny chips from Microchip, to compare the power consumption in the low-power sleep mode between the two devices."</em> <a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2RA3">[...]</a>

I wanted to simultaneously trigger the appropriate camera to record on a doorbell press (even if I was home) notify me on my phone (in case I wasnt home) and blink all of the smart lights in my house (if I was listening to music, etc.). Originally, I used Stringify to achieve this integration beautifully (it is now defunct) but have since moved to IFTTT which has allowed me to do most of the same things. I constrained myself to make no permanent changes to my existing doorbell setup: I both wanted to leave everything intact so as to annoy my wife minimally but still allow for the integration I wanted. Homemade optocouplers proved to work splendidly for reading the doorbell states and I was ultimately able to give the entire project a polished and professional look while making it suitable for a wealth of other microcontrollers."</em> <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/167693-doorbell-notifier">[...]</a>
