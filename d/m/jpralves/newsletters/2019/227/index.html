<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1667, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Girolamo_Saccheri">Girolamo Saccheri</a>. Este Matemático italiano trabalhou para provar o quinto postulado de Euclides, que pode ser declarado como: "Através de qualquer ponto que não esteja numa determinada linha, uma e apenas uma linha podem ser traçadas paralelas à linha". Euclides viu que a prova não era evidente, mas também não a forneceu; em vez disso, ele a aceitou como uma suposição. Posteriormente, muitos matemáticos tentaram provar este quinto postulado a partir dos restantes axiomas - e falharam. Saccheri adoptou a nova abordagem de assumir primeiro que o postulado estava errado, depois seguiu todas as consequências, procurando qualquer contradição que deixasse o único postulado original como a única solução possível. No processo, ele chegou perto de descobrir a geometria não euclidiana, mas desistiu cedo demais.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1850, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugen_Goldstein">Eugen Goldstein</a>. Este físico alemão descobriu e nomeou os raios do canal (1886) que emergem através de orifícios nos ânodos dos tubos de descarga eléctrica de baixa pressão (posteriormente mostrados como partículas carregadas positivamente). Anteriormente, ele designou o termo "raio catódico" (1876) emitido a partir de um cátodo. Ele foi o primeiro a ver que eles podiam projectar uma sombra e foram emitidos perpendicularmente à superfície. Ele também investigou os comprimentos de onda da luz emitida por metais e óxidos quando os raios do canal colidem sobre eles.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1932, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_H._Dennard">Robert H. Dennard</a>. Este Engenheiro electrotécnico norte-americano é responsável pela invenção da memória dinâmica de acesso aleatório (DRAM), para a qual foi emitida uma patente em 1968. Dennard também foi um dos primeiros a reconhecer o tremendo potencial de reduzir os MOSFETs. A teoria de escala que ele e seus colegas formularam em 1974 postulou que os MOSFETs continuam a funcionar como interruptores controlados por tensão, enquanto todas as figuras de mérito, como densidade de layout, velocidade operacional e eficiência energética, melhoram - desde que as dimensões geométricas, as tensões e concentrações de doping sejam consistentemente dimensionadas para manter o mesmo campo eléctrico. Esta propriedade está subjacente ao cumprimento da Lei de Moore e à evolução da micro-electrónica nas últimas décadas.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou a nave espacial Indiana Chandrayaan-2 libertou a sonda Vikram que irá aterrar na Lua. As duas metades da missão lunar da Índia se separaram em preparação para o momento mais importante de todo o esforço.
A 2 de Setembro, a missão Chandrayaan-2 dividiu-se em duas naves espaciais distintas: uma que irá circular pelos pólos da Lua por cerca de um ano e um módulo de aterragem  que, no final desta semana, tentará o primeiro toque da Índia na Lua.</p>

<p>Também esta semana ficámos a saber que foi lançada a especificação USB 4. Esta vem essencialmente permitir a operação de duas faixas usando cabos USB Type-C existentes e operação de até 40 Gbps em cabos certificados, os vários protocolos de dados e exibição irão partilhar com eficiência a largura de banda agregada máxima, e a compatibilidade com versões anteriores com USB 3.2, USB 2.0 e Thunderbolt 3.</p>

<p>Por fim, é esperado que um asteróide maior que a Torre Eiffel possa passar perto da Terra nas próximas horas. O GT3 2019 é classificado como um "asteróide potencialmente perigoso", o que significa que está a ser examinado detalhadamente pela comunidade astronómica, apenas algumas semanas após a passagem muito próxima de outro sobrevoo - o de um objecto "aniquilador de cidades" com a designação de 2019 OK. A NASA alertou que este asteróide gigantesco que ultrapassa uma bomba nuclear de 50 mega-toneladas de energia passará pela Terra amanhã. A rocha espacial em questão, que tem o nome de 2019 GT3, tem uns impressionantes 370  metros de largura, maior em tamanho do que a icónica Torre Eiffel.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker.</p>

<p><em>"The two halves of India's moon mission have parted ways in preparation for the tensest moment of the entire endeavor. Today (Sept. 2), the Chandrayaan-2 mission split into two separate spacecraft: an orbiter that will circle the moon's poles for about a year and a lander that will, later this week, attempt India's first touchdown on the moon. "All the systems of Chandrayaan-2 Orbiter and Lander are healthy," Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) officials said in a statement. The separation occurred around 3:45 a.m. EDT (745 GMT). So far, both spacecraft are faring well in their separate orbits, ISRO officials added. The Chandrayaan-2 mission launched in July, taking the slow road to the moon, where it arrived in orbit on Aug. 20."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/india-chandrayaan-2-moon-orbiter-lander-separation.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The 2019 GT3 is classified as a “potentially hazardous asteroid”, which means it is being scrutinised in detail by the astronomic community, just weeks after the near miss of another flyby – that of a “city-killer” object with the way too positive codename of 2019 OK. NASA has warned that a mammoth asteroid surpassing a 50 megaton nuke in power will whizz past Earth tomorrow. The space rock in question, which goes by the name 2019 GT3, is a whopping 1,214 feet wide, which is greater in size than the iconic Eiffel Tower. Given the massive size, the object that is moving at a breakneck speed of 30,500 mph is feared to have the potential to produce a gigantic crater in the event of a collision with Earth – about three miles wide. At its closest point to our planet’s surface, the asteroid will be within a distance equalling 0.04996 astronomical units or around 4.6 million miles, which lands it into the category of “potentially hazardous asteroids”, commonly referred to by the abbreviation PHA. NASA has classified the location where the object is heading to as the "near-Earth object" zone, or the “main belt” that is believed to attract asteroids like a magnet, especially given the fact that cosmic rocks are drawn to Earth by gravitational forces. According to a report by spacetelescope.org, there are over 700,000 rocks in space."</em> <a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201909051076732139-asteroid-greater-in-size-than-eiffel-tower-may-race-past-earth-in-hours-to-come/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Hyundai Motor Group has developed the new Vest EXoskeleton (VEX), a wearable robot created to assist industrial workers who spend long hours working in overhead environments. The VEX enhances productivity and reduces fatigue of industrial workers by imitating the movement of human joints to boost load support and mobility. The wearable vest features a polycentric axis – combining multiple pivot points with multi-link muscular assistance – to function, eliminating the need for a battery. At 2.5kg, VEX weighs 22-42% less than competing products and is worn like a backpack. The user places their arms through the shoulder straps of the vest, then fastens the chest and waist buckles. The back section can adjust in length by up to 18 cm to fit a variety of body sizes, while the degree of force assistance can be adjusted over six levels – up to as much as 5.5 kgf."</em> <a href="https://www.hyundai.news/eu/brand/hyundai-develops-wearable-vest-exoskeleton-for-overhead-work/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"At just before 1:50 p.m. EDT on Sept. 1, 2019, NASA’s Parker Solar Probe completed its third close approach of the Sun, called perihelion. At the time of perihelion, the spacecraft was about 15 million miles from the Sun’s surface, traveling at more than 213,200 miles per hour. Mission controllers at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, received a green “A” beacon from the spacecraft soon after perihelion, meaning all systems were performing as designed and that the spacecraft was in good health. This third encounter, which was at approximately the same distance from the Sun and speed as the first two, differs in that the spacecraft’s four instrument suites have been on and gathering data for a longer period than other perihelia. For this third solar encounter, the mission team turned on the instruments when the spacecraft was around 0.45 astronomical units from the Sun on the inbound side of its orbit. (One astronomical unit, or AU, is about 93 million miles, the average distance between the Sun and Earth.)"</em> <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/parkersolarprobe/2019/09/03/parker-solar-probe-completes-third-close-approach-of-the-sun/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"China's Chang'e-4 lunar rover has discovered an unusually colored, 'gel-like' substance during its exploration activities on the far side of the moon. The mission's rover, Yutu-2, stumbled on that surprise during lunar day 8. The discovery prompted scientists on the mission to postpone other driving plans for the rover, and instead focus its instruments on trying to figure out what the strange material is. Day 8 started on July 25; Yutu-2 began navigating a path through an area littered with various small impact craters, with the help and planning of drivers at the Beijing Aerospace Control Center, according to a Yutu-2 'drive diary' published on Aug. 17 by the government-sanctioned Chinese-language publication Our Space, which focuses on space and science communication. On July 28, the Chang'e-4 team was preparing to power Yutu-2 down for its usual midday 'nap' to protect the rover from high temperatures and radiation from the sun high in the sky. A team member checking images from the rover's main camera spotted a small crater that seemed to contain material with a color and luster unlike that of the surrounding lunar surface."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/china-far-side-moon-rover-strange-substance.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Low-cost “piezoelectric” films produce voltage, could be used for flexible electronic components and more. MIT researchers have developed a simple, low-cost method to 3-D print ultrathin films with high-performing “piezoelectric” properties, which could be used for components in flexible electronics or highly sensitive biosensors. Piezoelectric materials produce a voltage in response to physical strain, and they respond to a voltage by physically deforming. They’re commonly used for transducers, which convert energy of one form into another. Robotic actuators, for instance, use piezoelectric materials to move joints and parts in response to an electrical signal. And various sensors use the materials to convert changes in pressure, temperature, force, and other physical stimuli, into a measurable electrical signal."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/3-d-printed-piezoelectric-films-0828">[...]</a>

Soft robots are a class of robotic systems made of compliant materials and capable of safely adapting to complex environments. They have seen rapid growth recently and come in a variety of designs spanning multiple length scales, from meters to submicrometers. In particular, small soft robots at millimeter scale are of practical interest as they can be designed as a combination of miniature actuators simply driven by pneumatic pressure.

The technique uses a novel combination of Wi-Fi signals and accelerometer technology to track devices in near-real time. “We call our approach Wi-Fi-assisted Inertial Odometry (WIO),” says Raghav Venkatnarayan, co-corresponding author of a paper on the work and a Ph.D. student at NC State. “WIO uses Wi-Fi as a velocity sensor to accurately track how far something has moved. Think of it as sonar, but using radio waves, rather than sound waves.” Many devices, such as smartphones, incorporate technology called inertial measurement units (IMUs) to calculate how far a device has moved. However, IMUs suffer from large drift errors, meaning that even minor inaccuracies can quickly become exaggerated."</em> <a href="https://news.ncsu.edu/2019/08/wifi-to-track-indoor-odometry/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The three-dimensional quantum Hall effect was predicted more than 30 years ago, but has not been observed until now by the Singapore University of Technology and Design together with international researchers. The quantum Hall effect (QHE), which was previously known for two-dimensional (2D) systems, was predicted to be possible for three-dimensional (3D) systems by Bertrand Halperin in 1987, but the theory was not proven until recently by researchers from the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) and their research collaborators from around the globe. The Hall effect, a fundamental technique for material characterization, is formed when a magnetic field deflects the flow of electrons sideways and leads to a voltage drop across the transverse direction. In 1980, a surprising observation was made when measuring the Hall effect for a two-dimensional (2D) electron gas trapped in a semiconductor structure - the measured Hall resistivity showed a series of completely flat plateau, quantized to values with a remarkable accuracy of one part in 10 billion. This became known as the QHE. QHE has since revolutionized our fundamental understanding of condensed matter physics, generating a vast field of physics research."</em> <a href="https://www.sutd.edu.sg/Research/Research-News/2019/8/Researchers-demonstrate-three-dimensional-quantum">[...]</a>

Implants made of the latter light metal are advantageous because they can biodegrade in the body, which can absorb magnesium as a mineral nutrient, rendering a second surgery for implant removal unnecessary. To promote rapid healing, the design of implants or their surfaces should be directed towards promotion of cellular adhesion or even in-growth. Materials researchers from the Laboratory of Metal Physics and Technology and the Complex Materials Group at ETH Zurich have therefore collaborated to develop a new procedure for the manufacture of magnesium implants that contain numerous structurally ordered pores but still retain their mechanical stability."</em> <a href="https://ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2019/08/3d-printed-salt-template.html">[...]</a>

In a new study led by researchers from the University of Waterloo, the International School for Advanced Studies and the Complutense University of Madrid a, solid theoretical framework is provided to discuss modifications to predictions of quantum field theory caused by the microstructure of space-time. The Unruh effect, named after the Canadian physicist who theorized it in 1976, is the prediction that someone who has propulsion and hence accelerates would observe photons and other particles in a seemingly empty space while another person who is inertial would see a vacuum in that same area. “What we’ve done is analyzed the conditions to have Unruh effect and found that contrary to an extended belief in a big part of the community thermal response for particle detectors can happen without thermality,” said Eduardo Martin-Martinez, an assistant professor in Waterloo’s Department of Applied Mathematics. “Our findings are important because the Unruh effect is in the boundary between quantum field theory and general relativity, which is what we know, and quantum gravity, which we are yet to understand. “So, if someone wants to develop a theory of what’s going on beyond what we know of quantum field theory and relativity, they need to guarantee they satisfy the conditions we identify in their low energy limits.” The researchers analyzed the mathematical structure of the correlations of a quantum field in frameworks beyond standard quantum field theory."</em> <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/news/news/key-piece-understanding-how-quantum-gravity-affects-low">[...]</a>

Our goal is to enable autonomous robots to animate marionettes with a level of skill that approaches that of human puppeteers. The ETH Zurich project can’t yet animate a complex marionette, but it’s a respectable showing with the dragon, I think."</em> <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-hardware/eth-surich-puppetmaster-robot">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Proving criminal machinations can be difficult – for instance when those involved covertly discharge hazardous wastewater into sewers. A new sensor system developed by Fraunhofer researchers and their partners could soon help safety agencies establish wrongdoing: placed in a sewage canal, it detects relevant substances and helps isolate and expose polluters. There’s always one black sheep, and industry is no exception. While the majority of companies dispose of their wastewater properly, a few want to avoid the associated costs, so they quietly and surreptitiously discharge their hazardous wastewater into the sewage canals. By and large, safety agencies currently have no means of detecting this kind of environmental crime on a broad scale – doing so would far exceed their work-force capacity. But this illegal sewage poses major challenges for wastewater treatment facility operators and can even result in turnover of the affected wastewater treatment ponds."</em> <a href="https://www.fraunhofer.de/en/press/research-news/2019/september/tracking-down-polluters.html">[...]</a>

Everyone knows the sound a (wine) glass makes when you gently tap it, usually it sounds like a fast decaying "ping". Some, more expensive glasses can keep "singing" when you rub a wet finger over the edge. The sound this produces is caused by the glass quickly vibrating in a special way."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/In-Vino-Veritas-a-Wineglass-Oscillator/">[...]</a>

Since recycling is mainly a sorting exercise, and one of deep learning's main applications is the categorization of different images, this was a very natural progression. Keras (in TensorFlow2) is used for the machine learning part, mainly due to its simplicity, as well as some OpenCV for image preprocessing. Base The base consists of a simple pan and tilt system with a box on top. It comunicates with the computer over Bluetooth and is powered by an on-board battery, so the actuator part is completely independent.
