<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1911, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Heatley">Norman Heatley</a>. Este bioquímico inglês resolveu os problemas na extracção da penicilina do seu molde, e abriu o caminho para a sua produção em massa. No Dia D da Segunda Guerra Mundial, os Aliados tinham um stock adequado para tratar os feridos em perigo de infecções bacterianas graves. Embora tenha sido Fleming quem acidentalmente descobriu a penicilina (1928), foi Heatley quem a tornou prática, fazendo quantidades suficientes em 1941 para os seus primeiros testes clínicos. Seu aparato incluía "bacias" de porcelana, batedeiras de leite e bandejas de assar para cultivar as bactérias. Além disso, um método de ensaio que ele desenvolveu poderia medir com precisão a actividade de uma amostra de penicilina, no que ficou conhecido como "unidades de Oxford". O seu método de produção usava pratos de tortas, latas de biscoitos e um recipiente de porcelana apelidado de comadre.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1936, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Woodrow_Wilson">Robert Woodrow Wilson</a>. Este rádio-astrónomo norte-americano partilhou com seu colega de trabalho Arno Penzias o Prémio Nobel de Física de 1978 pela descoberta da radiação cósmica de fundo em micro-ondas usando uma antena de chifre de micro-ondas nos Laboratórios Bell, Holmdel, Nova Jersey. A sua descoberta em 1964 é agora amplamente interpretada como sendo a radiação remanescente do modelo “Big Bang” para a criação do universo há vários biliões de anos atrás. Wilson continuou o seu trabalho de astrofísica com Penzias, procurando por moléculas interestelares e determinando a abundância relativa de isótopos interestelares.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1938, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth">Donald Knuth</a>. Este matemático e cientista da computação ficou conhecido por ter criado o sistema de composição de texto TeX, da linguagem de definição de fontes METAFONT relacionada e do sistema de renderização, e da família de fontes modernas Computer Modern. É também conhecido por ter criado a "bíblia" dos programadores - o TAOCP - The Art of Computer Programming. Na década de 1970, Knuth descreveu a ciência da computação como "um campo totalmente novo, sem identidade real. E o padrão de publicações disponíveis não era assim tão alto. Muitos dos trabalhos publicados estavam simplesmente errados ... Então, uma das minhas motivações foi para endireitar uma história que foi muito mal contada. ". Em 2011, os três primeiros volumes e a primeira parte do volume quatro de sua série foram publicados.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou está a decorrer a CES 2019. Esta feira que decorre entre os dias 8 e 11 de Janeiro em Las Vegas e tem cerca de 4500 expositores é marcada habitualmente por lançamento de produtos por parte dos fabricantes de tecnologia e este ano não foi excepção.
Uma das noticias que destaco é a apresentação por parte da Hyundai do seu veiculo prototipo de resposta a catástrofes naturais. O conceito Elevate é baseado numa plataforma EV modular com a capacidade de alternar diferentes corpos para situações específicas. A arquitectura da perna robótica tem cinco graus de liberdade, além de motores de propulsão e é habilitada pelo mais recente em tecnologia de actuadores eléctricos. Este projecto é exclusivamente capaz de andar com os passos dos mamíferos e repteis, permitindo que ele se mova em qualquer direcção.
Outra noticia desta semana, também vinda da CES 2019 é a apresentação por parte da IBM do primeiro sistema de computação quântica integrado para uso comercial. O IBM Q System One foi projectado para lidar um dia com problemas que actualmente são considerados de natureza muito complexa e exponencial para os sistemas clássicos. Aplicações futuras da computação quântica podem incluir encontrar novas maneiras de modelar dados financeiros e isolar os principais factores de risco globais para fazer melhores investimentos, ou encontrar o melhor caminho entre os sistemas globais para logística ultra-eficiente e optimizar as operações de frota para entregas.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como alguns modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis.</p>

<p><em>"Any first responder will tell you that the first 72 hours following a natural disaster are the most crucial to saving lives. However, often times duetothe nature of the disaster (forest fire, earthquake,hurricane,or flood), it can be difficult for search-and-rescue and humanitarian aid missions to reach and get immediate help to those in need. The need for efficient, rapid, resilient transportation for disaster assistance is what led Hyundai to develop the first-ever vehicle with moveable legs. Elevate is the first Ultimate Mobility Vehicle (UMV), blending technology found in electric cars and robots, which allowsit to traverse terrain beyond the limitations of even the most capable off-road vehicle. “When a tsunami or earthquakehits, current rescue vehicles can only deliver first responders to the edge of the debris field. They have to go the rest of the way by foot."</em> <a href="https://www.hyundai.com/worldwide/en/news/news-room/news/hyundai-walking-car-concept-is-the-future-of-the-first-responder-industry-0000016100?type[]=RES&amp;category=News&amp;listPageUrl=news.release.all">[...]</a>

<p><em>"At the 2019 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), IBM (NYSE: IBM) today unveiled IBM Q System One™, the world's first integrated universal approximate quantum computing system designed for scientific and commercial use. IBM also announced plans to open its first IBM Q Quantum Computation Center for commercial clients in Poughkeepsie, New York in 2019. IBM Q systems are designed to one day tackle problems that are currently seen as too complex and exponential in nature for classical systems to handle. Future applications of quantum computing may include finding new ways to model financial data and isolating key global risk factors to make better investments, or finding the optimal path across global systems for ultra-efficient logistics and optimizing fleet operations for deliveries. Designed by IBM scientists, systems engineers and industrial designers, IBM Q System One has a sophisticated, modular and compact design optimized for stability, reliability and continuous commercial use. For the first time ever, IBM Q System One enables universal approximate superconducting quantum computers to operate beyond the confines of the research lab."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2019-01-08-IBM-Unveils-Worlds-First-Integrated-Quantum-Computing-System-for-Commercial-Use">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7313">Citizen Scientists Find New World with NASA Telescope</a></h2>

<p><em>"Using data from NASA's Kepler space telescope, citizen scientists have discovered a planet roughly twice the size of Earth located within its star's habitable zone, the range of orbital distances where liquid water may exist on the planet's surface. The new world, known as K2-288Bb, could be rocky or could be a gas-rich planet similar to Neptune. Its size is rare among exoplanets - planets beyond our solar system. "It's a very exciting discovery due to how it was found, its temperate orbit and because planets of this size seem to be relatively uncommon," said Adina Feinstein, a University of Chicago graduate student who discussed the discovery on Monday, Jan. 7, at the 233rd meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Seattle. She is also the lead author of a paper describing the new planet accepted for publication by The Astronomical Journal. Located 226 light-years away in the constellation Taurus, the planet lies in a stellar system known as K2-288, which contains a pair of dim, cool M-type stars separated by about 5.1 billion miles (8.2 billion kilometers) - roughly six times the distance between Saturn and the Sun."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7313">[...]</a>

We view it as a moral imperative to pursue a future with autonomous vehicles (AV), but to not wait for it when we have the technology to help save more lives today. We fundamentally also believe that everything we do must scale, and we constantly search for the best ways to match our technology to market needs. Founded on the idea that we could use computer vision technology to help save lives on the road, Mobileye became a pioneer in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). These capabilities are now scaling up to become the building blocks for a fully autonomous vehicle.

The mission’s sensitive cameras also captured 100 short-lived changes — most of them likely stellar outbursts — in the same region of the sky. They include six supernova explosions whose brightening light was recorded by TESS even before the outbursts were discovered by ground-based telescopes. The new discoveries show that TESS is delivering on its goal of discovering planets around nearby bright stars.

<p><em>"Plants convert sunlight into energy through photosynthesis; however, most crops on the planet are plagued by a photosynthetic glitch, and to deal with it, evolved an energy-expensive process called photorespiration that drastically suppresses their yield potential. Today, researchers from the University of Illinois and U.S. Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service report in the journal Science that crops engineered with a photorespiratory shortcut are 40 percent more productive in real-world agronomic conditions. “We could feed up to 200 million additional people with the calories lost to photorespiration in the Midwestern U.S. each year,” said principal investigator Donald Ort (GEGC leader/BSD/CABBI), Robert Emerson Professor of Plant Science and Crop Sciences. “Reclaiming even a portion of these calories across the world would go a long way to meeting the 21st Century’s rapidly expanding food demands—driven by population growth and more affluent high-calorie diets.” This landmark study is part of Realizing Increased Photosynthetic Efficiency (RIPE), an international research project that is engineering crops to photosynthesize more efficiently to sustainably increase worldwide food productivity with support from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research (FFAR), and the U.K. Government’s Department for International Development (DFID). Photosynthesis uses the enzyme Rubisco—the planet’s most abundant protein—and sunlight energy to turn carbon dioxide and water into sugars that fuel plant growth and yield. Over millennia, Rubisco has become a victim of its own success, creating an oxygen-rich atmosphere."</em> <a href="https://research.aces.illinois.edu/content/scientists-engineer-shortcut-photosynthetic-glitch-boost-crop-growth-40-percent">[...]</a>

The event, known as a tidal disruption flare, for the black hole’s massive tidal pull that tears a star apart, created a burst of X-ray activity near the center of the galaxy. Since then, a host of observatories have trained their sights on the event, in hopes of learning more about how black holes feed. Now researchers at MIT and elsewhere have pored through data from multiple telescopes’ observations of the event, and discovered a curiously intense, stable, and periodic pulse, or signal, of X-rays, across all datasets.

<p><em>"It automatically supplies meals to your pet at preset times, by providing the daily dose of cat kibble. Having a pet involves big responsibilities, first of all granting them food; unfortunately, a hectic lifestyle and imposed workhours do not go hand-in-hand with the needs of our four-legged friends, and surely anyone living on their own will have a hard time providing the pets meals on schedule. In order to solve a problem that is surely dear to any pet owner, and especially cat and dog owners, we have designed a device we called FelixMatic: it is a practical automatic dispenser of dry food for cats (or small dogs) equipped with a high-capacity container that can easily be opened from the top and a bowl to collect the kibble when it is supplied. We know we can already find automatic dispensers on the market, however, our example is unique because it can be programmed with 9 meals a day in order to supply very precise quantities of dry food. The project The way the dispenser works is more complex and complete than the average available product on the market, in fact, it does not only supply food but it also gives exact doses as decided by us; basically, at a preset time, a cochlea at the base of the container will turn, and drop a certain amount of kibble in the bowl, regulated by a dedicated weight sensor. In order to have this kind of functioning, our dispenser is composed of a mechanical and an electronic section; the former has been assembled with PLA, 3-D printed parts, while the electronic section is composed of an Arduino UNO board to which we have applied an RTC Shield, a specific shield with an LCD display, a model-making continuous rotation servo and a load cell; the latter is used to weigh the amount of dry food, and once we reach the desired quantity, the servo operating the cochlea stops."</em> <a href="https://www.open-electronics.org/automatic-dispenser-for-cats/">[...]</a>

Wifi based home automation products are cheaper compared to zigbee or z-wave products, but the downside is, wifi devices need internet connection to perform their function. Letting your home devices controlled by a bunch of cloud servers on the internet may not be the best idea. Internet connectivity for home devices should be optional - user should be incharge of deciding whether he/she wants to expose the home-devices to internet(may be for remote monitoring/controlling purpose), but in today's world, there are so called "alexa"/"google-home" compliant wifi devices who insist on internet else they wont work. Thanks to the opensource community(tasmota/espurna/etc) for helping us to jailbreak those wifi devices like sonoff/blitzwolf/teckin/etc.. but jailbreaking solves part of the problem, still the need for a home-automation gateway is a challenge and requires some advanced knowledge of setting-up wifi_access_point + mqtt_broker + automation_gateway_server(ex: domoticz/openHab).

<p><em>"So, recently my mobile' s audio jack stopped working and hence I couldn't listen to music or watch youtube which is a pretty big deal for a teenager like me. This project was born out of necessity rather than just a fun project to work on. It's not a very complicated project. Hope this instructable helps!

<p><em>"Use a joystick to control a classic drawing toy through two DC motors. The Etch A Sketch is a drawing toy with a thick, flat gray screen in a red plastic frame. There are two white knobs on the front of the frame in the lower corners. Twisting the knobs moves a stylus that displaces aluminum powder on the back of the screen, leaving a solid line. - wikipedia This toy is basically a simple two-axis plotter, so with a few geared DC motors, you can easily add additional functionality using a joystick (or Wii remote) to control it. Materials: - Arduino - Breadboard - Jumper wires - Wii Nunchuck - Etch A Sketch - DC motors - H-bridge - Some 3D-printed parts"</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/millerman4487/etch-a-sketch-joystick-0f7af0">[...]</a>

<p><em>"It started as a bet: The “Phantom of the Floppera” video was making the rounds at work and a co-worker was sure that the video was fake. “They just dubbed audio over a video of some old computer,” he said. “Nonsense,” I said. “It’s not even that hard! I bet I could go home tonight and do it!” After many hours and a lot of trial and error, my salvaged floppy drive eked out the first few bars of “Ode to Joy,” only a little bit out of tune. Floppy disks have several “tracks” of information on their circular media, and the drives that read them have a head that can step one track at a time across their surface."</em> <a href="https://makezine.com/projects/how-to-create-floppy-drive-music/">[...]</a>
