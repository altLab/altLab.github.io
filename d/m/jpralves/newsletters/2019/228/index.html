<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1812, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_March_Hoe">Richard March Hoe</a>. Este Inventor americano desenvolveu e fabricou a primeira prensa rotativa de sucesso em 1846. Um cilindro rolou sobre placas fixas com tinta e provoca uma impressão no papel. Isto eliminou a necessidade de fazer impressões directamente das próprias placas, que eram pesadas e difíceis de manobrar. Ao girar constantemente em apenas uma direcção, a impressora rotativa Hoe aumentou o número de páginas que podiam ser impressas por hora.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1818, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Jordan_Gatling">Richard Jordan Gatling</a>. Este inventor norte-americano, tem na metralhadora Gatling (1861) a primeira metralhadora bem-sucedida, um desenho com múltiplos canos de accionamento rápido com manivela que combina fiabilidade, alta taxa de disparo e facilidade de carregamento num único dispositivo. O seu pai também foi um inventor e, quando jovem, Richard ajudou-o a criar máquinas para semear e desbaste de algodão. Em 1839, ele projectou uma hélice de parafuso para barcos a vapor, mas descobriu que uma similar já tinha sido patenteada anteriormente. Desde 1844, ele continuou a inventar máquinas agrícolas, incluindo uma para plantar grãos, como arroz e trigo (adaptado da máquina de semear algodão); uma máquina de quebrar o cânhamo (1850); e um arado a vapor (1857). A eclosão da Guerra Civil Americana levou-o a projetar armas de fogo (1861).</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1897 - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ir%C3%A8ne_Joliot-Curie">Irène Joliot-Curie</a>. Esta física francesa, esposa de Frédéric Joliot-Curie, partilhou o Prémio Nobel de Química de 1935 "em reconhecimento à síntese de novos elementos radioactivos". Por exemplo, na suas pesquisas conjuntas, eles descobriram que átomos de alumínio expostos a raios alfa transformavam-se em átomos de fósforo radioactivo. Ela era filha dos vencedores do Prémio Nobel Pierre e Marie Curie. Desde 1946, ela foi directora do Radium Institute, Paris, fundada por sua mãe. Ela morreu de leucemia, como sua mãe, resultante da exposição à radiação durante a pesquisa.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1900, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_Curry">Haskell Curry</a>. Este matemático norte-americano foi pioneiro da lógica matemática moderna. A sua pesquisa nos fundamentos da matemática levou-o ao desenvolvimento da lógica combinatória. Mais tarde, este trabalho seminal encontrou aplicação significativa na ciência da computação, especialmente no desenho de linguagens de programação. Curry trabalhou no primeiro computador electrónico, chamado ENIAC, durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial. Ele também formulou um cálculo lógico usando regras inferenciais. Em 1942, ele publicou o paradoxo de Curry, que ocorre na teoria dos conjuntos ou na lógica ingénua, e permite a derivação de uma sentença arbitrária de uma sentença auto-referente e de algumas regras de dedução lógica aparentemente inócuas.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que os planos da Índia de ser a 5a potência a colocar um objecto feito pelo Homem na Lua falharam. Embora a sonda Vikram tenha aterrado na superfície lunar, não foi até ao momento possível estabelecer contacto com a mesma. De acordo com a Agência Espacial Indiana, ISRO, a descida da sonda prosseguiu normalmente até uma altitude de 2,1 km acima da Lua. Após esse período, a comunicação foi perdida com a nave-espacial. Os dados da descida serão analisados para avaliar melhor o que de errado aconteceu com a tentativa de aterragem.</p>

<p>Também esta semana que passou foi anunciado que o investigador matemático Drew Sutherland ajudou a resolver o quebra-cabeça de soma de três cubos há décadas, com a ajuda do "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.". Uma equipa liderada por Andrew Sutherland, do MIT, e Andrew Booker, da Universidade de Bristol, resolveu a peça final de um famoso quebra-cabeça de matemática de 65 anos com uma resposta para o número mais esquivo de todos: 42.</p>

<p>O número 42 é especialmente importante para os fãs do "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy", do escritor Douglas Adams, porque esse número é a resposta dada por um supercomputador à "Questão Final da Vida, do Universo e de Tudo". Booker também queria saber a resposta para 42. Ou seja, existem três cubos cuja soma é 42?
Esta soma de três cubos, iniciada em 1954 na Universidade de Cambridge e conhecida como Equação Diofantina x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = k, desafiou os matemáticos a encontrar soluções para os números de 1 a 100. Com números menores, esse tipo de equação é mais fácil de resolver: por exemplo, 29 podem ser escritos como 33 + 13 + 13, enquanto 32 é insolúvel. Todos foram finalmente resolvidos, ou provados insolúveis, usando várias técnicas e supercomputadores, excepto por dois números: 33 e 42.
Foi através do uso da rede Charity Engine que Sutherland e Booker executaram os cálculos por vários meses, mas a execução final bem-sucedida foi concluída à apenas algumas semanas. Quando o email do Charity Engine chegou, ele forneceu a primeira solução para x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 42:</p>

<p>42 = (-80538738812075974)^3 + 80435758145817515^3 + 12602123297335631^3</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. É apresentado também um livro sobre "Competitive Programmer".</p>

After this time communication was lost with the spacecraft. Data from the descent will be analyzed to further assess what went wrong with the landing attempt. Original post: In late July, an Indian rocket launched the Chandrayaan-2 mission from a spaceport in the Bay of Bengal. This is the second spacecraft India has sent to the Moon and the first to attempt a soft landing. Since launching, the Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft has spent the last six weeks spiraling toward lunar orbit, reaching it, and releasing a lander that will attempt to reach the surface."</em> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/09/the-day-has-come-for-india-to-try-for-a-historic-moon-landing/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Most development work on self-driving cars focuses on mundane things like getting around parked cars and keeping bugs off sensors, but what about speed? Roborace is trying to develop a racing series for autonomous cars, and has set a Guinness World Record for the world’s fastest self-driving car at 175.49 mph. Roborace’s autonomous race car, dubbed Robocar, made its record runs at Elvington Airfield in the United Kingdom, with Guinness adjudicators on hand. The attempt was made in March, but an official announcement was postponed to coincide with the publication of Guinness’ 2020 record book. Because there was no existing self-driving car top speed record to aim for, Guinness set 160 mph as the unofficial record the Robocar needed to beat. As is standard procedure for top-speed records, officials took the average of runs in opposite directions to come up with the final number."</em> <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/roborace-sets-record-world-fastest-155704719.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/answer-life-universe-and-everything-sum-three-cubes-mathematics-0910">The answer to life, the universe, and everything</a></h2>

<p><em>"Mathematics researcher Drew Sutherland helps solve decades-old sum-of-three-cubes puzzle, with help from "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy." A team led by Andrew Sutherland of MIT and Andrew Booker of Bristol University has solved the final piece of a famous 65-year old math puzzle with an answer for the most elusive number of all: 42. The number 42 is especially significant to fans of science fiction novelist Douglas Adams’ “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy,” because that number is the answer given by a supercomputer to “the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.” Booker also wanted to know the answer to 42. That is, are there three cubes whose sum is 42? This sum of three cubes puzzle, first set in 1954 at the University of Cambridge and known as the Diophantine Equation x3+y3+z3=k, challenged mathematicians to find solutions for numbers 1-100. With smaller numbers, this type of equation is easier to solve: for example, 29 could be written as 33 + 13 + 13, while 32 is unsolvable."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/answer-life-universe-and-everything-sum-three-cubes-mathematics-0910">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Göttingen researchers develop a new method allowing ten-fold improvement in optical resolution Researchers at the University of Göttingen have developed a new method that takes advantage of the unusual properties of graphene to electromagnetically interact with fluorescing (light-emitting) molecules. This method allows scientists to optically measure extremely small distances, in the order of 1 ångström (one ten-billionth of a meter) with high accuracy and reproducibility for the first time. This enabled researchers to optically measure the thickness of lipid bilayers, the stuff that makes the membranes of all living cells. The results were published in Nature Photonics. Researchers from the University of Göttingen led by Professor Enderlein used a single sheet of graphene, just one atom thick (0.34 nm), to modulate the emission of light-emitting (fluorescent) molecules when they came close to the graphene sheet. The excellent optical transparency of graphene and its capability to modulate through space the molecules’ emission made it an extremely sensitive tool for measuring the distance of single molecules from the graphene sheet."</em> <a href="https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/3240.html?id=5580">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have demonstrated a new type of sensor that uses atoms to receive commonly used communications signals. This atom-based receiver has the potential to be smaller and work better in noisy environments than conventional radio receivers, among other possible advantages. The NIST team used cesium atoms to receive digital bits (1s and 0s) in the most common communications format, which is used in cell phones, Wi-Fi and satellite TV, for example. In this format, called phase shifting or phase modulation, radio signals or other electromagnetic waves are shifted relative to one another over time. The information (or data) is encoded in this modulation. “The point is to demonstrate one can use atoms to receive modulated signals,” project leader Chris Holloway said."</em> <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2019/09/nist-team-shows-atoms-can-receive-common-communications-signals">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In power electronics, semiconductors are based on the element silicon – but the energy efficiency of silicon carbide would be much higher. Physicists of the University of Basel, the Paul Scherrer Institute and ABB explain what exactly is preventing the use of this combination of silicon and carbon in the scientific journal Applied Physics Letters. Energy consumption is growing across the globe; electric power is being relied upon more and more, and sustainable energy supplies such as wind and solar power are becoming increasingly important. Electric power, however, is often generated a long distance away from the consumer. Efficient distribution and transport systems are thus just as crucial as transformer stations and power converters that turn the generated direct current into alternating current. Huge savings are possible Modern power electronics must be able to handle large currents and high voltages."</em> <a href="https://www.unibas.ch/en/News-Events/News/Uni-Research/Silicon-as-a-semiconductor--silicon-carbide-would-be-much-more-efficient.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Light-emitting diodes made of indium gallium nitride provide better luminescence efficiency than many of the other materials used to create blue and green LEDs. But a big challenge of working with InGaN is the material is known for dislocation density defects that make it difficult to understand its emission properties. In the Journal of Applied Physics, from AIP Publishing, researchers in China report an InGaN LED structure with high luminescence efficiency and what is believed to be the first direct observation of transition carriers between different localization states within InGaN. The localization states were confirmed by temperature-dependent photoluminescence and excitation power-dependent photoluminescence. Localization states theory is commonly used to explain the high luminescence efficiency gained via the large number of dislocations within InGaN materials.

<p><em>"Superconductivity enables us to prevent loss when transporting energy from power plants to our homes. However, to do this, the lines must be cooled to temperatures that are so low as to make large-scale use of superconductors uneconomic at present. Therefore, in laboratories across the world researchers are looking for new superconductive materials that function at less prohibitive temperatures. Great hope rests on so-called cuprates, copper and oxygen based compounds also called high-temperature superconductors, where the scientific community is focusing its efforts. An experiment conducted at the ESRF (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility), the European source of synchrotron-generated light, in Grenoble, coordinated by the Department of Physics at the Politecnico di Milano, with researchers from the Spin Institute from the National Research Council, Sapienza Università di Roma and the Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, has revealed a new property of these materials: the presence of a variety of charge density waves called dynamical charge density fluctuations.

The smallest distance that optical devices can reliably image is equal to half the wavelength of the light used, known as the “diffraction limit”. The diffraction limit is therefore above 400 nanometres, about half the wavelength of near infrared light. This is some 250 times smaller than the width of a human hair (100 microns).

In a bid to develop alternative designs for lithium-based batteries with less reliance on those scarce metals, researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have developed a promising new cathode and electrolyte system that replaces expensive metals and traditional liquid electrolyte with lower cost transition metal fluorides and a solid polymer electrolyte. “Electrodes made from transition metal fluorides have long shown stability problems and rapid failure, leading to significant skepticism about their ability to be used in next generation batteries,” said Gleb Yushin, a professor in Georgia Tech’s School of Materials Science and Engineering. “But we’ve shown that when used with a solid polymer electrolyte, the metal fluorides show remarkable stability – even at higher temperatures – which could eventually lead to safer, lighter and cheaper lithium-ion batteries.” In a typical lithium-ion battery, energy is released during the transfer of lithium ions between two electrodes – an anode and a cathode, with a cathode typically comprising lithium and transition metals such as cobalt, nickel and manganese. The ions flow between the electrodes through a liquid electrolyte. For the study, which was published Sept. 9 in the journal Nature Materials and sponsored by the Army Research Office, the research team fabricated a new type of cathode from iron fluoride active material and a solid polymer electrolyte nanocomposite."</em> <a href="https://www.news.gatech.edu/2019/09/09/stretchy-plastic-electrolytes-could-enable-new-lithium-ion-battery-design">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The purpose of this book is to give you a thorough introduction to competitive programming. It is assumed that you already know the basics of programming, but no previous background in competitive programming is needed. The book is especially intended for students who want to learn algorithms and possibly participate in the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) or in the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC). Of course, the book is also suitable for anybody else interested in competitive programming. It takes a long time to become a good competitive programmer, but it is also an opportunity to learn a lot. You can be sure that you will get a good general understanding of algorithms if you spend time reading the book, solving problems and taking part in contests."</em> <a href="https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf">[...]</a>

But because the machine table of my DIY CNC is not perfectly even, I wanted to use it for autoleveling on non-conductive surfaces, like acrylic. For conductive surfaces, you can just clip a crocodile clip to the milling bit and one to the material and as soon as the bit touches the surface, that completes the circuit which will trigger the probe input. So the BLTouch is not needed in this case. The probe is simply controlled, by sending pulses of different widths."</em> <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/167359-autoleveling-with-a-bltouch-on-a-cnc-machine">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The 50th anniversary of the Apollo mission brought around lots of projects and talks about the technology that made the mission possible. One item that always fascinated me is "magnetic core memory", a type of RAM made of tiny ferrite beads that store a bit by being magnetized in one direction or another. A close relative of "magnetic core memory" is "core rope memory" which, instead, is a ROM. I started to experiment with a toroid core I had in my parts bin and, after a bit of fumbling, came up with a single bit that could be driven directly by a microcontroller, whithout additional driver circuitry. Let's be clear, this is a bit stretching things as the drive line is a dead short to ground and relies solely on the current limiation of your microcontroller output circuitry. While this might not be best practice, and it surely isn't, it works beautifully at least on the Atmega 328."</em> <a href="https://github.com/nicolacimmino/CoreRopeMemoryBlinker">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In this video, we will create a link drop sensor with an ESP32 and a SIM800. This means that with this project, we can verify the connection to the internet, and in the event of a connection failure, call a telephone number to notify that the network is in trouble. This is one many ways you can perform this type of monitoring. While it's simple, it allows you to test various devices that may exist within your CPD. Its power of check becomes much greater when using the ESP32. Though I use WiFi in this example, you can use wired internet, if you prefer."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/What-If-Your-Link-Crashes/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/joeycastillo/The-Open-Book">The Open Book Project</a></h2>

<p><em>"THE PREMISE: As a society, we need an open source device for reading. Books are among the most important documents of our culture, yet the most popular and widespread devices we have for reading — the Kobo, the Nook, the Kindle and even the iPad — are closed devices, operating as small moving parts in a set of giant closed platforms whose owners' interests are not always aligned with readers'. The Open Book aims to be a simple device that anyone with a soldering iron can build for themselves. The Open Book should be comprehensible: the reader should be able to look at it and understand, at least in broad strokes, how it works. It should be extensible, so that a reader with different needs can write code and add accessories that make the book work for them. It should be global, supporting readers of books in all the languages of the world."</em> <a href="https://github.com/joeycastillo/The-Open-Book">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Ever asked how to control any device from any place in the world? In this tutorial, we'll learn how to control things wirelessly over WiFi. Introduction Today, we will build a device that connects to the internet and allow the user to control his/her home remotely over wifi. we will use the Arduino board(any model will do the job well) with the ESP8266-01 wifi module to make this device. Let’s get started! What’s a smart home?"</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/ahmedibrrahim/iot-using-esp8266-01-and-arduino-afa35e">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Introduction The SparkFun Pulse Oximeter and Heart Rate Monitor is an I²C based biometric sensor. Utilizing two chips from Maxim Integrated, the SparkFun Pulse Oximeter and Heart Rate Monitor has both the MAX30101 biometric sensor and MAX32664 biometric hub. While the former does all the sensing, the latter is an incredibly small and fast Cortex M4 processor that handles all of the algorithmic calculations, digital filtering, pressure/position compensation, advanced R-wave detection and automatic gain control. We've combined them and written an Arduino Library with example code demonstrating basic to advanced features to help get you started utilizing the SparkFun Pulse Oximeter and Heart Rate Monitor into your next project. Or if you're looking to put these IC's into a final product, Maxim has provided some features to get FDA approval. Let's get started!"</em> <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-pulse-oximeter-and-heart-rate-monitor-hookup-guide/all">[...]</a>
