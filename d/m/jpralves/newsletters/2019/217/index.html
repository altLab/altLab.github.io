<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1806, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus_De_Morgan">Augustus De Morgan</a>. Este matemático e lógico inglês fez um trabalho importante na lógica simbólica abstrata, a teoria das relações e formulou as leis de De Morgan: um é "NÃO (A E B) = (NÃO A) OU (NÃO B)" e o outro é "NÃO (A OU B) = (NÃO A) E (NÃO B)". Estas leis continuam a ser aplicadas na teoria da prova moderna e na programação de software. Quando ele definiu e introduziu o termo "indução matemática" (1838), ele deu ao processo uma base e clareza rigorosas que antes não tinham. Ele originou o uso da barra para representar fracções, como em 1/5 ou 3/7. Em Trigonometria e Álgebra Dupla (1849) ele deu uma interpretação geométrica de números complexos.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1901, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merle_Tuve">Merle Antony Tuve</a>. Este Físico e geofísico  norte-americano fez o primeiro uso de ondas de rádio pulsadas para explorar a ionosfera. Ele inventou o equipamento de detecção necessário para medir o tempo entre receber um pulso de rádio directo e um segundo pulso reflectido da ionosfera. As observações que ele fez forneceram a base teórica para o desenvolvimento do radar. Tuve, com Lawrence R. Hafstad e Norman P. Heydenburg, fizeram as primeiras e definitivas medições da força nuclear entre a força protão-protão nas distâncias nucleares. Durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial, ele desenvolveu o fusível de proximidade. Após a guerra, ele fez importantes contribuições para a sismologia experimental, a radioastronomia e a astronomia óptica.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficamos a conhecer a nova versão do Raspberry PI - 4. Continuando com o custo que nos habituou esta versão introduz um conjunto de novidades que passam pela existência de três versões da Board. De base todas elas equipadas com um micro-controlador ARM Cortex-A72 Quad-Core a 1.5GHz, uma interface Ethernet a Gigagit, wireless 802.11ac de banda dupla, Bluetooth 5.0, duas portas USB 3.0, duas portas USB 2.0, suporte micro-HDMI para duas saídas de vídeo até 4Kp60, GPI VideoCore VI. As três versões são de 1GB, 2GB ou 4GB de RAM. De notar que a disposição das interfaces foi alterada o que requer novas caixas. Também a alimentação passou a ser feita por USB-C para ultrapassar as limitações de potência que a interface micro-USB tinha permitindo o Raspberry PI 4 poder consumir mais.</p>

<p>Também esta semana ficámos a saber que no passado dia 25 a SpaceX lançou o STP-2 (Space Test Program-2). Este programa procedeu ao lançamento com sucesso de 24 satélites. Estes irão testar inúmeros factores que são necessários analisar em preparação para uma futura missão a Marte. Destes destacam-se os E-TBEx que irão explorar as bolhas nas camadas electricamente carregadas da atmosfera superior da Terra, que podem interromper as comunicações e os sinais GPS nos quais confiamos todos os dias, o "Deep Space Atomic Clock" que é um relógio atómico exclusivo que testará uma nova forma das naves espaciais navegarem no espaço profundo. A tecnologia pode tornar a navegação semelhante a um GPS possível na Lua e em Marte. O GPIM que testará um novo sistema de propulsão que funciona com um combustível não tóxico de alto desempenho de nave espacial. Esta tecnologia poderá ajudar a impulsionar constelações de pequenos satélites dentro e fora da órbita terrestre baixa. Ainda faz parte deste lançamento o DSX que a bordo transporta um instrumento projectado pelo JPL para medir vibrações de naves espaciais e quatro experiências da NASA que compõem os Testbeds de Ambiente Espacial (SET). A SET estudará como proteger melhor os satélites da radiação espacial, analisando o ambiente hostil do espaço próximo da Terra e testando várias estratégias para mitigar os impactos. Estas informações podem ser usadas para melhorar o projecto, a engenharia e as operações das naves, a fim de proteger as mesmas contra radiações nocivas causadas pelo Sol.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como um modelo 3D que poderá ser útil. É apresentada a revista MagPI Nº83, o livro The Official Raspberry Pi Beginner’s Guide – 2nd Edition e a revista newelectronics de 11 de Junho.</p>

<p><em>"NASA technology demonstrations, which one day could help the agency get astronauts to Mars, and science missions, which will look at the space environment around Earth and how it affects us, have launched into space on a Falcon Heavy rocket. The NASA missions lifted off at 2:30 a.m. EDT Tuesday from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, as part of the Department of Defense’s Space Test Program-2 (STP-2) launch. “This launch was a true partnership across government and industry, and it marked an incredible first for the U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center,” said Jim Reuter, associate administrator for NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate. “The NASA missions aboard the Falcon Heavy also benefited from strong collaborations with industry, academia and other government organizations.” The missions, each with a unique set of objectives, will aid in smarter spacecraft design and benefit the agency’s Moon to Mars exploration plans by providing greater insight into the effects of radiation in space and testing an atomic clock that could change how spacecraft navigate. With launch and deployments complete, the missions will start to power on, communicate with Earth and collect data. They each will operate for about a year, providing enough time to mature the technologies and collect valuable science data."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-technology-missions-launch-on-spacex-falcon-heavy">[...]</a>

<p><em>"NASA is sending a new technology to space in late June that will change the way we navigate our spacecraft — even how we send astronauts to Mars and beyond. Built by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, the Deep Space Atomic Clock is a technology demonstration that will help spacecraft navigate autonomously through deep space. No larger than a toaster oven, the instrument will be tested in Earth orbit for one year, with the goal of being ready for future missions to other worlds. Here are five key facts to know about NASA's Deep Space Atomic Clock: It works a lot like GPS The Deep Space Atomic Clock is a sibling of the atomic clocks you interact with every day on your smart phone. Atomic clocks aboard satellites enable your phone's GPS application to get you from point A to point B by calculating where you are on Earth, based on the time it takes the signal to travel from the satellite to your phone. But spacecraft don't have GPS to help them find their way in deep space; instead, navigation teams rely on atomic clocks on Earth to determine location data."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/five-things-to-know-about-nasas-deep-space-atomic-clock">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Making life easier for STM32* microcontroller (MCU) and microprocessor (MPU) users, and further strengthening the STM32Cube ecosystem, the latest version of the STM32CubeProgrammer from STMicroelectronics gathers the capabilities of multiple device programmers into just one universal tool. STM32CubeProgrammer lets users program their devices through any convenient connection, choosing from the MCU’s JTAG or single-wire debug (SWD) pins, a UART, or USB, SPI, I2C, or CAN interfaces. The new multi-OS software replaces several tools including ST Visual Programmer (STVP), DFuSe USB Device Firmware Upgrade programmer, Windows®-only STM32 Flash loader, and software utilities for use with ST-Link, to deliver maximum flexibility with the benefits of a consistent unified environment. From now on, new STM32 products will be supported only by STM32CubeProgrammer. Built-in features include the STM32 Trusted Package Creator, which protects OEMs’ intellectual property by encrypting firmware using an AES-GCM key and working with the STM32HSM-V1 companion Hardware Security Module (HSM).

<p><em>"DisplayPort 2.0 enables up to 3X increase in video bandwidth performance (max payload of 77.37 Gbps); new built-in features enable improved user experience, greater flexibility and improved power efficiency SAN JOSE, Calif. – June 26, 2019 – The Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA®) today announced that it has released version 2.0 of the DisplayPort™ (DP) audio/video standard. DP 2.0 is the first major update to the DisplayPort standard since March 2016, and provides up to a 3X increase in data bandwidth performance compared to the previous version of DisplayPort (DP 1.4a), as well as new capabilities to address the future performance requirements of traditional displays. These include beyond 8K resolutions, higher refresh rates and high dynamic range (HDR) support at higher resolutions, improved support for multiple display configurations, as well as improved user experience with augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR) displays, including support for 4K-and-beyond VR resolutions. The advantages of DP 2.0 are enjoyed across both the native DP connector as well as the USB Type-C connector, which carries the DP audio/video signal through DisplayPort Alt Mode. DP 2.0 is backward compatible with previous versions of DisplayPort and incorporates all of the key features of DP 1.4a, including support for visually lossless Display Stream Compression (DSC) with Forward Error Correction (FEC), HDR metadata transport, and other advanced features. The increased video bandwidth performance of DP 2.0 carried over the USB-C connector enables simultaneous higher-speed USB data transfer without compromising display performance."</em> <a href="https://vesa.org/press/vesa-publishes-displayport-2-0-video-standard-enabling-support-for-beyond-8k-resolutions-higher-refresh-rates-for-4k-hdr-and-virtual-reality-applications/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.space.com/june-asteroid-zip-by-earth.html">Asteroid That's 3 Times As Long As a Football Field Will Whiz by Earth Thursday</a></h2>

<p><em>"Summer is the season for tourists, and that includes a cosmic traveler — one that's three times the length of a football field — that's expected to visit Earth's neighborhood later this week. We're using the term "neighborhood" loosely here; the heavenly tourist (yes, it's an asteroid), known as 2008 KV2, is expected to zip by at a distance of about 4.2 million miles (6.7 million kilometers) from Earth on Thursday (June 27). But even though this visitor will be far away, the event's still notable; it's not every day that such a big space rock hurtles by our planet. To put 2008 KV2's distance from Earth into perspective, the moon is about 238,900 miles (384,400 km) away from us, and the asteroid will be more than 17 times that distance. Scientists discovered the asteroid in 2008 and promptly set about calculating how often it came within Earth's vicinity; the researchers produced estimates of its travels between 1900 and 2199. It turns out, 2008 KV2 is a fairly frequent visitor."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/june-asteroid-zip-by-earth.html">[...]</a>

Advancing our search for the building blocks of life, the Dragonfly mission will fly multiple sorties to sample and examine sites around Saturn’s icy moon. Dragonfly will launch in 2026 and arrive in 2034. The rotorcraft will fly to dozens of promising locations on Titan looking for prebiotic chemical processes common on both Titan and Earth. Dragonfly marks the first time NASA will fly a multi-rotor vehicle for science on another planet; it has eight rotors and flies like a large drone.

<p><em>"We have tracked a strange blast of cosmic radio waves back to its home galaxy. This is the second time such a trace has been possible, but the differences from the first one may require us to rethink our ideas of what causes these so-called fast radio bursts (FRBs). For just 1.3 milliseconds on 24 September, 2018, a barrage of radio waves arrived from space. It was pure luck that all 36 of the antennae that make up the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) were pointed in the same direction, towards the area in the sky where the FRB flashed. That allowed researchers to combine data from all of the antennae and calculate where in the universe it came from – around 13,000 light years from the centre of its home galaxy, which is 4 billion light years away from us. “This is a magnificent technical achievement,” says Shami Chatterjee at Cornell University in New York."</em> <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2207854-mystery-radio-waves-from-space-tracked-to-a-surprising-home-galaxy/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"As IoT devices proliferate, our focus is shifting toward optimizing Arm Mbed OS to best address the use cases our customers face. In 5.13, we have reduced the number of new features we’re delivering and have instead concentrated on specific optimizations of existing features that benefit our customers. As with our 5.12 release, the new features we’ve released are primarily concentrated on security, which remains the key challenge in IoT product development, and connectivity. Separation of Mbed TLS and Mbed Crypto As our security services in Mbed OS have evolved to meet the requirements of Arm’s Platform Security Architecture (PSA), we have separated the cryptographic capabilities from the network security components of Mbed TLS into two distinct libraries: Mbed TLS remains the cornerstone of embedded network security, and Mbed Crypto delivers support for crypto hardware under the PSA Crypto APIs. This provides a clear way to use cryptography to secure data while the device both communicates and stores it. With the new APIs, you can also abstract how cryptographic functions are provided: through hardware acceleration, a software-only implementation or through a separate secure execution environment provided by either a secure element, a dual core v7-M platform or a v8-M platform with TrustZone."</em> <a href="https://os.mbed.com/blog/entry/mbed-os-513-released/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Nanoengineers at the University of California San Diego have developed new deep learning models that can accurately predict the properties of molecules and crystals. By enabling almost instantaneous property predictions, these deep learning models provide researchers the means to rapidly scan the nearly-infinite universe of compounds to discover potentially transformative materials for various technological applications, such as high-energy-density Li-ion batteries, warm-white LEDs, and better photovoltaics. To construct their models, a team led by nanoengineering professor Shyue Ping Ong at the UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering used a new deep learning framework called graph networks, developed by Google DeepMind, the brains behind AlphaGo and AlphaZero. Graph networks have the potential to expand the capabilities of existing AI technology to perform complicated learning and reasoning tasks with limited experience and knowledge—something that humans are good at. For materials scientists like Ong, graph networks offer a natural way to represent bonding relationships between atoms in a molecule or crystal and enable computers to learn how these relationships relate to their chemical and physical properties. The new graph network-based models, which Ong’s team dubbed MatErials Graph Network (MEGNet) models, outperformed the state of the art in predicting 11 out of 13 properties for the 133,000 molecules in the QM9 data set."</em> <a href="https://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/engineers_use_graph_networks_to_accurately_predict_properties_of_molecules_and_crystals">[...]</a>

And while scientists have chipped away at their mysteries—from capturing the first image of one, to detecting the ripples in space-time they create when colliding—key parts of understanding black holes have escaped them. For example, Stephen Hawking suggested in 1974 that black holes actually emit a stream of warm radiation created by their extremely strong gravity; but of course, no one has been able to get close enough to a black hole to observe it. Physicist William Unruh later suggested that the same type of radiation would appear if you were moving at a high enough acceleration; Einstein’s theory of general relativity confirms the equivalence between the two types of radiation.

<p><em>"Physicists at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have harnessed the phenomenon of “quantum squeezing” to amplify and measure trillionths-of-a-meter motions of a lone trapped magnesium ion (electrically charged atom). Described in the June 21 issue of Science, NIST’s rapid, reversible squeezing method could enhance sensing of extremely weak electric fields in surface science applications, for example, or detect absorption of very slight amounts of light in devices such as atomic clocks. The technique could also speed up operations in a quantum computer. “By using squeezing, we can measure with greater sensitivity than could be achieved without quantum effects,” lead author Shaun Burd said. “We demonstrate one of the highest levels of quantum squeezing ever reported and use it to amplify small mechanical motions,” NIST physicist Daniel Slichter said. “We are 7.3 times more sensitive to these motions than would be possible without the use of this technique.” Although squeezing an orange might make a juicy mess, quantum squeezing is a very precise process, which moves measurement uncertainty from one place to another."</em> <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2019/06/nist-team-supersizes-quantum-squeezing-measure-ultrasmall-motion">[...]</a>

In a proof-of-concept paper, researchers from North Carolina State University detail a new approach for creating multi-junction solar cells using off-the-shelf components, resulting in lower cost, high-efficiency solar cells for use in multiple applications. Multi-junction, or stacked, solar cells are currently the most efficient cells on the market, converting up to 45% of the solar energy they absorb into electricity. The cells are constructed by stacking semiconductors with varying bandgaps on top of one another, thereby allowing the cell to absorb differing wavelengths of solar radiation. However, these cells are much more expensive to produce than less efficient thin solar films. “We want to create high efficiency solar cells at a reasonable cost,” says Salah Bedair, Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at NC State and lead author of the research."</em> <a href="https://news.ncsu.edu/2019/06/multi-junction-solar-cells-off-the-shelf/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Turn your Game Boy Advance into a Bluetooth Controller :) How to use it: After launching the rom the bluetooth module enters discoverable mode. This means you can pair to it from whatever device you are going to use it with (PC, phone, Android TV...). After pairing the program will start sending keys to the device. The device address is stored so next time you launch you just have to press A to automatically connect to that device. How it works: The gba contains the code for a GBA program that uses the link port to communicate with a HC-05 bluetooth module using UART (HC-05 flashed with RN-42 firmware, find how to do it in the links at the bottom). This rom is stored in a W25Q32 flash chip."</em> <a href="https://github.com/Shyri/gba-bt-hid">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Add a user interface to a D1 mini Add a user interface to a D1 mini DETAILS Often you need some kind of a user interface for your project — a display, a menu, maybe some icons, some numbers or some plot, etc. Sure, you can simply slap a display module on it, but then you still need some kind of input. If your display comes with a touchscreen and you are ready to handle the complexity in code, then great. Otherwise you need to add a bunch of buttons, a joystick, an encoder or some other way of selecting options. And since at that point you have ran out of GPIO pins on your D1 Mini, you also need some kind of GPIO expander. And then you have to put it in some box to attach the buttons to, and it all gets complicated quickly."</em> <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/165983-d1-mini-ui-shield">[...]</a>

In the fall of 2016, I built a 'Precious Plastic' open source plastic shredder, and started experimenting with what I could make with shredded waste plastic. I built the Precious Plastic extruder, but was frustrated at how difficult and time consuming it was to create anything actually functional or useful. So I began to modify the Precious Plastic design, putting it on a vertical axis and trying to make it light enough to fit on a CNC router gantry, and power it with a stepper motor so that it could be controlled using existing 3D printing software. After many iterations, I finally got it printing this Spring, and the results have been very promising! It can currently print low-resolution objects with a build area of 24" x 12" x 4", but those dimensions are limitations of my gantry, not the extruder itself."</em> <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/166064-trash-printer-recycled-plastic-3d-print-head">[...]</a>
