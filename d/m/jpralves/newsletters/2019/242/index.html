<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1813, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Andrews_(scientist)">Thomas Andrews</a>. Este  físico irlandês  demonstrou a continuidade dos estados gasoso e líquido, durante o qual, durante as mudanças entre os dois estados, as propriedades físicas não apresentam mudanças bruscas. Ele descobriu a temperatura crítica do dióxido de carbono (1861), acima da qual o gás não pode ser liquefeito apenas pela pressão. Ele escreveu: Ainda podemos viver para ver ... corpos como oxigénio e hidrogénio no líquido, talvez até no estado sólido. Ele mediu com precisão calores de neutralização, formação e reacção; e calor latente de evaporação. Andrews foi o primeiro a usar um "calorímetro de bomba" - um recipiente metálico forte e selado para medir o calor da combustão. Ele estudou o ozono e provou que é um alótropo - ou forma alterada - de oxigénio.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1852, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_A._Michelson">Albert A. Michelson</a>. Este físico alemão-americano mediu com precisão a velocidade da luz e recebeu o Prémio Nobel da Física de 1907 "pelos seus instrumentos ópticos de precisão e pelas investigações espectroscópicas e metrológicas" que ele realizou com eles. Ele projectou o interferômetro Michelson altamente preciso e o usou para estabelecer a velocidade da luz como uma constante fundamental. Com Edward Morley, ele também o usou na tentativa de medir a velocidade da Terra através do éter (1887). A experiência produziu resultados nulos que levaram Einstein à sua teoria da relatividade. Ele mediu a barra padrão em Paris como 1.553.163,5 comprimentos de onda da linha vermelha de cádmio (1892-3).</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1943, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_DeVries">William DeVries</a>. Este cirurgião cardíaco americano fez o primeiro implante humano de um coração artificial permanente, o Jarvik-7, num paciente cardíaco terminal, Barney Clark, 61 anos, a 2 de Dezembro de 1982, na Universidade de Utah, Salt Lake City. Ele sobreviveu durante 112 dias, mas nunca foi forte o suficiente para deixar o hospital. O dispositivo, inventado por Robert K. Jarvik, bombeava sangue através de tubos alimentados por um compressor externo. Foram feitas mais quatro tentativas de implantes permanentes, mas depois abandonadas, pois os problemas técnicos do Jarvik-7 continuavam sem solução. O segundo, e maior sobrevivente, foi William J. Schroeder, que recebeu um Jarvik-7 em 25 de Novembro de 1984 no Humana Hospital Audubon em Louisville, Kentucky. Ele viveu 620 dias, morrendo em Agosto de 1986 aos 54 anos.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou o Rover 2020 da NASA completou o seu primeiro teste. Uma avaliação preliminar das suas actividades a 17 de Dezembro, permitiu constatar que o veículo espacial validou todas as caixas necessárias enquanto se deslocava para frente e para trás e fazia piruetas numa sala limpa no Laboratório de Propulsão a Jato da NASA em Pasadena, Califórnia. A próxima vez que o veículo espacial Mars 2020 conduzir, estará a fazê-lo em solo marciano.</p>

<p>E nesta semana que passou foi também anunciada uma parceria entre a Apple, a Amazon, a Google e a Zigbee para formar um grupo de trabalho para desenvolver um padrão aberto para dispositivos domésticos inteligentes. A iniciativa designada por "Project Connected Home over IP" visa desenvolver um padrão aberto que aumentará a compatibilidade de produtos domésticos inteligentes em várias plataformas, com segurança e privacidade como princípios fundamentais do seu desenho. O novo padrão tornará mais simples para as equipas de desenvolvimento a construção de dispositivos compatíveis com serviços domésticos inteligentes e assistentes de voz, garantindo que os consumidores possam escolher facilmente produtos domésticos inteligentes que funcionem perfeitamente juntos.</p>

<p>Também esta semana a fundação Raspberry PI anunciou um novo marco de 30 milhões de Raspberry PI produzidos desde 2012. Considerando que o co-fundador da Raspberry Pi Foundation, Ebert Upton, tinha expectativas muito mais modestas desde o início, prevendo vendas de apenas 10.000 unidades trata-se de uma marca de relevo. O Raspberry Pi gerou toda uma indústria de placas e, enquanto alguns superam o Raspberry Pi em especificações, nenhum deles o desafia seriamente no preço. Além disso, o Raspberry Pi possui o maior ecossistema de placas de hardware e suporte de software do sector apenas comparado ao Arduino, ainda que noutro segmento.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. São apresentadas as revistas newelectronics de 10 de Dezembro, a MagPI nº89 e a Hackspace Magazine nº26 de Janeiro de 2020, é também apresentado o livro "The Essential Guide to Electronics in Shenzhen".</p>

<p>E esta é a ultima Newsletter antes do Natal e nesse sentido, em meu nome e em nome do altLab gostaria de desejar a todos votos de Boas Festas e de Feliz Natal.</p>

<p><em>"NASA's next Mars rover has passed its first driving test. A preliminary assessment of its activities on Dec. 17, 2019, found that the rover checked all the necessary boxes as it rolled forward and backward and pirouetted in a clean room at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. The next time the Mars 2020 rover drives, it will be rolling over Martian soil. "Mars 2020 has earned its driver's license," said Rich Rieber, the lead mobility systems engineer for Mars 2020. "The test unambiguously proved that the rover can operate under its own weight and demonstrated many of the autonomous-navigation functions for the first time. This is a major milestone for Mars 2020.""</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7563">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Apple joins Amazon, Google, Zigbee Alliance and board members, to form working group to develop an open standard for smart home devices. Apple is taking a major step in its approach to the smart home by joining a new industry effort, Project Connected Home over IP. This initiative aims to develop an open standard that will increase the compatibility of smart home products across multiple platforms, with security and privacy as fundamental design tenets. The new standard will make it even simpler for developers to build one device that is compatible with smart home services and voice assistants, while ensuring consumers can easily choose smart home products that seamlessly work together. To accelerate the development of the new universal standard, Apple is open-sourcing portions of its HomeKit Accessory Development Kit (ADK). HomeKit has grown to become the most extensive, powerful and secure smart home platform available on more than a billion iOS and iPadOS devices."</em> <a href="https://developer.apple.com/homekit/whats-new/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-now-weve-sold-30-million/">Raspberry Pi has now sold 30 million tiny single-board computers</a></h2>

<p><em>"Developers and makers around the world have snapped up 30 million units of the Raspberry Pi since the diminutive British-designed computer began selling in February 2012. Raspberry Pi Foundation co-founder Ebert Upton had far more modest expectations at the outset, predicting sales of just 10,000 units. But the $35 mini computer — which has grown through four generations and branched out to the smaller form factor Raspberry Pi Zero — has turned into a permanent fixture on the DIY tech scene. Oracle earlier this year hailed its cluster of 1,060 Raspberry Pi boards the 'world's largest' Pi supercomputer, sporting 4,240 cores. NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) also uses the boards for its Mars mission. Others have used it as the guts of a synthesizer, and to build everything from DIY tablets, smartphones, smart-home tech and private clouds."</em> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/raspberry-pi-now-weve-sold-30-million/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"We are pleased to announce the release of Mbed OS 5.15 today. One of our primary focus areas over the past three months has been updating the underlying compiler infrastructure that we support in order to benefit from the performance optimizations and language enhancements those compilers bring to the Mbed ecosystem. Further, work continues to improve our support for Python 3 and many of our basic tools have been updated to support this version. For Mbed itself, we have added support in a backward compatible way for “static pin map tables” to further reduce memory consumption in scenarios where runtime modification is not needed and not required. Tooling Update GCC Compiler 9 Support Earlier this year, in our 5.13 release, we updated two of the three compilers we supported, Arm Compiler 6 and IAR Embedded Workbench. In this release, we’ve updated our support for the GCC compiler, from version 6 to version 9."</em> <a href="https://os.mbed.com/blog/entry/Mbed-OS-515-released-today/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Astrophysicists are redrawing the textbook image of pulsars, the dense, whirling remains of exploded stars, thanks to NASA’s Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER), an X-ray telescope aboard the International Space Station. Using NICER data, scientists have obtained the first precise and dependable measurements of both a pulsar’s size and its mass, as well as the first-ever map of hot spots on its surface. The pulsar in question, J0030+0451 (J0030 for short), lies in an isolated region of space 1,100 light-years away in the constellation Pisces. While measuring the pulsar's heft and proportions, NICER revealed that the shapes and locations of million-degree “hot spots” on the pulsar’s surface are much stranger than generally thought. “From its perch on the space station, NICER is revolutionizing our understanding of pulsars,” said Paul Hertz, astrophysics division director at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “Pulsars were discovered more than 50 years ago as beacons of stars that have collapsed into dense cores, behaving unlike anything we see on Earth."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/nasa-s-nicer-delivers-best-ever-pulsar-measurements-1st-surface-map">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) has approved a proposal to develop a standard for safety considerations in automated vehicle (AV) decision-making and named Intel Senior Principal Engineer Jack Weast to lead the workgroup. Participation in the workgroup is open to companies across the AV industry, and Weast hopes for broad industry representation. Group members will hold their first meeting in 2020’s first quarter. “The forthcoming IEEE standard will provide a useful tool to answer the question of what it means for an AV to drive safely.” – Jack Weast, Intel senior principal engineer Why It Matters: Industry and regulators are struggling to agree on a method for evaluating the safety of AVs, although most people agree that standards are needed to establish regulatory thresholds for granting AVs their driver’s licenses. Multiple approaches are in development even though industry consensus is lacking. Meanwhile, technology development is not standing still and is nearly ready."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news/ieee-to-define-a-formal-model-for-safe-automated-vehicle-decision-making/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"NVIDIA today introduced NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Orin™, a highly advanced software-defined platform for autonomous vehicles and robots. The platform is powered by a new system-on-a-chip (SoC) called Orin, which consists of 17 billion transistors and is the result of four years of R&amp;D investment. The Orin SoC integrates NVIDIA’s next-generation GPU architecture and Arm Hercules CPU cores, as well as new deep learning and computer vision accelerators that, in aggregate, deliver 200 trillion operations per second—nearly 7x the performance of NVIDIA’s previous generation Xavier SoC. Orin is designed to handle the large number of applications and deep neural networks that run simultaneously in autonomous vehicles and robots, while achieving systematic safety standards such as ISO 26262 ASIL-D. Built as a software-defined platform, DRIVE AGX Orin is developed to enable architecturally compatible platforms that scale from a Level 2 to full self-driving Level 5 vehicle, enabling OEMs to develop large-scale and complex families of software products. Since both Orin and Xavier are programmable through open CUDA and TensorRT APIs and libraries, developers can leverage their investments across multiple product generations."</em> <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-introduces-drive-agx-orin-advanced-software-defined-platform-for-autonomous-machines">[...]</a>

This new research could help eliminate the need for heavy metals in battery production and transform the long-term sustainability of many elements of our energy infrastructure. As battery-powered alternatives for everything from vehicles to smart energy grids are explored, there remain significant concerns around the sustainability of available battery technologies. Many battery materials, including heavy metals such as nickel and cobalt, pose tremendous environmental and humanitarian risks. Cobalt in particular, which is largely available in central Africa, has come under fire for careless and exploitative extraction practices.1 Using three new and different proprietary materials, which have never before been recorded as being combined in a battery, our team at IBM Research has discovered a chemistry for a new battery which does not use heavy metals or other substances with sourcing concerns. The materials for this battery are able to be extracted from seawater, laying the groundwork for less invasive sourcing techniques than current material mining methods."</em> <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2019/12/heavy-metal-free-battery/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"New technique for observing reaction products offers insights into the chemical mechanisms that formed them. During a chemical reaction, the molecules involved in the reaction gain energy until they reach a “point of no return” known as a transition state. Until now, no one has glimpsed this state, as it lasts for only a few femtoseconds (quadrillionths of a second). However, chemists at MIT, Argonne National Laboratory, and several other institutions have now devised a technique that allows them to determine the structure of the transition state by detailed observation of the products that result from the reaction. “We’re looking at the consequences of the event, which have encoded in them the actual structure of the transition state,” says Robert Field, the Robert T. Haslam and Bradley Dewey Professor of Chemistry at MIT. “It’s an indirect measurement, but it’s among the most direct classes of measurement that have been possible.” Field and his colleagues used millimeter-wave spectroscopy, which can measure the rotational-vibrational energy of reaction product molecules, to determine the structure of the products of the breakdown of vinyl cyanide caused by ultraviolet light."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/chemists-transition-state-reaction-1216">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In a finding that could be useful in designing small aquatic robots, researchers have measured the forces that cause small objects to cluster together on the surface of a liquid — a phenomenon known as the “Cheerios effect.” There’s an interesting fluid dynamics phenomenon that happens every morning in millions of cereal bowls. When there are just a few bits of cereal left floating on top of the milk, they tend to cluster together in the middle or around the edges of the bowl, rather than dispersing across the surface. Now a team of Brown University researchers has developed a way to measure the forces involved in this type of clustering. It’s the first time, the researchers say, that these forces have been experimentally measured in objects at the millimeter/centimeter scale. And the implications of the work go far beyond cereal bowls — the results could be useful in guiding the self-assembly of micromachines or in designing microscale robots that operate in and around water. “There have been a lot of models describing this Cheerios effect, but it’s all been theoretical,” said Ian Ho, an undergraduate student at Brown and lead author of a paper describing the work."</em> <a href="https://www.brown.edu/news/2019-12-19/cheerios">[...]</a>

Nuclear power continues to expand globally, propelled, in part, by the fact that it produces few greenhouse gas emissions while providing steady power output. But along with that expansion comes an increased need for dealing with the large volumes of water used for cooling these plants, which becomes contaminated with radioactive isotopes that require special long-term disposal. Now, a method developed at MIT provides a way of substantially reducing the volume of contaminated water that needs to be disposed of, instead concentrating the contaminants and allowing the rest of the water to be recycled through the plant’s cooling system. The proposed system is described in the journal Environmental Science and Technology, in a paper by graduate student Mohammad Alkhadra, professor of chemical engineering Martin Bazant, and three others. The method makes use of a process called shock electrodialysis, which uses an electric field to generate a deionization shockwave in the water."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/remove-contaminants-nuclear-plant-wastewater-1219">[...]</a>

What would our lives be without this publication? It is difficult to imagine, as this treatise revolutionized our fundamental understanding of electric fields, magnetic fields, and light. The twenty original equations (nowadays elegantly reduced into four), their boundary conditions at interfaces, and the bulk electronic response functions (dielectric permittivity ε and magnetic permeability µ) are at the root of our ability to manipulate electromagnetic fields and light (see Table (here without external interface currents or charges)). Therefore, wondering what our life would be without Maxwell’s equations means to try to envision our life without most of current science, communications and technology. On large (macro) scales, bulk response functions and the classical boundary conditions are sufficient for describing the electromagnetic response of materials, but as we consider phenomena on smaller scales, nonclassical effects become important."</em> <a href="https://isn.mit.edu/cheers-maxwell%E2%80%99s-electromagnetism-extended-smaller-scales">[...]</a>

Using a divide-and-conquer approach that leverages the power of compressed sensing, computer scientists from Rice University and Amazon have shown they can slash the amount of time and computational resources it takes to train computers for product search and similar “extreme classification problems” like speech translation and answering general questions.

In tests on an Amazon search dataset that included some 70 million queries and more than 49 million products, Shrivastava, Medini and colleagues showed their approach of using “merged-average classifiers via hashing,” (MACH) required a fraction of the training resources of some state-of-the-art commercial systems. “Our training times are about 7-10 times faster, and our memory footprints are 2-4 times smaller than the best baseline performances of previously reported large-scale, distributed deep-learning systems,” said Shrivastava, an assistant professor of computer science at Rice."</em> <a href="https://news.rice.edu/2019/12/09/rice-amazon-report-breakthrough-in-distributed-deep-learning/">[...]</a>

Alpha wave is a brainwave that allows a person to feel good and this alpha wave stops when person is in stress. So this device will produce artificially alpha waves to make the person feel good, happy and out of stress. This alpha waves will last for fifteen minutes and after that itll stops producing alpha waves but the stress detection will be still on and if persons stress not reduced or his heart beat is still high then itll again starts producing alpha waves."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Automatic-Stress-Detector-and-Reducer-Device/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Control this robot car from anywhere in world using internet via Google Assistant or Webapp Story As soon as I started learning from Bolt IOT course, my interest in IOT started developing rapidly. One day while surfing youtube, I saw a video on arduino board. I decided to explore more in IOT field using arduino. From there I decided to make a robot car using arduino. Stage One: Project Idea I was sitting and thinking that how to make my car more cool. Here comes idea in my mind that what if I do something and we can control this car wirelessly."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/skumawatrenwal11/voice-controlled-wireless-robot-car-2f84f5">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The Circuit Playground Bluefruit has all kinds of features built in, including NeoPixels, an accelerometer, two buttons, alligator-clip-friendly pads and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). This project uses these features to create a wireless NeoPixel animation and color remote control using CircuitPython. CircuitPython is a version of Python designed to run on microcontrollers like the Circuit Playground Bluefruit. You'll need two Circuit Playground Bluefruit (CPB) boards, an alligator-clip NeoPixel strip or two, and two batteries. You'll connect the NeoPixel strip(s) to the NeoPixel Animator CPB, and use the other as the Remote Control. This guide will show you how to connect everything up, and load the software onto the CPBs."</em> <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/circuit-playground-bluefruit-neopixel-animation-and-color-remote-control?view=all">[...]</a>
