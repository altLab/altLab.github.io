<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1804, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Deere_(inventor)">John Deere</a>. Este norte-americano foi pioneiro na invenção e fabrico de equipamentos agrícolas. Como ferreiro numa cidade de pradarias nos EUA, ele fazia frequentemente reparações nos arados de madeira e ferro fundido do leste dos EUA porque os solos locais eram pesados e pegajosos. Em 1838, ele produziu mais três arados de aço adequados para o seu novo projecto, e mais nos anos seguintes, que se expandiram para o negócio de máquinas agrícolas que ele começou a mudar para Moline, Illinois (1847). Noutros dez anos, a sua produção anual aumentou dez vezes. Originalmente usando aço inglês importado em vez de ferro fundido, ele converteu-se ao aço produzido nos EUA quando as siderurgias de aço de Pittsburgh puderam fornecer um produto adequado. A empresa diversificou com a produção de grades, brocas, cultivadores e vagões.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1877, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._H._Hardy">G. H. Hardy</a>. Este matemático inglês ficou conhecido pelo seu trabalho na teoria dos números e análise matemática. Os interesses de Hardy cobriam muitos tópicos de matemática pura - análise diofantina, somatória de séries divergentes, séries de Fourier, a função zeta de Riemann e a distribuição de primos. Embora Hardy se considere um matemático puro, no início de sua carreira, ele ainda trabalhou em matemática aplicada quando formulou uma lei que descreve como proporções de características genéticas dominantes e recessivas se propagam em uma grande população (1908). Hardy considerou que não é importante, mas provou ser de grande importância na distribuição de grupos sanguíneos. Como também foi descoberto independentemente por Weinberg, e é conhecido como o princípio de Hardy-Weinberg.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1926, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantin_Feoktistov">Konstantin Feoktistov</a>. Este Cosmonauta e engenheiro espacial russo ficou conhecido por, a partir de 1955, fazer parte da equipa que projetou as naves espaciais Sputnik, Vostok, Voskhod e Soyuz sob a liderança de Sergey Korolev. Ele treinou como um cosmonauta, e finalmente foi lançado a 12 de Outubro de 1964 para 16 órbitas terrestres como um dos tripulantes de Voskhod 1 (com Vladimir M. Komarov e Boris B. Yegorov), o primeiro voo espacial multi-manto do mundo. Apenas dez pessoas estavam em órbita antes da missão Voskhod 1. Quando a sua carreira como cosmonauta terminou por razões médicas, ele continuou como engenheiro espacial tornando-se chefe do departamento de design espacial soviético que projetou as estações espaciais Salyut e Mir.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que o Norte magnético da Terra está a deslocar-se rapidamente do Ártico canadiano em direcção à Sibéria. Normalmente, uma versão nova e atualizada do World Magnetic Model (WMM) é lançada a cada cinco anos. Com o último lançamento em 2015, a próxima versão está prevista para lançamento no final de 2019. Devido a variações não planeadas na região do Ártico, os cientistas lançaram um novo modelo para representar com mais precisão a mudança do campo magnético entre 2015 e agora. Esta actualização fora de ciclo antes do lançamento oficial do WMM2020 no próximo ano garantirá navegação segura para aplicações militares, companhias aéreas comerciais, operações de busca e salvamento e outras que operam em torno do Polo Norte.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker.</p>

<p><em>"Earth’s northern magnetic pole is moving quickly away from the Canadian Arctic toward Siberia. This movement has forced NCEI’s scientists to update the World Magnetic Model (WMM) mid-cycle. Typically, a new and updated version of the WMM is released every five years. With the last release in 2015, the next version is scheduled for release at the end of 2019. Due to unplanned variations in the Arctic region, scientists have released a new model to more accurately represent the change of the magnetic field between 2015 and now. This out-of-cycle update before next year’s official release of WMM2020 will ensure safe navigation for military applications, commercial airlines, search and rescue operations, and others operating around the North Pole."</em> <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/world-magnetic-model-out-cycle-release">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The Hubble Space Telescope’s Wide Field Camera 3 is once again operational after issues earlier this month caused the camera to suddenly stop observations. On Jan. 8, the telescope’s camera abruptly stopped working when it detected voltage levels outside of the expected range. That set engineers searching for what caused the problem. After investigating the issue, the team ended up finding that the voltage levels inside the camera were actually normal. Instead, data in the instrument’s telemetry circuits wasn’t accurate. And all of the instrument’s other telemetry circuits also had bad data."</em> <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2019/01/28/hubble-observing-again-after-problem/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Quantum sensors being developed at The University of Queensland could revolutionise navigation and communications in unmanned and autonomous vehicles. UQ researchers are working with the Australian Defence Force (ADF), NASA, Orica Ltd and Brisbane’s Skyborne Technologies to develop the next-generation sensors as part of a $6.6 million Australian initiative to develop quantum technologies for use in defence applications. UQ scientist Professor Warwick Bowen said the research could position Australia as a world-leader in ultraprecise sensors for unmanned and autonomous vehicles. “This is an exciting new direction, applying quantum physics to major challenges in modern technology,” he said. “Quantum sensors allow greatly improved performance and could transform navigation and positioning capabilities for unmanned vehicles. “These sensors will be so precise that the laws of quantum physics are required to understand how they function."</em> <a href="https://www.uq.edu.au/news/node/123211">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A key ingredient in effective teams – whether athletic, business, or military – is trust, which is based in part on mutual understanding of team members’ competence to fulfill assigned roles. When it comes to forming effective teams of humans and autonomous systems, humans need timely and accurate insights about their machine partners’ skills, experience, and reliability to trust them in dynamic environments. At present, autonomous systems cannot provide real-time feedback when changing conditions such as weather or lighting cause their competency to fluctuate. The machines’ lack of awareness of their own competence and their inability to communicate it to their human partners reduces trust and undermines team effectiveness. To help transform machines from simple tools to trusted partners, DARPA today announced the Competency-Aware Machine Learning (CAML) program. CAML aims to develop machine learning systems that continuously assess their own performance in time-critical, dynamic situations and communicate that information to human team-members in an easily understood format."</em> <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2019-01-31">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In order to design noiseless electromagnetic (EM) devices, it is necessary to clarify the mechanism behind EM noise and theoretical calculations and computer simulations are performed for prediction assessment of devices. Two researchers at Osaka University developed an algorithm for numerical calculation of EM noise (interference) in electric circuits. EM noise is a problem that has proven to be difficult to solve. Caused by interference from transmission lines and connecting parts, various approaches have been taken to reduce it, such as adding filters and/or passive devices to circuits or using the symmetry of the configuration. The algorithm developed in this study is for computer simulation of electric circuits in which transmission lines are connected with lumped element models. Usually, the solution of problems along a transmission line is performed using partial differential equations, while the solution of problems in a lumped constant circuit uses ordinary differential equations."</em> <a href="https://resou.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/research/2019/20190130_2">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2019/01/31/new-3d-printer-uses-rays-of-light-to-shape-objects-transform-product-design/">New 3D printer uses rays of light to shape objects, transform product design</a></h2>

<p><em>"A new 3D printer uses light to transform gooey liquids into complex solid objects in only a matter of minutes. Nicknamed the “replicator” by the inventors — after the Star Trek device that can materialize any object on demand — the 3D printer can create objects that are smoother, more flexible and more complex than what is possible with traditional 3D printers. It can also encase an already existing object with new materials — for instance, adding a handle to a metal screwdriver shaft — which current printers struggle to do. The technology has the potential to transform how products from prosthetics to eyeglass lenses are designed and manufactured, the researchers say. “I think this is a route to being able to mass-customize objects even more, whether they are prosthetics or running shoes,” said Hayden Taylor, assistant professor of mechanical engineering at UC Berkeley and senior author of a paper describing the printer, which appears online today (Jan. 31) in the journal Science. “The fact that you could take a metallic component or something from another manufacturing process and add on customizable geometry, I think that may change the way products are designed,” Taylor said."</em> <a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2019/01/31/new-3d-printer-uses-rays-of-light-to-shape-objects-transform-product-design/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Engineers and researchers working under a project of the Russian Foundation for Advanced Research (FAR) — a government agency for defense research — has demonstrated the first Russian-made specialized neural network processor for energy efficient execution of machine learning algorithms based on deep neural networks. These algorithms are widely used to automatically solve tasks in image and speech recognition, self-driving car control, and elsewhere. The prime contractor of the project is the Neurocomputing Systems Lab of the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. Machine learning algorithms that rely on deep neural networks require considerable computing power, and they are typically run using graphics accelerators. The latter consume way too much power to be of use on a mobile platform, such as small unmanned aerial or ground vehicles or smart cameras. This is why researchers worldwide are pursuing the notion of specialized neural network tensor processors."</em> <a href="https://mipt.ru/english/news/first_russian_neural_net_processor">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/news/news/hybrid-electricity-system-would-reduce-rates-improve-service">Hybrid electricity system would reduce rates, improve service</a></h2>

<p><em>"A new distribution system designed by researchers at the University of Waterloo would reduce electricity prices by more than five per cent while also improving service reliability. The design involves the integration of the two kinds of electric current that power homes, industries and electric vehicles - alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC). Researchers found efficiencies by designing a system that delivers both kinds of current to customers instead of the AC-only distribution systems now in use throughout the world. Their approach minimizes conversions from one kind of current to the other and makes it easier to integrate growing green technologies. “Minimizing power conversion requirements creates a simpler system with greater efficiency and less loss,” said Haytham Ahmed, a postdoctoral fellow who led the research with electrical engineering colleagues at Waterloo. “As you reduce the number of converters, you also reduce the chances of service interruptions due to breakdowns.” Existing power networks carry AC because of the utilization of power transformers to increase voltage for greater long-distance transmission efficiency and reduce voltage for distribution purposes."</em> <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/news/news/hybrid-electricity-system-would-reduce-rates-improve-service">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A strategy inspired by the process responsible for muscle growth could lead to the development of stronger, longer-lasting materials. Hokkaido University researchers have developed a strategy to fabricate materials that become stronger in response to mechanical stress – mimicking skeletal muscle growth. Their findings, published in the journal Science, could pave the way for long-lasting materials that can adapt and strengthen based on surrounding conditions. The strategy was inspired by the process that makes human skeletal muscles become stronger. As a result of strength training at the gym, for example, muscle fibres break down, encouraging the formation of new, stronger fibres. For this to happen, the muscles must be supplied with amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, which join together and form muscle fibres."</em> <a href="https://www.global.hokudai.ac.jp/blog/self-growing-materials-that-strengthen-in-response-to-force/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2019/01/crinkles">Graphene crinkles can be used as 'molecular zippers'</a></h2>

<p><em>"New research shows that electrically charged crinkles in layered graphene can be useful in the directed self- assembly of molecules. PROVIDENCE, R.I. [Brown University] — A decade ago, scientists noticed something very strange happening when buckyballs — soccer ball shaped carbon molecules — were dumped onto a certain type of multilayer graphene, a flat carbon nanomaterial. Rather than rolling around randomly like marbles on a hardwood floor, the buckyballs spontaneously assembled into single-file chains that stretched across the graphene surface. Now, researchers from Brown University’s School of Engineering have explained how the phenomenon works, and that explanation could pave the way for a new type of controlled molecular self-assembly. In a paper published in Proceedings of the Royal Society A, the Brown team shows that tiny, electrically charged crinkles in graphene sheets can interact with molecules on the surface, arranging those molecules in electric fields along the paths of the crinkles. “What we show is that crinkles can be used to create ‘molecular zippers’ that can hold molecules onto a graphene surface in linear arrays,” said Kyung-Suk Kim, director of the Center for Advanced Materials Research in Brown’s Institute for Molecular and Nanoscale Innovation and the study’s senior author."</em> <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2019/01/crinkles">[...]</a>

<p><em>"HPC helps researchers understand experiments for observing real-time motion of lithium atoms in bi-layer graphene, paving the way for designing new materials for batteries and other electronics. Whether it is high-temperature superconductors and improved energy storage to bendable metals and fabrics capable of completely wicking liquids, materials scientists study and understand the physics of interacting atoms in solids to ultimately find ways to improve materials we use in every aspect of daily life. The frontier of materials science research lies not in alchemical trial and error, though; to better understand and improve materials today, researchers must be able to study material properties at the atomic scale and under extreme conditions. As a result, researchers have increasingly come to rely on simulations to complement or inform experiments into materials’ properties and behaviours. A team of researchers led by Dr. Arkady Krasheninnikov, physicist at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, partners with experimentalists to answer fundamental questions about materials’ properties, and the team recently had a big breakthrough—experimentalists were able to observe in real time lithium atoms’ behaviour when placed between two graphene sheets. A graphene sheet is what researchers consider a 2D material, as it is only one atom thick, which made it possible to observe lithium atom motion in a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments."</em> <a href="http://www.gauss-centre.eu/SharedDocs/Meldungen/GAUSS-CENTRE/EN/2019/news_02_2D_Materials_HZDR.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Mechanical systems, such as engines and motors, rely on two principal types of motions of stiff components: linear motion, which involves an object moving from one point to another in a straight line; and rotational motion, which involves an object rotating on an axis. Nature has developed far more sophisticated forms of movement — or actuation—that can perform complex functions more directly and with soft components. For example, our eyes can change focal point by simply contracting soft muscles to change the shape of the cornea. In contrast, cameras focus by moving solid lenses along a line, either manually or by an autofocus. But what if we could mimic shape changes and movements found in nature? Now, researchers at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) have developed a method to change the shape of a flat sheet of elastomer, using actuation that is fast, reversible, controllable by an applied voltage, and reconfigurable to different shapes."</em> <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2019/02/reconfigurable-soft-actuator">[...]</a>

It united electricity and magnetism, provided an ultimate description of electromagnetic waves, including light, and anticipated relativity and the field theories of the 20th century. More recently, more than 60 years ago, scientists found that electromagnetic radiation can not only propagate in free space but can also form surface waves at interfaces between different media, such as between metals and air or glass. This resulted in the development of plasmonics and metamaterials, where surface electromagnetic waves underpin a number of phenomena and useful applications. Another area of modern physics where surface waves play crucial role is topological quantum systems, which are very robust against small perturbations and continuous deformations. The discovery of nontrivial topological phases in condensed-matter quantum systems and the existence of topological surface modes at interfaces between topologically-different materials resulted in the Nobel Prize in physics in 2016."</em> <a href="http://www.riken.jp/en/pr/press/2019/20190204_1/">[...]</a>

But what if the reward for traversing such places was worth the risk? MIT engineers have now developed an algorithm that lets AUVs weigh the risks and potential rewards of exploring an unknown region. For instance, if a vehicle tasked with identifying underwater oil seeps approached a steep, rocky trench, the algorithm could assess the reward level (the probability that an oil seep exists near this trench), and the risk level (the probability of colliding with an obstacle), if it were to take a path through the trench."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/program-marine-robots-take-risks-0130">[...]</a>

Insect-scale flying robots are usually designed to mimic biological insects, because biological insects are masters of efficient small-scale flying.

Making a tiny robot with flapping wings that can move in all of the degrees of freedom necessary to keep it controllable is tricky, though, requiring complicated mechanical transmissions and complicated software as well. It’s understandable why the biomimetic approach is the favored one—insects have had a couple hundred million years to work out all the kinks, and the other ways in which we’ve figured out how to get robots to fly under their own power (namely, propeller-based systems) don’t scale down to small sizes very well.

<p><em>"Retro computing is very popular. It's interesting to experience what computing was like in the 80s when 8-bit processors were the standard and 64K of memory was generous. While you can get a taste of this by using an ATMega328 based board such at the venerable Arduino UNO or a Metro 328, but it's not quite the same as using a 6502 or a Z80. You can go all the way to the hardware level and get something like the RC2014 Z80 computer kit for the full experience, or you can stick with an emulator on your desktop machine. This guide takes you somewhere in-between. It looks at running a Z80 emulator on state of the art microcontroller hardware."</em> <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/z80-cpm-emulator-for-the-samd51-grand-central?view=all">[...]</a>

We participated in that contest (via our university, Polytech Sorbonne) and came up with the idea of hacking the platform to make a pothole detection vehicle, that can update a map with the positions of the potholes in real time. Here's the promotional video we made about it (there are subtitles in English): So how does it work? Its array of 6 infrared sensors mounted under the vehicle pointing downwards detect changes in distance between the vehicle and the road, thus detecting potholes. The system's accelerometer can also detect the potholes and abrupt shocks the vehicle experiences due to abnormal vertical variations."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/polytech-sorbonne-holebot/holebot-pothole-detector-a013ba">[...]</a>

My goal is to record parameters like: Temperature Humidity Air pressure Air quality (something to do with CO or CO2) I then hope to send (wirelessly) the data to a base station and log/display it on a simple website. To make things interesting I also aim to power the data gathering station from a large supercapacitor (~100F), and in keeping with my solar tradition the supercapacitor will be charged from a solar-cell. Just like with my last project I want this thing to last for a good 20-40years with minimal intervention, meaning I will also have to dive into the wonderful world of watchdogs as well as structure my code to handle glitches properly. With all that said here is what I have so far: MCU + Tx/Rx After a bit of research I decided to go with the Nordic Semiconductor nRF52832 as doing so will allow me to have an MCU + Tx/Rx capability all on the one chip. Also this chip supports Bluetooth 5 so is ideal for this low power &amp; data rate application: Sensors To cover temperature, humidity, &amp; air pressure I will be using the trusty Bosch BME280."</em> <a href="https://www.antalife.com/2019/01/update-solar-powered-weather-station.html">[...]</a>
