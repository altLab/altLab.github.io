<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1837, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wesley_Hyatt">John Wesley Hyatt</a>. Este inventor e fabricante norte-americano foi pioneiro na indústria de plásticos. Ele descobriu o processo para fazer celulóide. As suas outras invenções incluíam um sistema de purificação de água, uma fábrica de cana-de-açúcar, uma máquina para endireitar barras de aço, uma máquina de costura de vários pontos e um rolamento cónico amplamente utilizado. Na década de 1860, ele interessou-se em encontrar um substituto para o marfim usado para fazer bolas de bilhar. Com seu irmão Isaac, ele melhorou as técnicas de moldagem da piroxilina (uma celulose parcialmente nitrada) com cânfora, dissolvendo uma mistura de álcool e éter para torná-la mais macia e maleável. Ele chamou-a de "Celluloid", marca registada em 14 de Janeiro de 1873. Foi o primeiro plástico sintético, para o qual ele obteve uma patente em 1870.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1858, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hadfield">Robert Hadfield</a>. Este Metalurgista inglês  desenvolveu o aço de manganês, uma liga de excepcional durabilidade que é utilizada na construção de trilhos ferroviários e máquinas de trituração de rochas. Hadfield descobriu o aço manganês em 1882. Foi endurecido pela têmpera em água a uma temperatura de mil graus centígrados. O aço duro deveria ser usado na fabricação de rodas de eléctrico. Ele patenteou seu trabalho em 1883-4, mas continuou a realizar outras experiências antes de divulgar as suas descobertas em 1888, que foram apoiadas por uma tour de palestras. A primeira guerra mundial proporcionou novos mercados para o aço manganês: placas e chapas de blindagem, correias de tanques e capacetes de soldados.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1950, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Alan_Hulse">Russell Alan Hulse</a>. Este Físico norte-americano  partilhou o Prémio Nobel de Física em 1993 com seu ex-professor, o astrofísico Joseph H. Taylor Jr., pela descoberta conjunta do primeiro pulsar binário (1974). Este é um sistema astronómico de dois corpos celestes tão próximos que são separados apenas por várias vezes a distância entre a lua e a terra. As suas descobertas, relatadas pela primeira vez em 1978, constituem a primeira prova indirecta da existência das ondas gravitacionais previstas por Albert Einstein na sua teoria da relatividade.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou foi lançada a versão 5.4 do Kernel Linux. Esta é a ultima versão estável do Kernel este ano. Esta nova versão apresenta algumas grandes mudanças que afectarão (positivamente) os fabricantes e os utilizadores finais. De entre a várias novidades destacam-se o "Kernel Lockdown" - uma funcionalidade que pretende ainda mais a segurança do Linux “restringindo o acesso aos recursos do Kernel que podem permitir a execução arbitrária de código via código fornecido pelos processos do espaço de utilizador. Adicionalmente passa a estar disponível o suporte para exFAT que permitirá transferir ficheiros superiores a 4GB para dispositivos formatados neste formato. Outra área onde foram feitas muitas melhorias foi ao nível do driver da AMD Radeon melhorando substancialmente o desempenho da utilização desta placa. Adicionalmente foi acrescentado suporte para o SoC Qualcomm Snapdragon 855, para as novas GPUs da Intel, para o Intel Icelake Thunderbolt, para execução do Kernel em laptops Arm, para o VirtIO-FS, entre outros.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. É apresentado também o livro "Retro Gaming with Raspberry Pi".</p>

<p><em>"Linux Kernel 5.4 is the last major stable kernel release of the year 2019. This new release has some big changes that will (positively) impact both manufacturers and end-users. Linux Kernel 5.4 Release Features Even though there are some significant improvements, Linus Torvalds gave an overview of what’s in this update in the announcement post: What little there is here is mostly some networking updates (mix of network drivers and core networking), and some minor GPU driver updates. Other than that it’s a small collection of random other things all over. The appended shortlog is small enough that you might as well just scroll through it. In addition to this, he also mentioned the work for Linux Kernel 5.5: Not a lot happened this last week, which is just how I like it."</em> <a href="https://itsfoss.com/linux-kernel-5-4/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"We’re delighted to announce the release of webOS Open Source Edition (OSE) 2.1.0. The highlights of this release are as follows: - Change of the default logging system to journald - Japanese Virtual Keyboard support and iLib upgrade - Bug fix and improvements For more details on this release, see the release notes. Change of the default logging system to journald The default logging system has been changed from pmlogd to journald. That is, on webOS OSE 2.1.0 or higher, journald is enabled and pmlogd is disabled by default. journald lets you view data logged from various sources including syslog call, standard output and error (stdout/stderr), kernel message (kmsg), and other logging mechanisms, whereas pmlogd only provides messages logged via syslog call. Therefore, with journald, you can use more logging data to trace and debug your program."</em> <a href="https://www.webosose.org/blog/2019/11/20/webos-ose-2-1-0-release/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, is officially launching his plan to “fix” the internet. The World Wide Web Foundation, a non-profit campaign group set up by Berners-Lee, has secured the backing of tech giants Facebook, Google and Microsoft for the scheme, dubbed the “contract for the web.” The British computer scientist first outlined his vision to overhaul organizations’ approach to the internet at the Web Summit event last year. At the time, he said the web was “at a tipping point.” The contract calls on companies to respect consumers’ data privacy and urges governments to ensure everyone has access to the internet. “Never before has the web’s power for good been more under threat,” Adrian Lovett, CEO of the World Wide Web Foundation, told CNBC in an interview Friday. He added that the rise of hateful content and fake news being propagated online meant something had to change. “We’re launching the contract for the web for the world’s first-ever global action plan to protect the web as a force for good, bringing together companies, governments and citizens from around the world to say these are the things that need to be done to put things back on the right track.” Other organizations backing the contract include DuckDuckGo, Reddit, GitHub and Reporters Without Borders."</em> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/25/tim-berners-lee-launches-contract-for-the-web-to-fix-the-internet.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Most chips in today’s smartphones, computers and servers are comprised of multiple smaller chips invisibly sealed inside one rectangular package. How do these multiple chips — often including CPU, graphics, memory, IO and more — communicate? An Intel innovation called EMIB (embedded multi-die interconnect bridge) is a complex multi-layered sliver of silicon no bigger than a grain of rice. It lets chips fling enormous quantities of data back and forth among adjoining chips at blinding speeds: several gigabytes per second. Today, Intel EMIBs speed the flow of data inside nearly 1 million laptops and field programmable gate array devices worldwide.

<p><em>"Optimizing soft robots to perform specific tasks is a huge computational problem, but a new model can help. MIT researchers have invented a way to efficiently optimize the control and design of soft robots for target tasks, which has traditionally been a monumental undertaking in computation. Soft robots have springy, flexible, stretchy bodies that can essentially move an infinite number of ways at any given moment. Computationally, this represents a highly complex “state representation,” which describes how each part of the robot is moving. State representations for soft robots can have potentially millions of dimensions, making it difficult to calculate the optimal way to make a robot complete complex tasks. At the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems next month, the MIT researchers will present a model that learns a compact, or “low-dimensional,” yet detailed state representation, based on the underlying physics of the robot and its environment, among other factors."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/model-design-control-robots-target-1122">[...]</a>

Attempts to evade such censorship have turned into a continually escalating race to keep up with ever-changing, increasingly sophisticated internet censorship. Censoring regimes have had the advantage in that race, because researchers must manually search for ways to circumvent censorship, a process that takes considerable time. New work led by University of Maryland computer scientists could shift the balance of the censorship race. The researchers developed a tool called Geneva (short for Genetic Evasion), which automatically learns how to circumvent censorship. Tested in China, India and Kazakhstan, Geneva found dozens of ways to circumvent censorship by exploiting gaps in censors' logic and finding bugs that the researchers say would have been virtually impossible for humans to find manually."</em> <a href="https://research.umd.edu/news/news_story.php?id=12674">[...]</a>

In this type of electrolyzer cell the hydrogen ions migrate via a proton exchange membrane from the oxygen producing anode to the hydrogen producing cathode. The membrane-based technique offers many advantages.

The prototype scans the content in less than the 0.1 second that the eye takes to integrate different light stimuli under a single shape.

<p><em>"The rise in popularity of electric vehicles and aircraft presents the possibility of moving away from fossil fuels toward a more sustainable future. While significant technological advancements have dramatically increased the efficiency of these vehicles, there are still several issues standing in the way of widespread adoption. One of the most significant of these challenges has to do with mass, as even the most current electric vehicle batteries and supercapacitors are incredibly heavy. A research team from the Texas A&amp;M University College of Engineering is approaching the mass problem from a unique angle. Most of the research aimed at lowering the mass of electric vehicles has focused on increasing the energy density, thus reducing the weight of the battery or supercapacitor itself. However, a team led by Dr. Jodie Lutkenhaus, professor in the Artie McFerrin Department of Chemical Engineering, believes that lighter electric vehicles and aircraft can be achieved by storing energy within the structural body panels."</em> <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/news/2019/11/new-electrodes-could-increase-efficiency-of-electric-vehicles-and-aircraft.html">[...]</a>

Peter Baltus at Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands and his colleagues have developed golf ball-sized sensors that can collect information as they float through pipes. Each robot contains a microprocessor, sensor, memory boards and a battery. They can be programmed to detect sound, temperature, pressure, acceleration, rotation and magnetic fields. To save power, a sensor can be activated by a sudden change in conditions, such as hissing sounds associated with water escaping, or increased rotation, which could be a sign of turbulent water flow.

<p><em>"Researchers at the University of Waterloo have developed a method that could pave the way to establishing universal standards for measuring the performance of quantum computers. The new method, called cycle benchmarking, allows researchers to assess the potential of scalability and to compare one quantum platform against another. “This finding could go a long way toward establishing standards for performance and strengthen the effort to build a large-scale, practical quantum computer,” said Joel Wallman, an assistant professor at Waterloo’s Faculty of Mathematics and Institute for Quantum Computing. “A consistent method for characterizing and correcting the errors in quantum systems provides standardization for the way a quantum processor is assessed, allowing progress in different architectures to be fairly compared. Cycle benchmarking provides a solution that helps quantum computing users determine the comparative value of competing hardware platforms and increase the capability of each platform to deliver robust solutions for their applications of interest. The breakthrough comes as the quantum computing race is rapidly heating up, and the number of cloud quantum computing platforms and offerings is quickly expanding."</em> <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/news/news/researchers-reach-milestone-quantum-standardization">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Columbia researchers invent a new way to tune the properties of 2D materials by adjusting the twist angle between them; technology enables the development of nanoelectromechanical sensors with applications in astronomy, medicine, search and rescue, and more. A recent study from the labs of James Hone (mechanical engineering) and Cory Dean (physics) demonstrates a new way to tune the properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials simply by adjusting the twist angle between them. The researchers built devices consisting of monolayer graphene encapsulated between two crystals of boron nitride and, by adjusting the relative twist angle between the layers, they were able to create multiple moiré patterns. Moiré patterns are of high interest to condensed matter physicists and materials scientists who use them to change or generate new electronic material properties. These patterns can be formed by aligning boron nitride (BN, an insulator) and graphene (a semimetal) crystals. When these honeycomb lattices of atoms are close to alignment, they create a moiré superlattice, a nanoscale interference pattern that also looks like a honeycomb."</em> <a href="https://engineering.columbia.edu/press-releases/breaking-graphene-symmetry">[...]</a>

<p><em>"An international team led by researchers at Princeton University has directly observed a surprising quantum effect in a high-temperature iron-containing superconductor. Superconductors conduct electricity without resistance, making them valuable for long-distance electricity transmission and many other energy-saving applications. Conventional superconductors operate only at extremely low temperatures, but certain iron-based materials discovered roughly a decade ago can superconduct at relatively high temperatures and have drawn the attention of researchers. Exactly how superconductivity forms in iron-based materials is something of a mystery, especially since iron’s magnetism would seem to conflict with the emergence of superconductivity. A deeper understanding of unconventional materials such as iron-based superconductors could lead eventually to new applications for next-generation energy-saving technologies. The researchers probed the behavior of iron-based superconductors when impurities – namely atoms of cobalt – are added to explore how superconductivity forms and dissipates."</em> <a href="https://discovery.princeton.edu/2019/11/22/princeton-scientists-discover-surprising-quantum-effect-in-an-exotic-superconductor/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scientists from the universities of Alberta and Toronto developed a blueprint for a new quantum battery that doesn’t leak charge. “A quantum battery is a tiny, nano-size battery meant to be used for applications on the nano scale,” explained U of A chemist Gabriel Hanna, who was principal investigator on the study. He said the research provides a theoretical demonstration that creating a loss-free quantum battery is possible—offering an advantage over previously proposed quantum batteries. “The batteries that we are more familiar with—like the lithium-ion battery that powers your smartphone—rely on classical electrochemical principles, whereas quantum batteries rely solely on quantum mechanics,” Hanna noted. He said the batteries may become an important component in many quantum devices—able to power quantum computers, for example—and in practice, they could be built using current solid-state technologies. To realize their idea, the research team considered an open quantum network model with high structural symmetry as a platform for storing excitonic energy—energy harnessed when an electron absorbs a sufficiently energetic photon of light.Using this model, they showed it is possible to store energy without any loss, despite being open to an environment."</em> <a href="https://www.folio.ca/researchers-create-blueprint-for-quantum-battery-that-doesnt-lose-charge/">[...]</a>

A team led by physics professors Itai Cohen and Paul McEuen is using the binding power of magnets to design self-assembling systems that potentially can be created in nanoscale form. Their paper, “Magnetic Handshake Materials as A Scale-Invariant Platform for Programmed Self-Assembly,” published Nov. 21 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. To make small systems – such as miniature machines, gels and metamaterials – that essentially build themselves, the researchers took inspiration from DNA origami, in which atomic-scale DNA strands can be folded into two- and three-dimensional structures through a process called complementary base pairing, where specific nucleotides bind to one another: A to T and G to C. Rather than relying on atomic bonds, the team was drawn to another form of attraction: magnetics. Here, the attraction and repulsion between multiple magnets can serve as a kind of intelligent connection, like a handshake. Magnetic interactions also make for strong, versatile bonds that aren’t easily disrupted by thermal effects."</em> <a href="http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2019/11/self-assembling-system-uses-magnets-mimic-specific-binding-dna">[...]</a>

In computers, this memory is referred to as dynamic random-access memory, or DRAM. The speed of DRAM is very important and can have a significant impact in the overall speed of the system.

In a paper appearing this week in the journal Science, researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) and Rice University describe an experiment that turned 20 kilometers of undersea fiber-optic cable into the equivalent of 10,000 seismic stations along the ocean floor. During their four-day experiment in Monterey Bay, they recorded a 3.5 magnitude quake and seismic scattering from underwater fault zones. Their technique, which they had previously tested with fiber-optic cables on land, could provide much-needed data on quakes that occur under the sea, where few seismic stations exist, leaving 70% of Earth’s surface without earthquake detectors. “There is a huge need for seafloor seismology.

<p><em>"Thank GOD and all of you for make my project Baby-MIT-Cheetah-Robot won the first prize in the Contest Make it Move. I am very happy because lot of friends ask lot of question in conversation and in messages. One of the important question was how the robot move smoothly (with out body up and down) and asked about the array in the program initialization, how it is calculated. For the answer of that questions i plan to make a drawing bot with the legs i designed for the Baby-MIT-Cheetah-Robot. This is the test leg first i designed before print all the four legs. Also for this i try to draw in android and transfer the data to arduino to draw."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Mini-Drawing-Bot-Live-Android-App-Trignomentry/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In this post I’m going to write about my experiments with interfacing a low-cost serial GPS module directly to uLisp, to create projects such as a GPS clock: I’ll also describe a GPS speedometer and odometer, and a simple navigator, in later posts. The module I used is the GP-20U7, a small GPS module available for under $20 from SparkFun GPS Receiver - GP-20U7 (56 Channel) 3, but almost any other GPS module should be suitable. The GPS Clock and GPS Speedometer/Odometer will work on any version of uLisp, with sufficient memory, such as the Arduino Mega 2560. The simple navigator requires a 32-bit version of uLisp, running on a board such as the Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0. "</em> <a href="http://forum.ulisp.com/t/gps-interface-using-ulisp/450/1">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Everyone goes crazy for microcontrollers, but is there a way to channel my input signals into one bus? The answer is yes! Let's say we want to read 4 potentiometers (or variable resistors), and 3 buttons for some reason, and make those inputs light up a LED based on its value. We can do this by writing a few lines of code, setting 7 inputs, 4 of them analog and 3 digital ones, right? But as the title of the project, I want to use the CD4051 IC (integrated circuit) to channel the 7 inputs to output to only 1 pin! This is called multiplexing, and it's a very useful tool when trying to save on wiring, space, or efficiency."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/sherwinchiu89/multiplexing-8-different-analog-signals-into-one-8d80d9">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This is a three-reeled slot machine with 25 symbols on each reel. The game is configurable. This project is my implementation of an alien themed slot machine using two ATmega328P-PU micro-controllers. I was inspired by Cory Potter's Alien Invasion Slot Machine, and I wanted to expand on that idea. The slot machine is for entertainment and educational purposes only. I tried my best to make the game simulate a real slot machine as closely as possible."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/dan-murphy/atmega-alien-themed-slot-machine-07ab7d">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Previously we have made a few robots using Arduino and ESP boards. If you remember it takes a lot of components along side the microcontroller itself to make a robot. There are Motor Drivers, Servo Controllers and voltage regulators. To connect all these components we need breadboard or Perf board to solder everything together. This may take a considerable amount of time and makes a mess with wires. This makes it hard for people dbug the connections if something goes wrong."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Nano-Robot-Controller-How-to-Use-It/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The Arduino allows users to customize virtually anything they ever desire with a small amount of code. I decided to develop a Guitar Hero game with adjustable speed, volume, and multiple game modes. This project can also run off of 3 AA batteries so it can be portable. I hope you guys learn from this project and have fun customizing it! Let me know what you guys think!
