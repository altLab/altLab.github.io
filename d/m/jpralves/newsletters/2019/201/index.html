<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1839 - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Mond">Ludwig Mond</a>. Este Químico e industrial alemão-britânico aperfeiçoou um método de fabricação de soda melhorando o processo alcalino da Solvay. Mond desenvolveu um processo para a extracção de níquel quando, com os seus assistentes, descobriu acidentalmente compostos de carbonila de metal enquanto investigava por que as válvulas de níquel estavam corroídas pelo monóxido de carbono. Outras pesquisas levaram à síntese de mais carbonilos metálicos, que Lord Kelvin descreveu como "metais com asas" e ao processo de níquel-carbonila da Mond para refinar o níquel. O termo "célula de combustível" foi apelidado em 1889 por Ludwig Mond e Charles Langer, que tentaram construir o primeiro dispositivo prático para usar gás de carvão industrial e de ar, para gerar electricidade ao reagir hidrogénio com oxigénio.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1900, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_London">Fritz London</a>. Este Físico germano-americano, com Walter Heitler, inventou o primeiro tratamento mecânico quântico da molécula de hidrogénio, enquanto trabalhava com Erwin Schrödinger na Universidade de Zurique. Num artigo (1927), eles desenvolveram uma equação de onda para a molécula de hidrogénio com a qual foi possível calcular valores aproximados do potencial de ionização da molécula, calor de dissociação e outras constantes. Estes valores previstos foram razoavelmente consistentes com valores empíricos obtidos por meios espectroscópicos e químicos. Esta teoria da ligação química de moléculas homo-polares é considerada um dos avanços mais importantes da química moderna. A abordagem é mais tarde chamada de teoria da ligação de valência.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1917, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Holberton">Betty Holberton</a>. Esta engenheira informetica Norte-americana foi uma dos seis programadores originais do ENIAC, o primeiro computador digital electrónico de propósito geral, e foi a inventora dos "breakpoints" no "debug" de computadores. Programado o ENIAC para realizar cálculos para trajectórias balísticas electronicamente para o Laboratório de Pesquisa Balística (BRL). Ela ajudou a desenvolver o UNIVAC, projectando painéis de controle que colocam o teclado numérico ao lado do teclado e persuadindo os engenheiros a substituir o exterior preto do UNIVAC pelo tom cinza-bege que veio a ser a cor universal dos computadores. Holberton trabalhou com John Mauchly para desenvolver o conjunto de instruções C-10 para o BINAC, que é considerado o protótipo de todas as linguagens de programação modernas. Ela também participou do desenvolvimento de padrões iniciais para as linguagens de programação COBOL e FORTRAN com Grace Hopper. Mais tarde, como funcionária do National Bureau of Standards, ela foi muito activa nas duas primeiras revisões da Linguagem Fortran ("FORTRAN 77" e "Fortran 90").</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1930, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Miller">Stanley Miller</a>. Este Químico norte-americano fez uma série de experiências famosas, para determinar a possível origem da vida a partir de substâncias químicas inorgânicas na terra primitiva, recém-formada. Ele passou por descargas eléctricas (simulando trovoadas) através de misturas de gases redutores, como hidrogénio, amónia, metano e água, que se acredita terem formado a atmosfera mais antiga. Os dias de análise mostraram que os produtos químicos resultantes incluíam glicerina e alanina, os aminoácidos mais simples, os blocos de construção básicos das proteínas. Outros compostos incluíram ureia, aldeídos e ácidos carboxílicos. Assim, uma "sopa primitiva" é a explicação mais plausível actualmente aceita, embora incompleta, da origem das complexas moléculas orgânicas da vida.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou Linus Torvalds anunciou o primeiro Kernel Linux 5.0. O ciclo de desenvolvimento do Kernel Linux 5.0 começou à dois meses, durante os quais sete RC (Release Candidate) foram publicados para testar o caminho para esta grande mudança de versão. Embora a principal mudança de versão não tenha grande significado, o kernel do Linux 5.0 apresenta um conjunto interessante de novidades, como o suporte FreeSync no driver gráfico de código aberto AMDGPU para permitir uma experiência de visualização livre de falhas em máquinas com GPUs AMD Radeon e LCDs com taxas de actualização dinâmicas. Foi também introduzido um novo scheduler amigo da poupança energética que leva à gestão de energia melhorada em dispositivos que usam CPUs big.LITTLE ARM, suporte à criptografia do sistema de ficheiros Adiantum em fscrypt para dispositivos de baixa energia e suporte a ficheiros de swap no filesystem Btrfs. Outras alterações notáveis ​​incluem suporte para o recurso Generic Receive Offload (GRO) na implementação UDP (User Datagram Protocol), suporte para o controlador de recursos cpuset no cgroupv2, assim como suporte para o sistema de ficheiros binderfs que permite executar várias instâncias do Android.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que a Volvo irá testar um autocarro sem condutor em tamanho real em Singapura. A alta densidade de Singapura tem incentivando o desenvolvimento de tecnologias sem condutor na esperança de que seus habitantes usem mais veículos partilhados e transporte público. Testes com um autocarro no campus universitário podem começar dentro de algumas semanas ou meses, antes de se mudarem para vias públicas após aprovações regulamentares, disse o presidente da NTU, Subra Suresh, a repórteres.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. São apresentadas as revistas newelectronics de 25 e 26 de Fevereiro.</p>

<p><em>"The long-anticipated Linux 5.0 kernel series is now available for general public as Linus Torvalds put an end to the development cycle today, releasing the final version into the wild. The development cycle of the Linux 5.0 kernel series kicked off two months ago, during which seven RC (Release Candidate) milestones were published for testing paving the road for this major version change, which, sadly, doesn't mean anything besides the fact that running Linux 5.x is cooler than running Linux 4.x. "The overall changes for all of the 5.0 release are much bigger. But I'd like to point out (yet again) that we don't do feature-based releases, and that "5.0" doesn't mean anything more than that the 4.x numbers started getting big enough that I ran out of fingers and toes," said Linus Torvalds in a mailing list announcement. Here's what's new in Linux kernel 5.0 While the major version change doesn't mean a thing, the Linux 5.0 kernel does introduce some interesting bits, such as FreeSync support in the AMDGPU open-source graphics driver to allow for a stutter-free viewing experience on machines with AMD Radeon GPUs and LCDs with dynamic refresh rates. Linux kernel 5.0 also introduces a new energy-aware scheduling feature that leads to improved power management in devices using ARM big.LITTLE CPUs, support for the Adiantum file system encryption in fscrypt for low power devices, and support for swap files in the Btrfs file system."</em> <a href="https://news.softpedia.com/news/linux-kernel-5-0-officially-released-here-s-what-s-new-525159.shtml">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Sweden’s Volvo Buses and Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University (NTU) on Tuesday unveiled a full-size autonomous electric bus for testing this year in the city state. High-density Singapore has been encouraging the development of driverless technology in hopes that its residents will use more shared vehicles and public transport. Tests with one bus on the university campus could begin in a few weeks to months, before moving to public roads after regulatory approvals, NTU President Subra Suresh told reporters. He hoped the tests could be extended to public roads in a year. A second bus will undergo tests at a city bus depot. The 12-metre (39 ft) vehicle can carry up to 80 passengers and is the world’s first full-size, autonomous electric bus, Volvo and NTU said."</em> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-singapore-electric-bus/volvo-to-test-full-size-driverless-bus-in-singapore-idUSKCN1QM0IN">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Samsung's eMRAM will further strengthen the company’s technology leadership in embedded memory Samsung Electronics the world leader in semiconductor technology, today announced that it has commenced mass production of its first commercial embedded magnetic random access memory (eMRAM) product based on the company’s 28-nanometer(nm) fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator (FD-SOI) process technology, called 28FDS. As eFlash has faced scalability challenges due to a charge storage-based operation, eMRAM has been the most promising successor since its resistance-based operation allows strong scalability while also possessing outstanding technical characteristics of memory semiconductors such as nonvolatility, random access, and strong endurance. With today’s announcement, Samsung has proved its capability to overcome technical hurdles and demonstrated the possibility for further scalability of embedded memory technology to 28nm process node and beyond. Samsung’s 28FDS-based eMRAM solution offers unprecedented power and speed advantages with lower cost. Since eMRAM does not require an erase cycle before writing data, its writing speed is approximately a thousand times faster than eFlash. Also, eMRAM uses lower voltages than eFlash, and does not consume electric power when in power-off mode, resulting in great power efficiency."</em> <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-starts-commercial-shipment-of-emram-product-based-on-28nm-fd-soi-process">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The DFAB House is the world’s first home designed, planned, and built with mainly digital processes—and it's entirely powered by the sun. Step inside the newly completed DFAB House in Dübendorf, Switzerland, and you'll be whisked away to a world of science fiction. From the swirling grooves on the 3D-printed ceiling panels to the networked household appliances (like an intelligent teapot that can seemingly be brought to a boil by itself), this experimental building is a snapshot of what our future homes could be—digitally planned and built by giant robots. Developed by eight ETH Zurich professors in collaboration with planning professionals and industry experts, the DFAB House is a three-story residential unit perched atop Empa and Eawag’s NEST research and innovation building. The structure showcases an array of pioneering ETH-developed construction processes, including: Mesh Mould technology, in which an autonomous "In Situ Fabricator" robot builds a 3D mesh formwork for concrete load-bearing walls; Smart Slab, a lightweight concrete slab with 3D-printed sand formwork that’s less than half the weight of a conventional concrete slab; Smart Dynamic Casting, an automatic robotic slip-forming process; and Spatial Timber Assemblies, a digital prefabrication process that uses a dual robot system to create timber frame modules. Although robots and digital processes are the predominate building forces involved, people are still very much part of the construction process."</em> <a href="https://www.dwell.com/article/dfab-house-opens-in-switzerland-eth-zurich-6fe60aa6">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers at ETH Zurich have used trapped calcium ions to demonstrate a new method for making quantum computers immune to errors. To do so, they created a periodic oscillatory state of an ion that circumvents the usual limits to measurement accuracy. When building a quantum computer, one needs to reckon with errors – in both senses of the word. Quantum bits or “qubits”, which can take on the logical values 0 and 1 at the same time and thus carry out calculations faster, are extremely susceptible to perturbations. A possible remedy for this is quantum error correction, which means that each qubit is represented “redundantly” in several copies, such that errors can be detected and eventually corrected without disturbing the fragile quantum state of the qubit itself. Technically this is very demanding."</em> <a href="https://www.ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2019/02/immunising-quantum-computers-against-errors.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.wur.nl/en/newsarticle/3D-printed-nanomaterial-shows-different-transparencies-and-colours.htm">3D printed nanomaterial shows different transparencies and colours</a></h2>

<p><em>"This 21st-century invention was possible by synthesising special kinds of gold nanoparticles with different sizes. Those nanoparticles were then embedded in a common 3D printing material (PVA), available in any shop, and 3D printed with a standard off-the-shelf 3D printer. A bit of gold The amount of gold in the material is minute, a mere 0.07 weight percent.

It was also shown, that due to the same lattice structure (hexagonal) and small lattice mismatch (~1.5%) of graphene and hBN, graphene islands grow in the hBN with passivated edge states, thereby giving rise to the formation of defectless quantum dots embedded in the hBN monolayer."</em> <a href="https://iq.hse.ru/en/news/249800619.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scientists check whether information is lost or merely hidden inside a small quantum computer. Researchers at the Joint Quantum Institute have implemented an experimental test for quantum scrambling, a chaotic shuffling of the information stored among a collection of quantum particles. Their experiments on a group of seven atomic ions, reported in the March 7 issue of Nature, demonstrate a new way to distinguish between scrambling—which maintains the amount of information in a quantum system but mixes it up—and true information loss. The protocol may one day help verify the calculations of quantum computers, which harness the rules of quantum physics to process information in novel ways. “In terms of the difficulty of quantum algorithms that have been run, we’re toward the top of that list,” says Kevin Landsman, a graduate student at JQI and the lead author of the new paper. “This is a very complicated experiment to run, and it takes a very high level of control.” The research team, which includes JQI Fellow and UMD Distinguished University Professor Christopher Monroe and JQI Fellow Norbert Linke, performed their scrambling tests by carefully manipulating the quantum behavior of seven charged atomic ions using well-timed sequences of laser pulses."</em> <a href="https://jqi.umd.edu/news/ion-experiment-aces-quantum-scrambling-test">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This instructable creates a measurement instrument to help analyse RF 433MHz transmissions which are commonly used for low power remote communications in home automation and sensors. It could probably be easily modified to work 315MHz transmissions used in some countries. This would be by using the 315MHz version of the RXB6 instead of the current 433MHz one. The purpose of the instrument is two fold. First, it provides a signal strength meter (RSSI) which can be used to examine coverage around a property and find any black spots. Secondly it can capture clean data from transmitters to allow easier analysis of the data and protocols used by different devices."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/RF433Analyser/">[...]</a>

And if you dont know the M5Stack, watch this video: ESP32 M5Stack with DHT22. And todays example already has an SIM800L embedded in it. So with our assembly, it is possible to turn a lamp or fan on and off through an SMS message. And I can send this remotely, as there is no need for any application."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Automation-With-SIM800L-ESP32-M5Stack/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Hello Here is my another DIY project - simple and low budget remote controlled camera slider with 360 degree Horizontal Panning. This prototype remote slider works with linear forward, backward sliding, horizontal panning with speed control. The materials and parts used are easily available in the market, also basic tools I have used. The advantage of the slider is, the sliding distance can be increase/ decrease to desired distance and can set it up easily for shoot. I spent around Rupees 4000/- ($7) to complete this project.
