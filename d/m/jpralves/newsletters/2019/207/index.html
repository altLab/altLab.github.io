<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1838, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul-%C3%89mile_Lecoq_de_Boisbaudran">Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran</a>. Este químico francês desenvolveu métodos espectroscópicos aperfeiçoados que tinham sido desenvolvidos por Kirchhoff. Em 1859, ele começou a examinar minerais em busca de linhas espectrais desconhecidas. Quinze anos de persistência compensaram quando ele descobriu os elementos gálio (1875), samario (1880) e disprósio (1886). Ele acompanhado de Robert Bunsen, Gustav Kirchhoff e William Crookes classifica-se como um dos fundadores da ciência da espectroscopia. Guiado pela organização de linhas espectrais para elementos da mesma família, ele acreditava que o elemento que ele chamava de gálio (em homenagem à França) era o eka-alumínio previsto por Mendeleiev entre o alumínio e o índio. Uma vez que é líquido entre cerca de 30 - 1700C, um termómetro de quartzo de gálio pode medir altas temperaturas.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1863, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Longbourne_Callendar">Hugh Longbourne Callendar</a>. Este Físico inglês ficou famoso pelo trabalho em calorimetria, termometria e, principalmente, as propriedades termodinâmicas do vapor. Ele publicou as primeiras tabelas de vapor (1915). Em 1886, ele inventou o termómetro de resistência de platina usando a resistividade eléctrica da platina, permitindo a medição precisa de temperaturas. Ele também inventou o calorímetro de fluxo contínuo eléctrico, o termómetro de ar compensado (1891), uma balança de rádio (1910) e um termómetro de rolamento (1897) que permitiram a obtenção de dados de temperatura climática de longa duração. O seu filho, Guy S. Callendar, relacionou a mudança climática com o aumento do dióxido de carbono (CO2) resultante da queima de combustíveis de carbono (1938), conhecido como efeito Callendar, parte do efeito de estufa.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1882, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Edgar_Lilienfeld">Julius Edgar Lilienfeld</a>. Este físico e engenheiro electrónico americano-austro-húngaro, foi o inventor original do transístor de efeito de campo (FET) (1925) e do condensador electrolítico (1931).</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1911, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Goldhaber">Maurice Goldhaber</a>. Este Físico austro-americano inventou uma experiência para mostrar que os neutrinos sempre giram numa direcção (somente no sentido contra os ponteiros do relógio). O seu método era simples, elegante e usava um aparelho pequeno o suficiente para caber numa bancada, em vez de usar um enorme acelerador. Ele também descobriu que o núcleo do átomo de deutério consiste num protão e um neutrão.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a conhecer uma nova forma de fazer contas de multiplicar. Ao dividir números grandes em números menores, os investigadores reescreveram um limite matemático fundamental de velocidade. O método aprendido na escola primária ou o método de "transporte" exige cerca de n^2 etapas, em que n é o número de dígitos de cada um dos números que se está a multiplicar. Portanto, números de três dígitos exigem nove multiplicações, enquanto números de 100 dígitos exigem 10.000 multiplicações.
Outros métodos foram entretanto desenvolvidos dos quais se destacam o do matemático russo Anatoly Karatsuba que envolve a separação de um número e a recombinação de um novo modo que permite substituir um pequeno número de adições e subtracções por um grande número de multiplicações. O método economiza tempo porque a adição leva apenas 2*n etapas, ao contrário das etapas n^2. Posteriormente outros métodos foram apresentados por Arnold Schönhage e Volker Strassen que publicaram um método capaz de multiplicar grandes números em passos multiplicativos n x log n x log (log n), onde log n é o logaritmo de n.
O método de Schönhage e Strassen, que é como os computadores multiplicam grandes números, teve outras duas importantes consequências a longo prazo. Primeiro, introduziu o uso de uma técnica do campo de processamento de sinal chamado de Fast Fourier Transformation. A técnica tem sido a base para todos os algoritmos de multiplicação rápida desde então.</p>

<p>Esta semana que passou ficámos também a saber que a maior aeronave do mundo voa pela primeira vez o seu voo de teste sobre o Deserto de Mojave. O avião Stratolaunch com um desenho de fuselagem dupla e envergadura maior do que o comprimento de um campo de futebol americano, levantou voo a 0658 PDT do Mojave Air &amp; Space Port. Alcançando uma velocidade máxima de 189 milhas por hora, o avião voou por 2,5 horas sobre o Deserto de Mojave a altitudes de até 17.000 pés. Como parte do voo inicial, os pilotos avaliaram o desempenho da aeronave e as qualidades de manuseio antes de pousar com sucesso no Mojave Air and Space Port. A aeronave Stratolaunch é uma plataforma de lançamento móvel que permitirá acesso ao espaço aéreo de forma conveniente, acessível e rotineira. A ala central reforçada pode suportar vários veículos de lançamento, que podem pesar até um total de 225 toneladas.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como um modelo 3D que poderá ser útil. É apresentada a revista Hackpace nº 18 e o livro "An Introduction to C &amp; GUI Programming".</p>

<p><em>"By chopping up large numbers into smaller ones, researchers have rewritten a fundamental mathematical speed limit. Four thousand years ago, the Babylonians invented multiplication. Last month, mathematicians perfected it. On March 18, two researchers described the fastest method ever discovered for multiplying two very large numbers. The paper marks the culmination of a long-running search to find the most efficient procedure for performing one of the most basic operations in math. “Everybody thinks basically that the method you learn in school is the best one, but in fact it’s an active area of research,” said Joris van der Hoeven, a mathematician at the French National Center for Scientific Research and one of the co-authors."</em> <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematicians-discover-the-perfect-way-to-multiply-20190411/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"World’s largest aircraft takes to the sky for its test flight over Mojave Desert Stratolaunch Systems Corporation, founded by Paul G. Allen, today successfully completed the first flight of the world’s largest all-composite aircraft, the Stratolaunch. With a dual fuselage design and wingspan greater than the length of an American football field, the Stratolaunch aircraft took flight at 0658 PDT from the Mojave Air &amp; Space Port. Achieving a maximum speed of 189 miles per hour, the plane flew for 2.5 hours over the Mojave Desert at altitudes up to 17,000 feet. As part of the initial flight, the pilots evaluated aircraft performance and handling qualities before landing successfully back at the Mojave Air and Space Port. “What a fantastic first flight,” said Jean Floyd, CEO of Stratolaunch. “Today’s flight furthers our mission to provide a flexible alternative to ground launched systems."</em> <a href="https://www.stratolaunch.com/2019/04/13/stratolaunch-completes-historic-first-flight-of-aircraft/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"It landed on its drone ship, but the ocean was too rough to keep it there SpaceX successfully landed the center core of its Falcon Heavy rocket on a drone ship last week, but the vehicle accidentally fell into the ocean while in transit to the Florida coast. The company blamed the loss on choppy seas. “Over the weekend, due to rough sea conditions, SpaceX’s recovery team was unable to secure the center core booster for its return trip to Port Canaveral,” SpaceX said in a statement to The Verge. “As conditions worsened with eight to ten foot swells, the booster began to shift and ultimately was unable to remain upright. While we had hoped to bring the booster back intact, the safety of our team always takes precedence. We do not expect future missions to be impacted.” The center core is a modified Falcon 9 booster — one of three that make up the Falcon Heavy rocket."</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/15/18311945/spacex-falcon-heavy-center-core-drone-ship-rough-ocean">[...]</a>

An internet milestone known as "768k Day" is getting closer and some network administrators are shaking in their boots fearing downtime caused by outdated network equipment. The fear is justified, and many companies have taken precautions to update old routers, but some cascading failures are still predicted. WHAT IS 768K DAY? The term 768k Day comes from the original mother of all internet outages known as 512k Day. 512k Day happened on August 12, 2014, when hundreds of ISPs from all over the world went down, causing billions of dollars in damages due to lost trade and fees, from a lack of internet connectivity or packet loss."</em> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/some-internet-outages-predicted-for-the-coming-month-as-768k-day-approaches/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Samsung Electronics makes major strides in EUV-based advanced nodes, including 7nm mass production and 6nm customer tape-out Samsung Electronics, a world leader in advanced semiconductor technology, today announced that its 5-nanometer (nm) FinFET process technology is complete in its development and now is ready for customers’ samples. By adding another cutting-edge node to its extreme ultraviolet (EUV)-based process offerings, Samsung is proving once again its leadership in the advanced foundry market. Compared to 7nm, Samsung’s 5nm FinFET process technology provides up to a 25 percent increase in logic area efficiency with 20 percent lower power consumption or 10 percent higher performance as a result of process improvement to enable us to have more innovative standard cell architecture. In addition to power performance area (PPA) improvements from 7nm to 5nm, customers can fully leverage Samsung’s highly sophisticated EUV technology. Like its predecessor, 5nm uses EUV lithography in metal layer patterning and reduces mask layers while providing better fidelity. Another key benefit of 5nm is that we can reuse all the 7nm intellectual property (IP) to 5nm."</em> <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-successfully-completes-5nm-euv-development-to-allow-greater-area-scaling-and-ultra-low-power-benefits">[...]</a>

Insights into how droplets merge could help make 3D printing technologies more accurate and may help improve the forecasting of thunderstorms and other weather events, the study suggests. A team of researchers from the Universities of Warwick and Edinburgh ran molecular simulations on a supercomputer to analyse interactions between tiny ripples that form on the surface of droplets. These ripples – known as thermal-capillary waves – are too small to be detected by the naked eye or by using the most advanced experimental techniques. Researchers found that these tiny waves cross the gap between nearby droplets and make the first contact between them.

<p><em>"This project aims to solve a real problem of air quality analysis, applicable both in internal and external environments. The primary purpose of a systematic air quality monitoring network is to distinguish between areas where pollutant levels violate an ambient air quality standard and areas where they do not. As health-based ambient air quality standards are set at levels of pollutant concentrations that result in adverse impacts on human health, evidence of levels exceeding an ambient air quality standard in an area requires a public air quality agency to mitigate the corresponding pollutant. In other words, strategies, technologies, and regulations need to be developed to achieve the necessary reduction in pollution. The secondary purpose of a systematic monitoring network is to document the success of this sophisticated endeavor, either to record the rate of progress towards attaining the ambient air quality standard or to show that the standard has been achieved.

The stroboscopic effect, pioneered by Harold Edgerton, makes objects appear as though they are moving in slow motion. How does this work? A strobe light is flashed at the same rate and time as an object is moving. Every time the strobe light flashes, it illuminates the object in the object in the position that it is in. In the case of the fountain, the strobe light flashes every time the water droplets are in the same position relative to the lights, so it looks as though the water droplets aren’t moving when they are actually getting replaced by the water droplet after it each time the strobe light flashes, you just can’t see it."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Stroboscopic-Fountain/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Hey Its Soumojit Back again with a cool project. Its a ultimate paper piano with just arduino. Can be a good weekend project or can be a great thing in a science exhibition too. So the whole things work on concept of capacitive touch, you can read more about it here https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/CapacitiveSensor/. I also dont have too much knowledge about piano but I did a little research in internet and learn some stuff about piano and notes. So, in this piano their is 2 octaves and another c note, total 15 keys."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Ultimate-Arduino-Paper-Piano/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This Instructable describes how we can use the Node MCU board to collect data from multiple sensors, send this data to a hosted PHP file which then adds the data to a MySQL database. The data can then be viewed online as a graph, using chart.js. A basic knowledge of PHP and MySQL will be required for this project and you will need access to web hosting with these set up to be able to create and view your own graphs. I'm also assuming you have basic knowledge of using the Node MCU board and uploading sketches to it. (I use the Arduino IDE for this) As the Node MCU has only one analogue pin we will use multiplexing to be able to read data from multiple sensors. (A number of instructables cover this concept in more detail so I won't go into that here)."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Log-Data-and-Plot-a-Graph-Online-Using-NodeMCU-MyS/">[...]</a>

It would be nice to have a metronome device with the following functions to use it at home or at the music school conveniently. Compact form factor to fit small places on top or next to musical instruments, Battery operated, robust and portable to carry around, Easily set up even for kids, BPM value always displayed, Adjustable beats per minute with a Rotary knob, up to 240 BPM Audible tact with volume control, Silent mode for overnight headphone practice, Visual feedback of beats (1/4, 2/4, 3/3, 4/4, 6/8, etc.)"</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Metronome/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Wireless communication has become a key feature in our projects nowadays and talking about wireless, the first thing that comes to my mind is Wi-Fi or BT, but handling the Wi-Fi or BT communication protocols is not an easy task and consumes a lot of MCU resources, leaving small space for coding my application. Therefore, I usually opt for an external Wi-Fi/BT module serially connected to the microcontroller in order to split the roles and gain higher freedom. However, sometimes Wi-Fi and BT are overkill for some applications requiring low bitrate and short communication distance. Furthermore, using Wi-Fi or BT implies the necessity of connecting your Smartphone or device with proper authentication. Imagine that you simply need to turn on/off an external light, or change the lamp light intensity, or open an electric gate. Would it be worth to use Wi-Fi or BT?"</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Serial-Over-IR/">[...]</a>

For a while now, I have been satisfying my thirst and taste-buds with pre-made concentrates from sodastream. The unit allows you to easily carbonate water and add flavoring to it. However, where it exceeds in easy of use, it lacks in quality. After nearly 4 months of research and planning, I can finally say that i have built my own solution that goes above and beyond anything currently on the market. Having gone through all the steps, this project is great for those who want to build a full-tier product, involving both software and hardware."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Automated-Cocktail-Drink-Machine/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The 6502 has been around for just about 40 years, yet still powers the hearts of many electrical systems in place today, such as many microcontrollers and embedded systems. In fact, WDC still manufactures the 6502 and 65xx series chips under the 65c02 and 65cxx. I've noticed that WDC also introduced more package variants of the 6502 and 6522, such as PLCC and QFP. Another thing I noticed was the fact that these form factors of the 65c02 are almost never used. Given that the only people buying these are hobbyists, that isn't too suprizing, as they dont offer much over the standard 40 pin DIP.What they do offer, however, is small package size. I went off to try and design the smallest 6502 SBC i could, and was pleasantly suprized with the results."</em> <a href="http://notartyoms-box.net/6502watch.html">[...]</a>

As we began to build the mechanisms, we struggled to manage multiple complex components that needed to be assembled together. If only someone could give us a hand... That's why we, three Irvington High School students in Ms.Berbawy's class, decided to design and build a robotic hand from scratch! With a financial estimate of $150 for this S.I.D.E. Project, we were able to acquire all the materials needed while remaining well under the budget. The finished product consists of an Arduino Mega, a servo micro-controller that drives 5 servos, each of which is connected to a 3D printed finger that is able to move individually with realistic joints."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/High-Five-a-Robotic-Hand/">[...]</a>
