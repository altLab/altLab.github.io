<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1798, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Georg_Christian_von_Staudt">Karl Georg Christian von Staudt</a>. Este matemático alemão desenvolveu a primeira teoria completa de pontos imaginários, linhas e planos na geometria projectiva. O seu trabalho inicial foi determinar a órbita de um cometa e, com base nesse trabalho, ele recebeu o seu doutoramento. Ele mostrou como construir um polígono regular de 17 lados usando apenas compassos. Ele voltou-se para a geometria projectiva e os números de Bernoulli (descobertos por Jacob Bernoulli). Um trabalho importante em geometria projectiva, Geometrie der Lage foi publicado em 1847. Foi o primeiro trabalho a libertar completamente a geometria projectiva de qualquer base métrica. Ele também deu uma solução geométrica para equações quadráticas.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1872, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_Travers">Morris Travers</a>. Este químico inglês, enquanto trabalhava com Sir William Ramsay em Londres, descobriu o elemento krypton (30 de maio de 1898). O nome deriva da palavra grega para “oculto”. Era uma fracção separada do ar liquefeito, que quando colocado num tubo de Plücker ligado a uma bobina de indução produzia um espectro com uma linha amarela brilhante com um tom mais verde que a linha de hélio conhecida e uma linha verde brilhante que correspondia a nada visto antes.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1882, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_D._Babcock">Harold D. Babcock</a>. Este Astrónomo norte-americano conjuntamente com o seu filho, Horace, inventou o magnetógrafo solar (1951), para observação detalhada do campo magnético do Sol. Com o seu magnetógrafo, os Babcocks mediram a distribuição de campos magnéticos sobre a superfície solar a uma precisão sem precedentes e descobriram estrelas magneticamente variáveis. Em 1959, Harold Babcock anunciou que o Sol inverte a sua polaridade magnética periodicamente. Os estudos laboratoriais precisos de Babcock sobre espectros atômicos permitiram que outros identificassem as primeiras linhas "proibidas" em laboratório e descobrissem os raros isótopos de oxigénio. Com C.E. St. John, ele melhorou muito a precisão dos comprimentos de onda de cerca de 22.000 linhas no espectro solar, referindo-os a padrões recém-determinados.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1902 - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Morgenstern">Oskar Morgenstern</a>. Este economista e matemático germano-americano popularizou a “teoria dos jogos”, que analisa matematicamente o comportamento do homem ou dos animais em termos de estratégias para maximizar os ganhos e minimizar as perdas. Ele é co-autor de Teoria dos Jogos e Comportamento Económico (1944), com John von Neumann, que estendeu a teoria de jogos de estratégia de Neumann de 1928 para situações de negócios competitivas. Eles sugeriram que, muitas vezes, numa situação de negócios (“jogo”), o resultado depende de várias partes (“jogadores”), cada uma estimando o que todas as outras farão antes de determinar sua própria estratégia. Morgenstern foi professor na Universidade de Viena, na Áustria, de 1931 até a ocupação nazista em 1938), quando fugiu para os Estados Unidos e se juntou ao corpo docente da Universidade de Princeton. As suas publicações posteriores incluíram trabalhos sobre previsão económica e aspectos da defesa dos EUA.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1931, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_H%C3%B6rmander">Lars Hörmander</a>. Este matemático sueco recebeu a Medalha Fields em 1962 pelo seu trabalho em equações diferenciais parciais. Passando cinco anos por escrito, ele produziu um texto "A análise de operadores diferenciais parciais lineares", em quatro volumes (1983-85). Entre 1987 e 1990, ele foi vice-presidente da União Matemática Internacional. Em 1988, Hörmander recebeu o Prémio Wolf. O texto de Hörmander, "Uma Introdução à Análise Complexa em Diversas Variáveis", tornou-se um clássico que lida com a teoria das funções de diversas variáveis complexas.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1947, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michio_Kaku">Michio Kaku</a>. E um físico teórico norte-americano, futurista e divulgador da ciência (comunicador científico). Ele é professor de física teórica no City College de Nova York e no CUNY Graduate Center. Kaku escreveu vários livros sobre física e assuntos relacionados, esteve presente em programas de rádio, televisão e cinema, e escreve blogs e artigos online.</p>

<p>Faz hoje 15 anos que o Rover Opportunity da NASA se encontra na superfície de Marte. O Rover pousou numa região do Planeta Vermelho chamada Meridiani Planum em 24 de Janeiro de 2004, enviando seu primeiro sinal de volta à Terra por volta das 9h05 da tarde. PST (25 de Janeiro de 2004, às 12h05 EST). O rover do tamanho de um carro de golfe foi projectado para viajar 1.006 metros e operar no Planeta Vermelho por 90 dias (sois) de Marte. Ele viajou mais de 45 km e registou seu 5.000º dia (ou sol) de Marte em Fevereiro de 2018.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou a Boeing anunciou que o seu Veículo Aéreo de Passageiros Autónomo completou o Primeiro Voo. O protótipo do PAV completou uma descolagem controlada, pairando e pousando durante o voo, que testou as funções autónomas e os sistemas de controle de solo do veículo. Os voos futuros testarão o voo directo com asas, bem como a fase de transição entre os modos vertical e de voo directo. Esta fase de transição é tipicamente o desafio de engenharia mais significativo para qualquer aeronave VTOL de alta velocidade.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como um modelo 3D que poderá ser útil. São apresentadas as revistas HackSpace magazine #15, a Hello World issue 7 e a micro:mag issue 3.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7317">NASA's Opportunity Rover Logs 15 Years on Mars</a></h2>

<p><em>"NASA's Opportunity rover begins its 16th year on the surface of Mars today. The rover landed in a region of the Red Planet called Meridiani Planum on Jan. 24, 2004, sending its first signal back to Earth from the surface at 9:05 p.m. PST (Jan. 25, 2004, at 12:05 a.m. EST). The golf-cart-sized rover was designed to travel 1,100 yards (1,006 meters) and operate on the Red Planet for 90 Martian days (sols). It has traveled over 28 miles (45 kilometers) and logged its 5,000th Martian day (or sol) back in February of 2018. "Fifteen years on the surface of Mars is testament not only to a magnificent machine of exploration but the dedicated and talented team behind it that has allowed us to expand our discovery space of the Red Planet," said John Callas, project manager for Opportunity at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. "However, this anniversary cannot help but be a little bittersweet as at present we don't know the rover's status."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7317">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Boeing NeXt program tests prototype to advance safety and technology of urban air mobility Electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicle has design range of up to 50 miles Boeing [NYSE: BA] yesterday successfully completed the first test flight of its autonomous passenger air vehicle (PAV) prototype in Manassas, Virginia. Boeing NeXt, which leads the company's urban air mobility efforts, utilized Boeing subsidiary Aurora Flight Sciences to design and develop the electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft and will continue testing to advance the safety and reliability of on-demand autonomous air transportation. The PAV prototype completed a controlled takeoff, hover and landing during the flight, which tested the vehicle's autonomous functions and ground control systems. Future flights will test forward, wing-borne flight, as well as the transition phase between vertical and forward-flight modes. This transition phase is typically the most significant engineering challenge for any high-speed VTOL aircraft. "In one year, we have progressed from a conceptual design to a flying prototype," said Boeing Chief Technology Officer Greg Hyslop."</em> <a href="https://boeing.mediaroom.com/2019-01-23-Boeing-Autonomous-Passenger-Air-Vehicle-Completes-First-Flight">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The Arduino Science Kit Physics Lab, developed in collaboration with Google, is the first official Arduino kit designed for middle school curriculum. The Arduino Science Kit Physics Lab provides middle schoolers (ages 11 to 14) with a hands-on experience, enabling them to explore forces, motion, and conductivity with their classmates. Students can make their own hypothesis like a real scientist, then check their assumptions, and log data thanks to Google’s Science Journal app — a digital notebook for conducting and documenting science experiments using the unique capabilities of their own devices. The kit, based on the MKR WiFi 1010, includes a range of sensors to measure light, temperature, motion, and magnetic fields, as well as a set of props and full access to online course content for teachers and students to conduct nine exciting science projects inspired by popular fairground rides like the Gravitron and Pirate Ship. With the Physics Lab, no prior electronics knowledge is required. Students simply upload their sketch onto an Arduino board using Arduino Create for Chromebook, connect their Android mobile device to the board, build their project, and then use the onboard sensor and plug-and-play modules to simulate the rides’ dynamics."</em> <a href="https://blog.arduino.cc/2019/01/24/arduino-and-google-launch-new-arduino-education-science-kit/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Cellulose obtained from wood has amazing material properties. Empa researchers are now equipping the biodegradable material with additional functionalities to produce implants for cartilage diseases using 3D printing. It all starts with an ear. Empa researcher Michael Hausmann removes the object shaped like a human ear from the 3D printer and explains: «In viscous state cellulose nanocrystals can easily be shaped together with nother biopolymers into complex 3-dimensional structures using a 3D printer, such as the Bioplotter.” Once cross-linked, the structures remain stable despite their soft mechanical properties. Hausmann is currently investigating the characteristics of the nanocellulose composite hydrogels in order to further optimize their stability as well as the printing process. The researcher already used X-ray analysis to determine how cellulose is distributed and organized within the printed structures."</em> <a href="https://www.empa.ch/web/s604/ohr-aus-nanozellulose">[...]</a>

<p><em>"First-time precise measurement of gamma-ray bursts conducted successfully from a space station A detector called POLAR, developed at PSI, has been sent to outer space to collect data. In September 2016, the device was launched into Earth orbit on board the newest Chinese space station. From that vantage point, POLAR recorded so-called gamma-ray bursts flashing in the far reaches of the universe. Gamma-ray bursts are eruptions of extremely high-energy light that to a large extent are not well understood. Their origin, among other things, remains unclear; it is possible that these flashes of energetic light are emitted during the formation of black holes. To better understood gamma-ray bursts, POLAR measured a particular property of their light: the so-called polarisation."</em> <a href="https://www.psi.ch/media/measurement-of-five-flashes-from-the-depths-of-the-universe">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Physicists show quantum materials can be tuned for superconductivity Some iron-based superconductors could benefit from a tuneup, according to two studies by Rice University physicists and collaborators. “Our work demonstrates a new design principle for tuning quantum materials to achieve unconventional superconductivity at higher temperatures,” said Rice’s Qimiao Si, the lead theoretical physicist on the studies, which investigate unusual patterns of superconductivity that have previously been reported in iron selenide. “We show how nematicity, an unusual electronic order, can boost the chances that superconductivity will arise from electron-pairing in specific orbitals,” said Si, director of the Rice Center for Quantum Materials (RCQM) and the Harry C. and Olga K. Wiess Professor of Physics and Astronomy. “Tuning materials to enhance this effect could foster superconductivity at higher temperatures.” Electrical current heats wiring, thanks to the jostling of countless electrons, which lose energy each time they bump something. About 6 percent of electricity on U.S. power grids is lost to this heating, or electrical resistance, each year. In contrast, the electrons in superconductors form pairs that flow effortlessly, without resistance or heat."</em> <a href="http://news.rice.edu/2019/01/16/superconductors-due-for-a-tuneup%e2%80%a8-2/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Now in it's third version and having been tested for over two years, my weather station gets upgraded for better low power performance and data transfer reliability. Power consumption - not a problem in the months other than December and January, but in these very dark months the solar panel, although rated at 40 Watts, was unable to keep up with the demand of the system ... and most of the demand came from the 2G FONA GPRS module which transmits the data directly to the interwebs. The next problem was with the FONA GPRS module itself, or more probably the cell phone network. The device would work perfectly for weeks / months, but then suddenly stop for no apparent reason. Apparently the network does try to send some kind of 'system update info' which, if not accepted, causes the device to get booted off the network, so GPRS is not really a maintenance free solution for data transmission. It's a shame because when it did work, it worked really nicely."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Low-Power-Weather-Station/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"One major limitation during the development of an embedded system, especially for programmers who are used to PCs, is the lack of video output. That’s exactly what Vidout provides, using only 24% of the CPU on a STM32F103. It would be great to be able to be able to, at least temporarily, add video to a system during development and then remove it when it goes to the field. Unfortunately, creating video output is generally a rather resource intensive activity, and not one that can normally be patched in for development only. It is also ‘Hard Realtime’, in that the generation of video output must meet tight timing constraints if the display is to look right. Over the years I’ve built a lot of systems which I’ve claimed to have Realtime characteristics, but even so I’ve never really bumped against the limits of what is possible on a commodity processor, so, with a few evenings free over the Christmas break, I thought I’d see how far I could get at implementing a VGA output for debug use on a pretty much bottom-of-the-barrel CORTEX-M3; The STM32F103C8 based Bluepill board."</em> <a href="http://shadetail.com/blog/vga-video-out-on-bluepill/">[...]</a>

This object will be put on dikes, and it has to works without human interaction except a single visit per year.

But building a "bare-bone" dev kit with discrete logic components was no option since it needed a big power supply (since those ancient devices tend to take some serious current) and also the development would be very time intensive. And I want it now! Therefore, I designed the KIM Uno as a portable device, which fits in one hand and is powered by two CR2032 batteries.

It should be easy to integrate in existing equipment and by measuring the current consumption of the device, using AI and big data analysis malfunction could detect with high precision."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/bluetiger9/coolswitch-wireless-high-power-smart-switch-6fe824">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2G8A">ATtiny10 Thermometer</a></h2>

<p><em>"This is a small battery-powered thermometer that displays the temperature as a series of red and green flashes on an LED. The thermometer consists of an ATtiny10, a DS18B20 1-wire temperature sensor, and a bi-colour LED. To avoid the need for a digital display, and minimise current consumption, the thermometer pulses the temperature as a series of red or green flashes on the bi-colour LED. I designed it so I could seal it in a small waterproof enclosure and put it outside the window, allowing me to see the outdoor temperature from inside. It incorporates several power-saving features to enable it to run for over a year on a CR2032 button cell. Introduction Some time ago I designed a flashing thermometer based on an ATtiny85, using the ATtiny85's internal tempreature sensor: Flashing Thermometer."</em> <a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2G8A">[...]</a>
