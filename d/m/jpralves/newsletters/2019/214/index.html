<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1850, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Ferdinand_Braun">Karl Ferdinand Braun</a>. Este físico alemão partilhou o Prémio Nobel da Física em 1909 com Guglielmo Marconi pelo desenvolvimento do telegrafo sem fio. Ele publicou artigos sobre desvios da lei de Ohm e sobre os cálculos da força electromotriz de elementos galvânicos reversíveis de fontes térmicas, e descobriu (1874) o efeito do rectificador eléctrico. Ele demonstrou o primeiro osciloscópio de raios catódicos (tubo de Braun) em 1897, depois de trabalhar em correntes alternadas de alta frequência. Os tubos de raios catódicos já tinham sido caracterizados por raios não controlados; Braun conseguiu produzir um fluxo estreito de electrões, guiado por meio de voltagem alternada, que poderia traçar padrões numa tela fluorescente.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1932, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Scott">David Scott</a>. Este Astronauta norte-americano foi o primeiro a conduzir um veículo com rodas na Lua a 31 de Julho de 1971. O Foguetão Gemini 8 foi lançado em 16 de Março de 1966, com Scott e Neil Armstrong como tripulantes e conduziu a primeira ancoragem no espaço com um Agena. Scott voou na missão Apollo 9, lançada em 3 de Março de 1969, um teste de órbita terrestre de dez dias do primeiro conjunto completo de hardware da Apollo. Em 26 de Julho de 1971, Scott foi lançado na missão Apollo 15. Ele estava no comando do seu Módulo Lunar, que fez o quarto pouso lunar, tornou-se a sétima pessoa a andar na Lua e o primeiro a usar o veículo Lunar Rover na superfície da Lua. Isto fez parte de uma investigação científica de três dias, onde foram recolhidas cerca de 77 kg de amostras de rochas, e uma estação de ciência da ALSEP foi deixada no local de pouso para continuar a monitorização do ambiente lunar.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1933, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Rohrer">Heinrich Rohrer</a>. Este Físico suíço recebeu metade do Prémio Nobel de Física de 1986 com Gerd Binnig, pela invenção conjunta do microscópio de tunelamento. (Ernst Ruska recebeu a outra metade do prémio). O microscópio electrónico de Ruska dos anos 1930 foi incapaz de mostrar a estrutura da superfície no nível atómico. Rohrer e Binnig começaram a trabalhar em 1978 num microscópio de tunelamento de varredura no qual uma sonda fina passa a poucos angstroms da superfície da amostra. Uma voltagem positiva na sonda permite que os electrões se movam da amostra para a sonda pelo efeito de túnel, e a corrente detectada pode ser usada para manter a sonda a uma distância constante da superfície. À medida que a sonda se move em linhas paralelas, uma imagem 3D da superfície pode ser construída.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1943, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Smalley">Richard E. Smalley</a>. Este químico e físico norte-americano ficou conhecido como o pai da nano-tecnologia, que dividiu o Prémio Nobel de Química de 1996 com Robert F. Curl Jr. e Sir Harold W. Kroto pela descoberta conjunta, em 1985, de carbono (C60, ou Buckminsterfulereno, ou "buckyballs") e os fulerenos.</p>

<p>Completam-se hoje 35 anos desde o lançamento desse jogo mundialmente famoso chamado Tetris. O Tetris foi originalmente concebido e desenvolvido pelo programador russo Alexey Leonidovich Pajitnov. O seu nome é derivado das palavras "tetromino", que é uma forma geométrica composta por quatro quadrados, e "ténis", supostamente o desporto favorito de Pajitnov.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficamos a conhecer o novo pneu sem ar desenvolvido pela Michelin. Juntamente com a GM o prototipo MICHELIN Uptis (ou “Unique Puncture-proof Tire System”) foi apresentado. A tecnologia sem ar faz com que o Uptis Prototype elimine furos e rebentamento de pneus. Isto significa que o Uptis oferece um potencial significativo para reduzir o uso de matérias-primas e resíduos, contribuindo para a visão da GM para um mundo com zero colisões, zero emissões e zero congestionamentos.</p>

<p>Também esta semana a KLM e TU Delft unem forças para tornar a aviação mais sustentável. A KLM contribuirá para a pesquisa da TU Delft sobre um conceito de voo inovador conhecido como "Flying-V". O desenho em forma de V da aeronave integrará a cabine de passageiros, o porão de carga e os tanques de combustível nas asas. A sua forma aerodinâmica aperfeiçoada e peso reduzido significam que ele consome 20% menos combustível do que o Airbus A350, a aeronave mais avançada da actualidade. Um modelo em escala voadora e uma secção em tamanho real do interior do Flying-V serão oficialmente apresentados no KLM Experience Days no Aeroporto Schiphol de Amesterdão em Outubro, por ocasião do 100º aniversário da KLM.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou a Amazon, na sua conferência re: MARS, (Machine Learning, Automation, Robotics and Space), em Las Vegas, revelou o mais recente desenho de drones Prime Air. O objectivo destes drones é serem totalmente eléctricos e poder voar até 15 milhas e entregar pacotes com menos de cinco libras a clientes em menos de 30 minutos.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. É apresentada a revista newelectronics de 28 de Maio.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.gm.com/our-stories/technology/gm-takes-the-air-out-of-tires.html">Michelin, GM Take the Air Out of Tires for Passenger Vehicles</a></h2>

<p><em>"Michelin and General Motors presented a new generation of airless wheel technology, the MICHELIN Uptis Prototype (or “Unique Puncture-proof Tire System”), at the Movin’On Summit for sustainable mobility. GM intends to develop this airless wheel assembly with Michelin and aims to introduce it on passenger vehicles as early as 2024. Later this year, GM will initiate real-world testing and validation of the Uptis Prototype on a Michigan test fleet of Chevrolet Bolt EVs. “General Motors is excited about the possibilities that Uptis presents, and we are thrilled to collaborate with Michelin on this breakthrough technology,” said Steve Kiefer, senior vice president, Global Purchasing and Supply Chain, General Motors. “Uptis is an ideal fit for propelling the automotive industry into the future and a great example of how our customers benefit when we collaborate and innovate with our supplier partners.” Airless technology makes the Uptis Prototype eliminate flats and blowouts. This means Uptis offers significant potential for reducing the use of raw materials and waste, contributing to GM’s vision for a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion as it: Reduces the number of punctured or damaged tires that are scrapped before reaching the end of their life cycle."</em> <a href="https://www.gm.com/our-stories/technology/gm-takes-the-air-out-of-tires.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"KLM President &amp; CEO Pieter Elbers and Dean of the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering at Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) Professor Henri Werij today signed a new cooperative agreement to work together on making aviation more sustainable at the IATA Annual General Meeting in Seoul. KLM will be contributing towards TU Delft’s research into an innovative flight concept known as the “Flying-V”, which embraces an entirely different approach to aircraft design, in anticipation and support of sustainable long-distance flight in the future. The aircraft’s v-shaped design will integrate the passenger cabin, the cargo hold and the fuel tanks in the wings. Its improved aerodynamic shape and reduced weight will mean it uses 20% less fuel than the Airbus A350, today’s most advanced aircraft. A flying scale model and a full-size section of the interior of the Flying-V will be officially presented at the KLM Experience Days at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in October on the occasion of KLM’s 100th anniversary. The aircraft was originally conceptualised as a potential aircraft design for the future, but can be compared to today’s most advanced aircraft, the Airbus A350."</em> <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/2019/tu-delft/klm-and-tu-delft-join-forces-to-make-aviation-more-sustainable/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Amazon moves closer to its goal of a drone delivery solution that scales to meet the needs of customers. When we announced earlier this year that we were evolving our Prime two-day shipping offer in the U.S. to a one-day program, the response was terrific. But we know customers are always looking for something better, more convenient, and there may be times when one-day delivery may not be the right choice. Can we deliver packages to customers even faster? We think the answer is yes, and one way we’re pursuing that goal is by pioneering autonomous drone technology. Today at Amazon’s re:MARS Conference (Machine Learning, Automation, Robotics and Space) in Las Vegas, we unveiled our latest Prime Air drone design."</em> <a href="https://blog.aboutamazon.com/transportation/a-drone-program-taking-flight">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In this large celestial mosaic taken by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, there's a lot to see, including multiple clusters of stars born from the same dense clumps of gas and dust. Some of these clusters are older than others and more evolved, making this a generational stellar portrait. The grand green-and-orange delta filling most of the image is a faraway nebula, or a cloud of gas and dust in space. Though the cloud may appear to flow from the bright white spot at its tip, it is actually what remains of a much larger cloud that has been carved away by radiation from stars. The bright region is illuminated by massive stars, belonging to a cluster that extends above the white spot. The white color is the combination of four colors (blue, green, orange and red), each representing a different wavelength of infrared light, which is invisible to human eyes."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7413">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In a world that offers a seemingly unending number of options and opportunities, people may rely on the overall complexity of alternative options to help them make choices in uncertain environments, according to researchers. In a study recently published in the journal Cognition, the researchers found that when participants faced complex choices, they often showed a burst of exploration before settling into preferred options of higher value. Instead of trying to represent the values of all of the alternatives, adaptive decision-making was supported by selectively maintaining high-value options while forgetting the rest. This strategy may be one way that people can conserve their cognitive resources and solve problems that exceed their working memory capacity. It might, for example, explain why people have their go-to meals when they visit restaurants, said Michael Hallquist, assistant professor of psychology at Penn State and Institute for CyberScience co-hire. “There is a set of neural circuits — and cognitive processes that these circuits instantiate — that help you remember the value of different actions, so if you go to a restaurant and try the steak and it was fantastic, the next time you'll usually remember that," said Hallquist."</em> <a href="https://news.psu.edu/story/575221/2019/05/21/research/exploring-science-decision-making">[...]</a>

What could be better than putting an if (j==3 &amp;&amp; k>11) Debug(); statement into your program and to be able to get debug information out from the program when the variables meet the conditional requirements? So... I put together a C language interpreter for the ESP32 based boards that allows me to use their built-in file system for persistent program storage, to edit and Interpret my programs within a browser page without needing a compile and upload cycle. Better yet, I built in support for the common I/O Arduino functions such as analogWrite, digitalRead/Write, and supplied highly accurate servo positioning functions. But maybe the best part is that I added a debugger to the Interpreter that supports conditional Debug tracing, and conditional Watch functions that report variable values as the program executes."</em> <a href="https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5061494/Run-a-C-Language-Interpreter-on-Your-ESP32">[...]</a>

It uses a cross over detector to detect when the incoming 60Hz sine wave crosses the zero voltage point and derives a 60 Hz square wave. Over short time periods the frequency of the incoming sine wave from the power line may vary very slightly due to load, but over long periods of time it averages to 60Hz very precisely.

In a previous instructable I've assembled and improved an Anet A8 3D printer. And after a few improvements, this printer gives a nice result. In addition to a 3D printer, it can be useful to use a CNC machine or a laser cutter.

AC loads are everywhere around us because at least home appliances are supplied with the mains power. Therefore, we always face the situations that we want to have full control (dimming) over an AC load such as a lamp, a motor, vacuum cleaner etc. We should know that controlling an AC load is not identical with a DC load.

<p><em>"This project uses a potentiometer to control the display on a couple of 7-segment LED displays (F5161AH). As the potentiometer knob is turned the displayed number changes in the range 0 to 99. Only one LED is lit at any moment, very briefly, but the eye or a camera does not notice the flicker. This is persistence of vision. Pressing the button slows down the action and you can see the individual LEDs turning on and off. I've noticed that there are very few Instructables using CircuitPython so this project uses an Adafruit Itsybitsy M4 development board which runs CircuitPython beautifully."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Dual-7-segment-Displays-Controlled-by-Potentiomete/">[...]</a>
