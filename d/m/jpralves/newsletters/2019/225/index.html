<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1647, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Papin">Denis Papin</a>. Este físico franco-inglês inventou a panela de pressão em 1679. Ele ajudou o físico holandês Christiaan Huygens com experiências de bombeamento de ar e foi para Londres em 1675 para trabalhar com o físico inglês Robert Boyle. Alguns anos depois, Papin inventou a sua panela de pressão, um recipiente fechado com uma tampa bem justa que confinava o vapor a uma pressão mais alta, elevando consideravelmente o ponto de ebulição da água. Uma válvula de segurança de sua própria invenção impedia explosões. Observando que o vapor fechado no seu fogão tendia a levantar a tampa, Papin concebeu o uso de vapor para accionar um pistão num cilindro, o projecto básico para os primeiros motores a vapor. Ele nunca construiu um motor próprio, mas sua ideia foi melhorada por outros e levou ao desenvolvimento da máquina a vapor, uma contribuição importante para a Revolução Industrial.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1771, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Maudslay">Henry Maudslay</a>. Este engenheiro britânico foi o inventor do torno de metal e de outros dispositivos. Maudslay foi aprendiz do serralheiro Joseph Bramah e logo se tornou seu capataz. Quando ele saiu para trabalhar por conta própria, o primeiro emprego de Maudslay foi a construção de maquinaria para a fábrica de polias navais de Sir Marc Isambard Brunel. Através de três décadas durante a Revolução Industrial, Maudslay inventou várias máquinas importantes, mas de todas o torno de metal é particularmente notável. Ele também inventou métodos para imprimir tecidos de chita e para dessalinizar a água do mar para caldeiras de navios. Ele aperfeiçoou uma máquina de medição com precisão de 0,0001 polegada e produziu para sua oficina padrões precisos.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1867, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Francis_Jenkins">Charles Francis Jenkins</a>. Este norte-americano foi o inventor do altímetro, o motor de arranque do automóvel e de um copo em forma de cone, mas é conhecido especialmente como um pioneiro da televisão. Em maio de 1920, na reunião de Toronto da Society of Motion Picture Engineers, Jenkins apresentou seus "anéis prismáticos" como um dispositivo para substituir o obturador num projector de filmes. Esta invenção lançou as bases para sua primeira transmissão de radiodifusão. Ele alegou ter transmitido as primeiras imagens de silhuetas em movimento em 14 de Junho de 1923, mas sua primeira demonstração pública delas não ocorreu até Junho de 1925. Jenkins Laboratories construiu um transmissor de radiofrequência, W3XK, em Washington DC a estação de ondas curtas começou a transmitir radio-filmes em todo o leste dos EUA numa base regular em 2 de Julho de 1928.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1915, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hillier">James Hillier</a>. Este físico canadiano-americano foi o pesquisador pioneiro do microscópio electrónico. Com Albert Prebus, ele construiu o primeiro microscópio electrónico de sucesso na América do Norte (1939-40). As 41 patentes que ele detinha incluíam inovações em técnicas de difracção de electrões, secções ultra-finas e bacteriológicas. Para fazer a imagem de materiais como células sanguíneas ou bactérias sem destruí-los com o feixe de electrões, Hillier e outros desenvolveram métodos de preparação usando um filme coloidal para proteger as amostras. Ele trabalhou para a RCA desde 1940 por 37 anos. Ele continuou a melhorar o desenho e comercializou o microscópio electrónico para instituições de pesquisa em todo o mundo. Em 1958, tornou-se director dos laboratórios de pesquisa da empresa em Princeton. Na década de 1960, quando a RCA terminou sua fabricação de microscópios electrónicos, cerca de 2.000 tinham sido vendidos.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1943, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masatoshi_Shima">Masatoshi Shima</a>. Este engenheiro electrotécnico japonês foi um dos desenhadores do primeiro microprocessador do mundo, o Intel 4004, produzindo o desenho inicial de três chips da Busicom em 1968, antes de trabalhar com Ted Hoff, Stanley Mazor e Federico Faggin da Intel no projecto final de CPU de um único chip. Mais tarde, ele foi trabalhar para a Intel em 1972. Lá, ele trabalhou com Faggin para desenvolver o CPU Intel 8080, lançado em 1974. Shima então desenvolveu vários chips Intel para periféricos, alguns usados no IBM PC, como o controlador de interrupção 8259, chip de porta paralela 8255, o chip temporizador 8253, o chip de DMA 8257 e o chip USART de comunicação serie 8251. Posteriormente ele foi para a Zilog, onde trabalhou com Faggin para desenvolver o Zilog Z80 (1976) e o Z8000 (1979).</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou a empresa de inteligência artificial Cerebras apresentou o processador mais potente do mundo construído até hoje. Na conferencia Hot Chips realizada na universidade de Stanford, a empresa Cerebras apresentou uma maravilha da tecnologia moderna. Há tantas coisas que tornam a solução da Cerebras única que é difícil saber por onde começar. A Cerebras superou muitos desafios de desenho, fabricação e embalagem para desenvolver uma solução em escala de wafer chamada Wafer Scale Engine (WSE). Isto significa que o desenho usa todo o espaço utilizável da pastilha de silício como um único chip ou plataforma. A maioria dos chips é feita colocando 10 ou 100 unidades de um chip num wafer e depois cortando o wafer em fichas individuais. Usar um wafer inteiro como um único chip foi tentado em outras aplicações, mas foi abandonado por problemas de custo e rendimento. Um único wafer de 300 mm pode custar dezenas de milhares de dólares para produzir. No entanto, a menor partícula de poeira ou imperfeição na fabricação pode causar a falha de uma parte de um chip e, muitas vezes, a falha de todo o chip. Fabricar uma bolacha inteira sem um erro é impossível, mas a Cerebras encontrou uma maneira de contornar isso. O Cerebras WSE é feito de 84 blocos de processamento, semelhantes aos chips individuais, e cada bloco tem núcleos de processador, memória e E / S redundantes. Quando uma parte de um bloco falha, as funções extras são substituídas em seu lugar por meio de ferramentas de software, fazendo com que pareça um bloco totalmente funcional. Como resultado, a empresa pode teoricamente ter 100% de rendimento de todas as peças em um wafer e todas as wafers produzidas. No entanto, a fabricação é apenas uma parte da equação. Outra questão é o desafio de fornecer energia e arrefecimento a uma solução inteira em escala de bolacha. Com 400.000 núcleos de processador programáveis, 18 GB de memória e um tecido no chip capaz de 25 petabits, o WSE é composto por 1,2 biliões de transístores em 46.225 mm2 de silício (por contraste, é 56x maior que o maior GPU para IA - o NVIDIA GV100 - que é 815mm2). Além disso, o WSE gasta cerca de 15kW. O  fabrico foi feito pela TSMC que usou o processo de 16nm.</p>

<p>Também esta semana que passou a nave espacial indiana Chandrayaan-2 tirou a sua primeira fotografia lunar depois de ter entrado com sucesso na sua órbita. A fotografia foi tirada de cerca de 2.650 quilómetros acima da superfície lunar na quarta-feira (21 de Agosto). A fotografia mostra parte do outro lado da lua, incluindo a cratera Apollo e a Mare Orientalis. Funcionários da Organização de Pesquisa Espacial Indiana (ISRO) disseram que a operação correu bem e que a nave espacial Chandrayaan-2 deve colocar sua sonda na superfície da lua no início de Setembro.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. É também apresentada a revista Hackspace Magazine de Setembro.</p>

<p><em>"India's Chandrayaan-2 mission is in orbit around the moon, and its view is spectacular. The spacecraft entered lunar orbit on Aug. 19 (Aug. 20 local time at mission control in India), about a month after its launch, on July 22. In order to make the journey more feasible with a smaller rocket, the spacecraft took a long road to the moon, with about seven weeks between launch and the scheduled touchdown of the mission's lander and orbiter. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), which runs the Chandrayaan-2 mission, has now released the spacecraft's first image of the moon taken from orbit. That image was snapped from about 1,650 miles (2,650 kilometers) above the lunar surface on Wednesday (Aug. 21).

<h2><a href="https://news.stanford.edu/press-releases/2019/08/16/atomically-thin-ects-electronics/">Stanford builds a heat shield just 10 atoms thick to protect electronic devices</a></h2>

<p><em>"Atomically thin materials developed by Stanford researchers could create heat-shields for cell phones or laptops that would protect people and temperature-sensitive components and make future electronic gadgets even more compact. Excess heat given off by smartphones, laptops and other electronic devices can be annoying, but beyond that it contributes to malfunctions and, in extreme cases, can even cause lithium batteries to explode. To guard against such ills, engineers often insert glass, plastic or even layers of air as insulation to prevent heat-generating components like microprocessors from causing damage or discomforting users. Now, Stanford researchers have shown that a few layers of atomically thin materials, stacked like sheets of paper atop hot spots, can provide the same insulation as a sheet of glass 100 times thicker. In the near term, thinner heat shields will enable engineers to make electronic devices even more compact than those we have today, said Eric Pop, professor of electrical engineering and senior author of a paper published Aug. 16 in Science Advances. “We’re looking at the heat in electronic devices in an entirely new way,” Pop said."</em> <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/press-releases/2019/08/16/atomically-thin-ects-electronics/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Submerged system uses the vibration of “piezoelectric” materials to generate power and send and receive data. To investigate the vastly unexplored oceans covering most our planet, researchers aim to build a submerged network of interconnected sensors that send data to the surface — an underwater “internet of things.” But how to supply constant power to scores of sensors designed to stay for long durations in the ocean’s deep? MIT researchers have an answer: a battery-free underwater communication system that uses near-zero power to transmit sensor data. The system could be used to monitor sea temperatures to study climate change and track marine life over long periods — and even sample waters on distant planets. They are presenting the system at the SIGCOMM conference this week, in a paper that has won the conference’s “best paper” award. The system makes use of two key phenomena."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/battery-free-sensor-underwater-exploration-0820">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Innovative new electron spectroscopy technique pushes the limits of Nanospectroscopy for materials design In order to understand advanced materials like graphene nanostructures and optimize them for devices in nano-, opto- and quantum-technology it is crucial to understand how phonons – the vibration of atoms in solids – influence the materials’ properties. Researchers from the University of Vienna, the Advanced Institute of Science and Technology in Japan, the company JEOL and La Sapienza University in Rome have developed a method capable to measure all phonons existing in a nanostructured material. This is a breakthrough in the analysis of nanoscale functional materials and devices. With this pilot experiment using graphene nanostructures these researchers have shown the uniqueness of their approach, which will be published in the latest issue of Nature. Important thermal, mechanical, optoelectronic and transport characteristics of materials are ruled by phonons: the propagating atomic vibrational waves. It is then inferable that  the determination of such extended atomic vibrations is crucial for the optimization of nanoelectronic devices."</em> <a href="https://medienportal.univie.ac.at/presse/aktuelle-pressemeldungen/detailansicht/artikel/how-do-atoms-vibrate-in-graphene-nanostructures/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"· Patterning metals for electronics and solar cells can be slow, expensive and involve toxic chemicals · Scientists from the Department of Chemistry at the University of Warwick have developed a way to make patterned films of silver and copper (the two most conductive metals) using cheap organofluorine compounds and without using toxic chemicals. · This method is more sustainable and potentially much cheaper because it uses an extremely thin printed layer of organofluorine to prevent metal deposition, so metal is only deposited where it is needed. · It can be used to make electrodes for flexible solar panels, next generation sensors and low-emissivity glass An innovative way to pattern metals has been discovered by scientists in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Warwick, which could make the next generation of solar panels more sustainable and cheaper. Silver and copper are the most widely used electrical conductors in modern electronics and solar cells. However, conventional methods of patterning these metals to make the desired pattern of conducting lines are based on selectively removing metal from a film by etching using harmful chemicals or printing from costly metal inks. Scientists from the Department of Chemistry at the University of Warwick, have developed a way of patterning these metals that is likely to prove much more sustainable and cheaper for large scale production, because there is no metal waste or use of toxic chemicals, and the fabrication method is compatible with continuous roll-to-roll processing."</em> <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/greener_faster_and">[...]</a>

Quantum computing and quantum cryptography are expected to give much higher capabilities than their classical counterparts. For example, the computation power in a quantum system may grow at a double exponential rate instead of a classical linear rate due to the different nature of the basic unit, the qubit (quantum bit). Entangled particles enable the unbreakable codes for secure communications.

A potentially useful material for building quantum computers has been unearthed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), whose scientists have found a superconductor that could sidestep one of the primary obstacles standing in the way of effective quantum logic circuits. Newly discovered properties in the compound uranium ditelluride, or UTe2, show that it could prove highly resistant to one of the nemeses of quantum computer development — the difficulty with making such a computer’s memory storage switches, called qubits, function long enough to finish a computation before losing the delicate physical relationship that allows them to operate as a group. This relationship, called quantum coherence, is hard to maintain because of disturbances from the surrounding world. The compound’s unusual and strong resistance to magnetic fields makes it a rare bird among superconducting (SC) materials, which offer distinct advantages for qubit design, chiefly their resistance to the errors that can easily creep into quantum computation. UTe2’s exceptional behaviors could make it attractive to the nascent quantum computer industry, according to the research team’s Nick Butch."</em> <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2019/08/newfound-superconductor-material-could-be-silicon-quantum-computers">[...]</a>

This technique, which uses extreme ultraviolet (XUV) laser pulses to measure the dynamics of electrons via angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), is called time-resolved XUV ARPES. Unlike the synchrotron-based setup, this laser-based setup further provides a time-resolved feature to watch the electrons inside a material on a very fast, femtosecond (quadrillionth of a second) timescale.

In a study published this week in Nature Chemistry, the team details the design of organic molecules that are capable of generating two excitons per photon of light, a process called singlet fission. The excitons are produced rapidly and can live for much longer than those generated from their inorganic counterparts, which leads to an amplification of electricity generated per photon that is absorbed by a solar cell. “We have developed a new design rule for singlet fission materials,” said Luis Campos, an associate professor of chemistry and one of three principal investigators on the study. “This has led us to develop the most efficient and technologically useful intramolecular singlet fission materials to date. These improvements will open the door for more efficient solar cells.” All modern solar panels operate by the same process – one photon of light generates one exciton, Campos explained."</em> <a href="https://science.fas.columbia.edu/news/researchers-develop-materials-that-can-revolutionize-how-light-is-harnessed-for-solar-energy/">[...]</a>

A nanometer is one billionth of a meter, and a tungsten disulfide monolayer only contains one layer of tungsten atoms sandwiched between two layers of sulfur atoms. The approach is described in the Nano Letters paper “Atomically thin nonlinear transition metal dichalcogenide holograms,” which was published online Friday, Aug. 16. It involves the use of only a single nanopatterned tungsten disulfide monolayer that is able to control the wavefront of light, where the designed hologram patterns are punctured by a nanofabrication process known as focused ion beam milling."</em> <a href="https://news.mst.edu/2019/08/researchers-realize-worlds-thinnest-optical-hologram-with-2-d-material-monolayer/">[...]</a>

When the gel is touched with a crystal of the salt, it triggers an effect that turns it into a hard, opaque solid.

Thus, I could simulate games like: Ludo, Ladders and Snakes, Morris, Checkers, a bunch of different dice based games... Nowadays, unfortunately, children have lost interest in board games, what attracts them are the computer games with the most realistic graphics and audio effects, that require a large storage space and dynamic memory. Who knows, maybe working with them in carrying out this project, we will be able to distract them from the computer screens and point them to the basic games. Of course, I am aware that there are many other game projects on Arduino, but most of them are based on the use of an LCD or OLED display, I have seen very few projects similar to mine that only use RGB LEDs assembly to simulate games."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Playing-Chess-Against-Arduino/">[...]</a>
