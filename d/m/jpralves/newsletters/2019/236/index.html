<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1867, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Curie">Marie Curie</a>. Esta química e física polaco-francesa ficou conhecida pelas suas célebres experiências sobre minerais de urânio levaram à descoberta de dois novos elementos. Primeiro ela separou o polónio e alguns meses depois o rádio. A quantidade de rádon em equilíbrio radioactivo com um grama de rádio foi denominada curie (redefinida posteriormente como a emissão de 3,7 x 1010 partículas alfa por segundo.) Com Henri Becquerel e seu marido, Pierre Curie, ela recebeu o Prémio Nobel de 1903 por Física. Mais tarde, ela também foi a única ganhadora do segundo Prémio Nobel em 1911, desta vez em Química. A sua família ganhou cinco prémios Nobel em duas gerações. Ela morreu de envenenamento por radiação devido ao seu trabalho pioneiro.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1878, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lise_Meitner">Lise Meitner</a>. Esta Física austríaco-sueca partilhou o prémio Enrico Fermi com os químicos Otto Hahn e Fritz Strassmann pela sua pesquisa conjunta iniciada em 1934 que levou à descoberta da fissão de urânio. Ela recusou-se a trabalhar na bomba atômica. Em 1917, com Hahn, ela descobriu o novo elemento radioactivo protactinium. Ela foi a primeira a descrever a emissão de electrões Auger. Em 1935, ela encontrou evidências de quatro outros elementos radioactivos correspondentes aos números atómicos 93-96. Em 1938, ela foi forçada a deixar a Alemanha nazi e foi para um posto na Suécia. O seu outro trabalho no campo da física nuclear inclui o estudo de raios beta e o estudo das três principais séries de desintegração. Mais tarde, ela usou o ciclotrão como uma ferramenta.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1888 - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._V._Raman">Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman</a>. Este físico indiano  influenciou o crescimento da ciência na Índia com o seu trabalho. Ele ganhou o Prémio Nobel de Física de 1930 pela descoberta de 1928, agora chamada de espalhamento Raman: uma mudança na frequência observada quando a luz é espalhada num material transparente. Quando a luz monocromática ou a laser é passada através de um gás, líquido ou sólido transparente e é observada com o espectroscópio, a linha espectral normal associa-se a ela linhas de comprimento de onda mais longas e mais curtas, chamado espectro Raman. Tais linhas, causadas por fotões que perdem ou ganham energia em colisões elásticas com as moléculas da substância, variando com a substância. Assim, o efeito Raman é aplicado na análise química espectro-gráfica e na determinação da estrutura molecular.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que a maior turbina eólica flutuante do mundo, uma turbina eólica offshore classificada em ABS de 8,4 megawatt (MW), está prestes a ser instalada. É a primeira de três unidades do tipo submersível SEMI, classificadas em ABS, projectadas pela Principle Power que abriga turbinas MHI Vestas que conjugadas têm a capacidade total de 25 MWs de energia eólica offshore flutuante. Este é o primeiro parque eólico flutuante de grande escala da Europa continental, a 20 quilómetros da costa de Viana do Castelo em Portugal. O projeto é desenvolvido pelo consórcio Windplus, que é de propriedade conjunta da EDP Renováveis, ENGIE, Repsol e Principle Power Inc., e está calendarizado para entrar em operação no final de 2019.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. É apresentado também o livro "Raspberry Pi Beginner’s Guide v3".</p>

<p><em>"One year ago, on Nov. 5, 2018, NASA's Voyager 2 became only the second spacecraft in history to leave the heliosphere - the protective bubble of particles and magnetic fields created by our Sun. At a distance of about 11 billion miles (18 billion kilometers) from Earth - well beyond the orbit of Pluto - Voyager 2 had entered interstellar space, or the region between stars. Today, five new research papers in the journal Nature Astronomy describe what scientists observed during and since Voyager 2's historic crossing. Each paper details the findings from one of Voyager 2's five operating science instruments: a magnetic field sensor, two instruments to detect energetic particles in different energy ranges and two instruments for studying plasma (a gas composed of charged particles). Taken together, the findings help paint a picture of this cosmic shoreline, where the environment created by our Sun ends and the vast ocean of interstellar space begins. The Sun's heliosphere is like a ship sailing through interstellar space."</em> <a href="https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/news/details.php?article_id=116">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Microsoft and Warner Bros. have collaborated to successfully store and retrieve the entire 1978 iconic “Superman” movie on a piece of glass roughly the size of a drink coaster, 75 by 75 by 2 millimeters thick. It was the first proof of concept test for Project Silica, a Microsoft Research project that uses recent discoveries in ultrafast laser optics and artificial intelligence to store data in quartz glass. A laser encodes data in glass by creating layers of three-dimensional nanoscale gratings and deformations at various depths and angles. Machine learning algorithms read the data back by decoding images and patterns that are created as polarized light shines through the glass. The hard silica glass can withstand being boiled in hot water, baked in an oven, microwaved, flooded, scoured, demagnetized and other environmental threats that can destroy priceless historic archives or cultural treasures if things go wrong. It represents an investment by Microsoft Azure to develop storage technologies built specifically for cloud computing patterns, rather than relying on storage media designed to work in computers or other scenarios."</em> <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/innovation-stories/ignite-project-silica-superman/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2019/10/29/touchable-display-helps-blind-people-create/">Stanford increasing access to 3D modeling through touch-based display</a></h2>

<p><em>"Stanford researchers designed a tactile display that aims to make 3D printing and computer-aided design accessible to people who are blind and visually impaired. With the goal of increasing access to making, engineers at Stanford University have collaborated with members of the blind and visually impaired community to develop a touch-based display that mimics the geometry of 3D objects designed on a computer. Creating a 3D object with computer software is often the first step in producing it physically and can be burdensome for people who are blind or visually impaired. Even with 3D modeling software that has more accessible ways of inputting designs, they still have to evaluate their work by either creating a physical version they can touch or by listening to a description provided by a sighted person. “Design tools empower users to create and contribute to society but, with every design choice, they also limit who can and cannot participate,” said Alexa Siu, a graduate student in mechanical engineering at Stanford, who developed, tested and refined the system featured in this research. “This project is about empowering a blind user to be able to design and create independently without relying on sighted mediators because that reduces creativity, agency and availability.” This work is part of a larger effort within the lab of Sean Follmer, assistant professor of mechanical engineering, to develop tactile displays – displays that relay information through touch – for various purposes, such as human-computer interaction and new ways of sharing or explaining 3D information."</em> <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2019/10/29/touchable-display-helps-blind-people-create/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Navigation method may speed up autonomous last-mile delivery. In the not too distant future, robots may be dispatched as last-mile delivery vehicles to drop your takeout order, package, or meal-kit subscription at your doorstep — if they can find the door. Standard approaches for robotic navigation involve mapping an area ahead of time, then using algorithms to guide a robot toward a specific goal or GPS coordinate on the map. While this approach might make sense for exploring specific environments, such as the layout of a particular building or planned obstacle course, it can become unwieldy in the context of last-mile delivery. Imagine, for instance, having to map in advance every single neighborhood within a robot’s delivery zone, including the configuration of each house within that neighborhood along with the specific coordinates of each house’s front door.

The advancement, published online today in Tissue Engineering Part A, is a significant step toward creating grafts that are more like the skin our bodies produce naturally. “Right now, whatever is available as a clinical product is more like a fancy Band-Aid,” said Pankaj Karande, an associate professor of chemical and biological engineering and member of the Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies (CBIS), who led this research at Rensselaer. “It provides some accelerated wound healing, but eventually it just falls off; it never really integrates with the host cells.” A significant barrier to that integration has been the absence of a functioning vascular system in the skin grafts. Karande has been working on this challenge for several years, previously publishing one of the first papers showing that researchers could take two types of living human cells, make them into “bio-inks,” and print them into a skin-like structure. Since then, he and his team have been working with researchers from Yale School of Medicine to incorporate vasculature."</em> <a href="https://news.rpi.edu/content/2019/11/01/living-skin-can-now-be-3d-printed-blood-vessels-included">[...]</a>

This new fabrication method could not only simplify production of these fibers but also enable designs and applications that weren’t possible before. “Making silica optical fiber involves the labor-intensive process of spinning tubes on a lathe, which requires the fiber’s core or cores to be precisely centered,” explained John Canning who led the research team from the University of Technology in Sydney. “With additive manufacturing, there’s no need for the fiber geometry to be centered. This removes one of the greatest limitations in fiber design and greatly reduces the cost of fiber manufacturing.” In The Optical Society (OSA) journal Optics Letters, Canning’s group in collaboration with Gang-Ding Peng’s research team at the University of New South Wales in Sydney report the first silica glass fibers drawn from 3D printed preforms. “Additive manufacturing approaches such as 3D printing are well suited to change the entire approach to fiber design and purpose,” said Canning."</em> <a href="https://www.osa.org/en-us/about_osa/newsroom/news_releases/2019/researchers_use_3d_printing_to_make_glass_optical/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This project has no practical use at all, but was initiated as an exercise in implementing physics formulas related to gravity in C-code on an Arduino. To make things visible, a neopixel LED-strip with 74 LEDs was used. The effect of the gravitational acceleration on an object is demonstrated by using a MPU-6050 accelerometer and gyroscope chip. This chip is physically attached to the LED-strip, so when the LED-strip is held at a certain angle, the chip measures the angle of the LED strip and the Arduino uses this information to update the position of a virtual object as if it was a ball that is balanced on a beam and rolls from one side to the other if the beam is held at an angle. The position of the virtual object is indicated on the LED strip as a single LED that is illuminated. To update the position of a virtual object that is falling to the earth under the influence of gravity, we use the formula : y = y0 + (V0 * t) + (0.5 * a * t^2) With : y = travelled distance in meters y0 = start distance in meters v0 = start velocity in meters/second a = acceleration (gravity) in meters/second^2 t = time in seconds"</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/LEDs-and-Gravity-/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A low cost air quality monitoring device created with an aim to detect pollution hotspots caused due to traffic jams or factory emissions. Foreword The journey of this project began during a 'Design Thinking' project with a motive to design a system for measurement of localized Air Quality data for detecting pollution hotspots and alerting commuters of the same. The idea was to deploy large number of low cost devices across a geographic location to get this data, analyze it and use it for traffic management and city planning. Although quite visionary and ambitious, this project received a lot of appreciation at various levels and fared well in various competitions, it couldn't really move into the implementation phase. Lack of funds, expertise and less access to technology, hampered the progress of the project. However, I decided to publish this project (although fairly late - had developed this in 2018), as an attempt to inspire interested hacksters, to not just encourage learning but also hope for people to take it forward."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/256867/atmospheric-air-analyser-c467b1">[...]</a>

But the downside of these engravers was that they had a small work area, in most cases just 40mm X 40mm which is definitely way too small for my needs. So I thought why not design and 3D print my own laser engraver from scratch. I started the designing process in FUSION 360 while keeping in mind all the 3D printing tolerances. And finally came up with something really cool. Along the way, I decided to make the laser holder modular so that I can easily replace the laser with a pen or marker for pen plotting."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/DESIGN-AND-BUILD-a-WIRELESS-LASER-ENGRAVER-CUM-PEN/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This tutorial details the construction and basic programming for an Arduino and servo based SCARA (Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm) designed to dispense 4.5mm ball bearings. The design is open and easily modifiable, so with only slight modification this arm could be used for a variety of other purposes. All components needed are either common off-the-shelf parts or 3D printable, so hopefully this will be classroom friendly. This arm was designed for 9-12 grade classrooms due to small components and manual wiring. Standards for Technological Literacy 12 - Use and Maintain Products and Systems M/N (troubleshoot and maintain systems) - This robot arm, while designed reasonably, will require significant calibration effort and will need to be reprogrammed and developed for other tasks, much as real robot arms do. O (operate systems) - As this arm has no GUI or simulation software it must be programmed and operated through code manipulation and mathematical prediction."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-SCARA-Robot-Arm-Ball-Bearing-Placer/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A brighter UV-light for bar and event staff to scan customers' UV ink and ID cards. Our newest team member, Nick, is also a Bouncer for clubs and events here in Reno. He saw our powerful UV LEDs in the shop and brought over what the local clubs use. We saw that what they use is super under-powered and very directional. We therefore got the idea to make the "The UV HotBox" because these LEDs get very hot! Warning, we're moving fast here with potentially dangerous UV LEDs."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/GroupGets/5-8-watt-uv-box-the-uv-hotbox-5549b7">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Having built a simple single-eye mechanism in the past, I wanted to improve on the design as well as making it more accessible to the maker community. The updated assembly uses parts that can easily be bought online, and almost all the components can be printed easily without supports. Designing the model in this way does sacrifice some functionality, but I'll be releasing an optimised design in the future. This project is ideal if you want to build a functional and realistic eye mechanism, but don't necessarily have access to tools like a lathe or speciality components. Another feature of this design is that it's designed to use snap-in eyes which can be replaced, and used with other 3d printed components to cast a highly realistic dome over the painted eye. This process is quite involved so I have another instructable on how to make the eyes, but if you'd prefer to use simple 3d printed eyes you can do that too."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Simplified-3D-Printed-Animatronic-Dual-Eye-Mechani/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Use flow rate sensor to capture water consumption in household and provide visual information via web apps. 1.0 Background: The project aims to use a flow-rate sensor to capture water consumption of a household and upload the information of water used and water bill to the web to allow residents to view them in smart devices. 2.0 Project planning: We made use of a DC pump to simulate water flow into the household. The pump speed is varied by a voltage controller to assimilate real-life conditions of varying water flowing over time. The water pump and flow rate sensor are mounted along a water piping to detect the amount of water flow into the household.
