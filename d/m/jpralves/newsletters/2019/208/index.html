<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1769, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Isambard_Brunel">Marc Isambard Brunel</a>. Este engenheiro e inventor franco-inglês resolveu o problema histórico do tunelamento subaquático. Um inventor prolífico, Brunel projectou máquinas para serrar e dobrar madeira, fazer sapatas, tricotar e imprimir. Como engenheiro civil, os seus projectos incluíam a ponte suspensa Île de Bourbon e as primeiras marinas flutuantes em Liverpool. Em 1818, no entanto, Brunel patenteou o escudo de tunelamento, um dispositivo que possibilitava a passagem de túneis com segurança através de camadas de água. Em 2 de Março de 1825, começaram as operações de construção de um túnel sob o rio Tamisa, entre Rotherhithe e Wapping. O Thames Tunnel foi finalmente inaugurado em 25 de Março de 1843. Tem uma secção transversal de ferradura gémea com altura de 7m, largura de 11m e comprimento total de 406m.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1849, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Klein">Felix Klein</a>. Este matemático alemão cuja síntese da geometria como o estudo das propriedades de um espaço que são invariantes sob um dado grupo de transformações, conhecido como Programa Erlanger, influenciou profundamente o desenvolvimento matemático. Ele criou a garrafa de Klein, uma superfície fechada unilateral. Uma garrafa de Klein não pode ser construída no espaço euclidiano. É melhor retratado como um cilindro que se volta através de si mesmo para se unir à outra extremidade. No entanto, esta não é uma superfície contínua em três espaços, pois a superfície não pode passar por si mesma sem uma descontinuidade. É possível construir uma garrafa de Klein no espaço não-euclidiano.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1854, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sumner_Tainter">Charles Sumner Tainter</a>. Este inventor americano de vários instrumentos de gravação de som, incluindo o fotofone (1880, com Alexander Graham Bell), um instrumento para transmitir o som a uma distância através da agência de luz, usando células sensíveis de selénio. Ele também desenvolveu o Graphophone (1881, patenteado em 1886; com Chichester A. Bell, primo de Alexander Graham Bell). Isto melhorou muito a superfície de papel alumínio e a ponta rígida usada por Thomas Edison. Tainter inventou um cilindro de papelão revestido de cera e uma caneta de gravação flexível que incorpora as ranhuras (em vez de estampagem) para obter uma melhor reprodução, tornando o fonógrafo e o dictografo comercialmente possíveis.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1874, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guglielmo_Marconi">Guglielmo Marconi</a>. Este engenheiro electrotécnico italiano e inventor que inventou o telégrafo sem fio (1935) conhecido hoje como rádio. Prémio Nobel (1909). Em 1894, Marconi começou a experimentar as “Ondas Hertzianas”, as ondas de rádio que Heinrich Hertz produziu no seu laboratório alguns anos antes. Na falta de apoio do Ministério italiano dos Correios e Telégrafos, Marconi recorreu ao British Post Office. Demonstrações encorajadoras em Londres e na planície de Salisbury seguiram-se. Marconi obteve a primeira patente mundial de um sistema de telegrafia sem fio, em 1897, e abriu a primeira fábrica de rádio do mundo em Chelmsford, Inglaterra, em 1898. Em 1900, ele levou a sua famosa patente nº 7777 para “telegrafia sintonizada ou sintónica”.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1900, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Pauli">Wolfgang Pauli</a>. Este físico astro-americano foi laureado com o Prémio Nobel de Física em 1945 pela sua descoberta em 1925 do princípio de exclusão de Pauli, que afirma que num átomo dois electrões não podem ocupar o mesmo estado quântico simultaneamente. Este princípio relaciona claramente a teoria quântica com as propriedades observadas dos átomos.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1903, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Kolmogorov">Andrey Kolmogorov</a>. Este matemático russo cujos postulados básicos da teoria da probabilidade continuaram a ser parte integrante da análise. Este trabalho teve diversas aplicações, como seu estudo do movimento dos planetas (1954), ou o fluxo de ar de um motor a jacto (1941). Na topologia, ele investigou grupos de cohomologia. Ele fez uma grande contribuição para responder à parte de probabilidade do sexto problema de Hilbert e resolveu (1957) o Décimo Terceiro Problema de Hilbert.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que a NASA registou o primeiro ruído sísmico em Marte. A partir da Insight o fraco sinal sísmico, detectado pelo instrumento Sísmico de Experimentação para Estrutura Interior (SEIS), foi registado a 6 de Abril, o dia marciano de 128º, ou sol. Este é o primeiro tremor registado que parece ter vindo de dentro do planeta, em oposição a ser causado por forças acima da superfície, como o vento. Os cientistas ainda estão examinando os dados para determinar a causa exacta do sinal.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. É apresentada a revista MagPI nº 81 e o livro "Wearable Tech Projects".</p>

<p><em>"NASA's Mars InSight lander has measured and recorded for the first time ever a likely "marsquake." The faint seismic signal, detected by the lander's Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS) instrument, was recorded on April 6, the lander's 128th Martian day, or sol. This is the first recorded trembling that appears to have come from inside the planet, as opposed to being caused by forces above the surface, such as wind. Scientists still are examining the data to determine the exact cause of the signal. "InSight's first readings carry on the science that began with NASA's Apollo missions," said InSight Principal Investigator Bruce Banerdt of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California. "We've been collecting background noise up until now, but this first event officially kicks off a new field: Martian seismology!""</em> <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8430/nasas-insight-detects-first-likely-quake-on-mars/?site=insight">[...]</a>

<p><em>"On April 10, 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) unveiled the first-ever image of a black hole's event horizon, the area beyond which light cannot escape the immense gravity of the black hole. That giant black hole, with a mass of 6.5 billion Suns, is located in the elliptical galaxy Messier 87 (M87). EHT is an international collaboration whose support in the U.S. includes the National Science Foundation. This image from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope shows the entire M87 galaxy in infrared light. The EHT image, by contrast, relied on light in radio wavelengths and showed the black hole's shadow against the backdrop of high-energy material around it. Located about 55 million light-years from Earth, M87 has been a subject of astronomical study for more than 100 years and has been imaged by many NASA observatories, including the Hubble Space Telescope, the Chandra X-ray Observatory and NuSTAR."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7385">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In unveiling the specs of his new self-driving car computer at this week’s Tesla Autonomy Day investor event, Elon Musk made several things very clear to the world. First, Tesla is raising the bar for all other carmakers. Second, Tesla’s self-driving cars will be powered by a computer based on two of its new AI chips, each equipped with a CPU, GPU, and deep-learning accelerators. The computer delivers 144 trillion operations per second (TOPS), enabling it to collect data from a range of surround cameras, radars and ultrasonics and power deep neural network algorithms. Third, Tesla is working on a next-generation chip, which says 144 TOPS isn’t enough. At NVIDIA, we have long believed in the vision Tesla reiterated: self-driving cars require computers with extraordinary capabilities."</em> <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2019/04/23/tesla-self-driving/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.colorado.edu/today/2019/04/18/lasers-make-magnets-behave-fluids">Lasers make magnets behave like fluids</a></h2>

<p><em>"For years, researchers have pursued a strange phenomenon: When you hit an ultra-thin magnet with a laser, it abruptly de-magnetizes. Imagine the magnet on your refrigerator suddenly falling off. Now, scientists at CU Boulder are digging into how magnets recover from that change, regaining their properties in a fraction of a second. According to a study published this week in Nature Communications, zapped magnets actually behave like fluids. Their magnetic properties begin to form “droplets,” similar to what happens when you shake up a jar of oil and water. To find that out, CU Boulder’s Ezio Iacocca, Mark Hoefer and their colleagues drew on mathematical modeling, numerical simulations and experiments conducted at Stanford University’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory."</em> <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/today/2019/04/18/lasers-make-magnets-behave-fluids">[...]</a>

<p><em>"More than 113,000 people are currently on the national transplant list. And with a shortage of donors, this means that about 20 people will die every day while waiting for an organ, according to the U.S. Department of Health. But this could change thanks to researchers at UC Berkeley, who have developed a device that may be key to the viability of bioprinting, an extension of 3D printing that allows living tissue, bone, blood vessels and even whole organs to be printed on demand. A paper on this work was recently published in the Journal of Medical Devices. Currently, there are two major hurdles standing in the way of organ printing. Because living cells and functioning organs require specialized temperature and chemical conditions to survive, cells deteriorate during the actual 3D printing of a large organ because the process is too slow."</em> <a href="https://engineering.berkeley.edu/2019/04/mass-producing-biomaterials">[...]</a>

So far, however, the transfer of the current from the bacteria to a receiving electrode has not been efficient at all. Now, researchers from institutions including Lund University have achieved a slightly more efficient transfer of electrical current. One of society’s greatest challenges is to meet the need for renewable and sustainable energy.

<p><em>"A new method allows the quantum state of atomic “qubits” — the basic unit of information in quantum computers — to be measured with 20 times less error than was previously possible, without losing any atoms. Accurately measuring qubit states, which are analogous to the one or zero states of bits in traditional computing, is a vital step in the development of quantum computers. A paper describing the method by researchers at Penn State appears March 25, 2019 in the journal Nature Physics. “We are working to develop a quantum computer that uses a three-dimensional array of laser-cooled and trapped cesium atoms as qubits,” said David Weiss, professor of physics at Penn State and the leader of the research team. “Because of how quantum mechanics works, the atomic qubits can exist in a ‘superposition’ of two states, which means they can be, in a sense, in both states simultaneously. To read out the result of a quantum computation, it is necessary to perform a measurement on each atom."</em> <a href="https://news.psu.edu/story/565170/2019/03/25/research/extremely-accurate-measurements-atom-states-developed-quantum">[...]</a>

Researchers from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology have found superinjection to be possible in homostructures, which are made of a single material. This opens up entirely new prospects for the development of light sources. The paper came out Feb. 21 in the journal Semiconductor Science and Technology.

<p><em>"Scientists at Brookhaven Lab's Center for Functional Nanomaterials are developing an automated system to synthesize entirely new materials made from stacked atomically thin two-dimensional sheets and to characterize their exotic quantum properties Checking out a stack of books from the library is as simple as searching the library’s catalog and using unique call numbers to pull each book from their shelf locations. Using a similar principle, scientists at the Center for Functional Nanomaterials (CFN)—a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science User Facility at Brookhaven National Laboratory—are teaming with Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to create a first-of-its-kind automated system to catalog atomically thin two-dimensional (2-D) materials and stack them into layered structures. Called the Quantum Material Press, or QPress, this system will accelerate the discovery of next-generation materials for the emerging field of quantum information science (QIS). Structures obtained by stacking single atomic layers (“flakes”) peeled from different parent bulk crystals are of interest because of the exotic electronic, magnetic, and optical properties that emerge at such small (quantum) size scales. However, flake exfoliation is currently a manual process that yields a variety of flake sizes, shapes, orientations, and number of layers. Scientists use optical microscopes at high magnification to manually hunt through thousands of flakes to find the desired ones, and this search can sometimes take days or even a week, and is prone to human error."</em> <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=214343">[...]</a>

The first-generation robot used a flat kirigami sheet, which transformed uniformly when stretched.

<p><em>"Ripples in spacetime lead to new way to determine size and age of universe On the morning of Aug. 17, 2017, after traveling for more than a hundred million years, the aftershocks from a massive collision in a galaxy far, far away finally reached Earth. These ripples in the fabric of spacetime, called gravitational waves, tripped alarms at two ultra-sensitive detectors called LIGO, sending texts flying and scientists scrambling. One of the scientists was Prof. Daniel Holz at the University of Chicago. The discovery had provided him the information he needed to make a groundbreaking new measurement of one of the most important numbers in astrophysics: the Hubble constant, which is the rate at which the universe is expanding. The Hubble constant holds the answers to big questions about the universe, like its size, age and history, but the two main ways to determine its value have produced significantly different results. Now there was a third way, which could resolve one of the most pressing questions in astronomy—or it could solidify the creeping suspicion, held by many in the field, that there is something substantial missing from our model of the universe."</em> <a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/how-use-gravitational-waves-measure-expansion-universe">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Study shows evidence of topological superconductivity in planar structures Researchers have been trying for many years to build a quantum computer that industry could scale up, but the building blocks of quantum computing, qubits, still aren’t robust enough to handle the noisy environment of what would be a quantum computer. A theory developed only two years ago proposed a way to make qubits more resilient through combining a semiconductor, indium arsenide, with a superconductor, aluminum, into a planar device. Now, this theory has received experimental support in a device that could also aid the scaling of qubits. This semiconductor-superconductor combination creates a state of “topological superconductivity,” which would protect against even slight changes in a qubit’s environment that interfere with its quantum nature, a renowned problem called “decoherence.” The device is potentially scalable because of its flat “planar” surface – a platform that industry already uses in the form of silicon wafers for building classical microprocessors. The work, published in Nature, was led by the Microsoft Quantum lab at the University of Copenhagen’s Niels Bohr Institute, which fabricated and measured the device. The Microsoft Quantum lab at Purdue University grew the semiconductor-superconductor heterostructure using a technique called molecular beam epitaxy, and performed initial characterization measurements."</em> <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2019/Q2/new-robust-device-may-scale-up-quantum-tech,-researchers-say.html">[...]</a>

A thermoset with reorganizable crosslinks retains its useful properties, but has recyclability built in. The fact that most currently used plastics cannot be easily recycled has produced severe environmental problems, caused considerable losses to the global economy and depleted finite natural resources1,2. Of the most widely used plastics today, thermosets are of great interest for high-performance applications, but are particularly impractical for recycling because they cannot be reprocessed using heat or solvents. Writing in Nature Chemistry, Christensen et al.3 report thermosets formed using covalent links known as diketoenamines, which can be reorganized within the material’s polymer network. Remarkably, the diketoenamines allow the plastics to be recycled in an energy-efficient process to regenerate pristine monomers, which can then be used to make thermosets that are almost identical to the original material."</em> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01209-3">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Programming is always fun and Arduino is a wonderful platform if you are just getting started with Embedded programming. In this tutorial we will build our own calculator with Arduino. The values can be sent in through a keypad (44 keypad) and result can be viewed on a LCD screen (162 Dot-matrix). This calculator could perform simple operations like Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division with whole numbers. But once you understand the concept you can implement even scientific functions with Arduinos built in functions.At the end of this project you will know how to use a 16x2 LCD and Keypad with Arduino and also how easy it is to program for them using the readily available libraries. You will also understand how to program your Arduino for accomplishing a particular task."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Calculator-2/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The idea behind this project is that if you have an RFID credit card, you can tell your bank that you need a replacement card, then once you have that second card, you can dissolve it in acetone, take out the RFID chip, solder a new antenna to it, glue that assembly to an inner frame, then put that assembly in a mold made from the full-size ring, pour resin around it, then have a ring that will let you pay at any establishment that accepts RFID credit cards (you'll be able to use your ring at pretty much anywhere that accepts google/apple pay) without you needing to take out your wallet. To find out if your card has RFID contactless payment options, look for this symbol on the front or back: https://imgur.com/rQDpAac If it doesn't, you can also call your bank and see if they have them available. My card did not have RFID but they were able to send me one that did when I called and asked. I'd suggest reading through everything in this instructable before starting in on this.

Unfortunately ScArY was based on a premanufactured development board (QYF-TM1638) and was restricted to a 7 segment display. Beside an ATTINY85 microcontroller SCOTT is based on an OLED display and a 16 key one wire keypad. As SCOTT is powered by one 3V battery only a good power management is essential. Two of the five regular I/O-pins of the ATTINY are used to control the display (I2C communication) and one (analog) pin is used to handle the one wire keypad.
