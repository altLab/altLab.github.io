<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1791, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mercer_(scientist)">John Mercer</a>. Este químico e industrial inglês inventou o processo de mercerização para o tratamento de algodão que ainda está em uso hoje e foi um pioneiro na fotografia colorida. A partir dos 16 anos, e durante toda a sua vida, ele investigou e desenvolveu corantes têxteis químicos. No final da sua vida, em 1844, ele descobriu que quando o algodão é tratado com produtos químicos cáusticos, ele fica mais espesso e mais curto - portanto, mais resistente e resistente a encolhimento. Além disso, o algodão era mais facilmente tingido, necessitava de 30% menos corante, mais absorvente e poderia receber um atraente brilho sedoso. Ele chamou ao seu processo de mercerização e patenteou-o em 1850. A mercerização foi aplicada a muitos outros materiais, como pergaminho e tecido de lã, e continua sendo uma parte importante do processo de acabamento do algodão hoje.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1951, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_McDonough">William McDonough</a>. Este arquitecto e engenheiro ambiental norte-americano, promove o design de produtos para um futuro sustentável “upcycling” - para substituir a mera reciclagem por métodos para processar materiais de forma a melhorá-los para reutilização. Com Michael Braungart, ele escreveu um livro, Cradle to Cradle, no qual cunhou a palavra “upcycling”. Por exemplo, quando o papel é reciclado agora, o produto perde qualidade à medida que o comprimento da fibra diminui, precisa de mais cloração e está contaminado com tinta tóxica. Em vez disso, as árvores podem ser salvas para o papel de reabastecimento de oxigénio. Páginas leves impressas podem ser feitas de resinas plásticas que podem ser recicladas indefinidamente, com tintas que são lavadas em banhos a 180 graus.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que a Western Digital publicou uma abstração de design de nível de transferência de registo (RTL) do seu RISC-V com núcleo SweRV projetado internamente. O núcleo SweRV é um dos vários projetos RISC-V que a empresa desenvolveu como parte de seus esforços para liderar a ISA, seu ecossistema, e promover a sua própria transição para outros núcleos de CPU que não sejam licenciados e que não cobrem royalties. De acordo com os objectivos de design mais abertos do RISC-V, a publicação da representação de alto nível da SweTV significa que terceiros podem usá-la nos seus próprios projectos de chip, o que popularizará não apenas o design específico, mas também a arquitectura RISC-V em geral.</p>

<p>Também esta semana a sonda Japonesa Hayabusa-2 aterrou num asteróide na tentativa de obter amostras de rocha da sua superfície. A agência espacial japonesa (Jaxa) tinha planeado inicialmente realizar a operação de aterragem em Outubro do ano passado. Mas a superfície do asteróide é muito mais acidentada do que o esperado, com numerosas pedras pesadas dificultando a localização de um local grande e plano o suficiente para ser feita a recolha das amostras.</p>

<p>Hoje a SpaceX lançará o foguetão Falcon 9 em direcção à Lua com um modulo lunar israelita. Se a aterragem do módulo for bem sucedido, este será o primeiro feito com financiamento privado a alcançar a superfície lunar. A sonda, chamada "Beresheet" (no começo), será lançada às 20h45. EST (0145 GMT, 22 de Fevereiro) a partir do Cabo Canaveral, na Florida. Aproximadamente 30 minutos após a descolagem do Falcon 9, o Beresheet separar-se-á do foguete numa órbita de transferência a uma altitude de cerca de 60.000 quilómetros. Dois minutos após a separação, a nave espacial enviará sua primeira comunicação ao centro de controle da missão, em Yehud, Israel.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. É apresentada a revista Hackspace nº 16 assim como quatro livros sobre a linguagem Go.</p>

<p><em>"Western Digital has published a register-transfer level (RTL) design abstraction of its in-house designed SweRV RISC-V core. The SweRV core is one of several RISC-V projects the company as undertaken as part of their effort to spearhead the ISA, its ecosystem, and foster their own transition away from licensed, royalty-charging CPU cores. In accordance with the more open design goals of RISC-V, the publication of the high-level representation of SweTV means that third parties can use it in their own chip designs, which will popularize not only the particular core design, but also the RISC-V architecture in general. The RTL design abstraction of Western Digital’s RISC-V SweRV core is now available at GitHub. The design is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license, which is a very permissive (and non-copyleft) license that allows the core to be used free of charge, with or without modifications, and without requiring any modifications to be released in-kind. In fact the requirements of the license are quite slim; besides requiring appropriate attribution, the only other notable restriction is that third party developers cannot use Western Digital’s brands to mark their work."</em> <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/13964/western-digitals-riscv-swerv-core-released-for-free">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A Japanese spacecraft has touched down on an asteroid in an attempt to collect a sample of rock from the surface. The Hayabusa-2 probe was trying to grab the sample from a pre-chosen site on the asteroid Ryugu just before 23:00 GMT on 21 February. The spacecraft reached asteroid Ryugu in June 2018 after a three-and-a-half-year journey from Earth. It is expected to return to Earth with the rocky material it has cached in 2020. During sample collection, the spacecraft was set to approach the 1km-wide asteroid with an instrument called the sampler horn. On touchdown, a 5g projectile made of the metal tantalum should have been fired into the rocky surface at 300m/s."</em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-47293317">[...]</a>

<p><em>"SpaceX will launch an Israeli robotic lunar lander during the company's Falcon 9 rocket launch tomorrow (Feb. 21). If the lander succeeds, this will be the first privately funded moonshot to reach the lunar surface. The lander, called "Beresheet" (in the beginning), will launch at 8:45 p.m. EST (0145 GMT, Feb. 22) from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. You can watch the launch live on Space.com courtesy of SpaceX or directly through SpaceX's webcast page or on Facebook via the lander's creators. The Beresheet lander is a joint venture between Israeli nonprofit SpaceIL — one of the participants in the Google Lunar X Prize, which challenged companies to land spacecraft on the moon — and Israel Aerospace Industries, the country's largest aerospace and defense company. While the $30 million Google Lunar X Prize challenge ended with no winner in 2018, several participating companies said they are continuing work on their concepts."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-to-launch-israeli-moon-lander.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.anl.gov/article/superinsulators-to-become-scientists-quark-playgrounds">Superinsulators to become scientists' quark playgrounds</a></h2>

<p><em>"Interdisciplinary research team achieves fundamental quark breakthrough. Scientists widely accept the existence of quarks, the fundamental particles that make up protons and neutrons. But information about them is still elusive, since their interaction is so strong that their direct detection is impossible and exploring their properties indirectly often requires extremely expensive particle colliders and collaborations between thousands of researchers. So, quarks remain conceptually foreign and strange like the Cheshire cat in ​“Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland,” whose grin is detectable — but not its body. An international group of scientists that includes materials scientist Valerii Vinokur from the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory have developed a new method for exploring these fundamental particles that exploits an analogy between the behavior of quarks in high-energy physics and that of electrons in condensed-matter physics. This discovery will help scientists formulate and conduct experiments that could provide conclusive evidence for quark confinement, asymptotic freedom, and other phenomena, such as whether superinsulators can exist in both two and three dimensions."</em> <a href="https://www.anl.gov/article/superinsulators-to-become-scientists-quark-playgrounds">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A research team comprising members from City University of Hong Kong (CityU), Harvard University and renowned information technologies laboratory Nokia Bell Labs has successfully fabricated a tiny on-chip lithium niobate modulator, an electro-optic modulator which is more efficient, with faster data transmission and lower costs. It is set to revolutionise the industry and CityU researchers are looking into its application for the coming 5G communication. Electro-optic modulators are critical components in modern communications. They convert high-speed electronic signals in computational devices such as computers to optical signals before transmitting them through optical fibres. However, the existing and commonly used lithium niobate modulators require a high drive voltage which is significantly higher than that provided by a typical CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) circuitry. Hence an electrical amplifier that makes the whole device bulky, expensive and high energy-consuming is needed."</em> <a href="https://newscentre.cityu.edu.hk/media/news/2019/01/28/faster-and-more-energy-efficient-modulator-sets-revolutionise-optoelectronic-industry">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Tiny moving particles make up everything in our physical world— including modern electronics, whose function relies on the movement of negatively-charged electrons. Physicists strive to understand the forces that push these particles into motion, with the goal of harnessing their power in new technologies. Quantum computers, for instance, employ a fleet of precisely controlled electrons to take on goliath computational tasks. Recently, researchers at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST) demonstrated how a form of light, called microwaves, cuts in on the movement of electrons. The findings may help improve quantum computing. Normal computers run on zeros and ones, and this binary code limits the volume and type of information the machines can process."</em> <a href="https://www.oist.jp/news-center/news/2019/1/31/questions-quantum-computing-how-move-electrons-light">[...]</a>

In a paper published today in Science Robotics, engineers at Brigham Young University detail new technology that allows them to build complex mechanisms into the exterior of a structure without taking up any actual space below the surface. This new class of mechanisms, called “developable mechanisms,” get their name from developable surfaces, or materials that can take on 3-D shapes from flat conformations without tearing or stretching, like a sheet of paper or metal. They reside in a curved surface (like, say, the arms of Iron Man’s suit) and can transform or morph when deployed to serve unique functions. When not in use, they can fold back into the surface of the structure seamlessly. “These new discoveries make it possible to build complex machines that integrate with surfaces to be very compact, but can deploy and do complex tasks,” said researcher Larry Howell, professor of mechanical engineering at BYU."</em> <a href="https://news.byu.edu/news/byu-researchers-unfold-new-class-mechanical-devices">[...]</a>

The project is a collaboration involving NIST, the University of Colorado Boulder (CU) and Pennsylvania State University, the primary partner in the telescope and spectrograph. The new comb apparatus for the first time provides the precision needed for discovering and characterizing planets orbiting M dwarf stars, which comprise 70 percent of the stars in the galaxy and are plentiful near Earth, the research team reported in Optica. “The comb immediately allowed our Penn State colleagues to make measurements they could not otherwise make,” NIST Fellow Scott Diddams said. “These improved tools should allow us to find habitable planets around the most ubiquitous stars in our galaxy.” A star's nuclear furnace emits white light, which is modified by elements in the atmosphere that absorb certain narrow bands of color.

Fireflies and LEDs face similar challenges in releasing the light that they produce because the light can reflect backwards and is lost."</em> <a href="https://news.psu.edu/story/559722/2019/02/18/research/firefly-inspired-surfaces-improve-efficiency-led-lightbulbs">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Engineers aim to use “silicon interconnect fabric” to build a computer with 40 GPUs on a single silicon wafer Back in the 1980s, parallel computing pioneer Gene Amdahl hatched a plan to speed mainframe computing: a silicon-wafer-sized processor. By keeping most of the data on the processor itself instead of pushing it through a circuit board to memory and other chips, computing would be faster and more energy efficient. With US $230 million from venture capitalists, the most ever at the time, Amdahl founded Trilogy Systems to make his vision a reality. This first commercial attempt at “wafer-scale integration” was such a disaster that it reportedly introduced the verb “to crater” into the financial press lexicon. Engineers at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and at University of California Los Angeles think it’s time for another go.

Rice’s Kaiyuan Yang and Dai Li will present their physically unclonable function (PUF) technology today at the 2019 International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC), a prestigious scientific conference known informally as the “Chip Olympics.” PUF uses a microchip’s physical imperfections to produce unique security keys that can be used to authenticate devices linked to the Internet of Things. Considering that some experts expect Earth to pass the threshold of 1 trillion internet-connected sensors within five years, there is growing pressure to improve the security of IoT devices. Yang and Li’s PUF provides a leap in reliability by generating two unique fingerprints for each PUF. This “zero-overhead” method uses the same PUF components to make both keys and does not require extra area and latency because of an innovative design feature that also allows their PUF to be about 15 times more energy efficient than previously published versions. “Basically each PUF unit can work in two modes,” said Yang, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering."</em> <a href="http://news.rice.edu/2019/02/20/rice-u-researchers-unveil-internet-of-things-security-feature/">[...]</a>

This is breaking new ground in a field of research that has been hampered by the lack of a universal method to track pollen for over a century. In an article published in the journal Methods in Ecology and Evolution this week, Dr Corneile Minnaar describes this novel method, which will enable pollination biologists to track the whole pollination process from the first visit by a pollinator to its endpoint – either successfully transferred to another flower's stigma or lost along the way. Despite over two hundred years of detailed research on pollination, Minnaar says, researchers do not know for sure where most of the microscopically tiny pollen grains actually land up once they leave flowers: “Plants produce massive amounts of pollen, but it looks like more than 90% of it never reaches stigmas. For the tiny fraction of pollen grains that make their way to stigmas, the journey is often unclear—which pollinators transferred the grains and from where?" Starting in 2015, Minnaar decided to tread where many others have thus far failed, and took up the challenge through his PhD research in the Department of Botany and Zoology at Stellenbosch University (SU)."</em> <a href="https://www.sun.ac.za/english/Lists/news/DispForm.aspx?ID=6231">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scientists at Tokyo Tech, Ricoh co. and The National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology have developed an ultra-low-power atomic clock (ULPAC) for small satellites to enable future communication systems beyond 5G. The proposed device outperforms the current industry standards in various benchmarks, such as size, stability, and power consumption. As current telecommunication technologies continue to evolve, the speed and sheer amount of data required by users worldwide increase accordingly. One promising method for satisfying this ever-growing demand is by deploying a constellation of nano- or micro-scale satellites that circle the planet in low earth orbit. However, such a swarm of satellites requires extremely precise synchronization to a global time standard, for which a very precise atomic clock on board each unit is necessary. Because conventional atomic clocks are too large (155–755 cm3) and consume too much power (up to 10 W) to be employed on small satellites, researchers have developed quantum atomic clocks with greatly reduced size and power consumption by employing a method called coherent population trapping."</em> <a href="https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/news/2019/043524.html">[...]</a>

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is helping the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) institute a similar plan for when commercial wireless providers and the U.S. Navy attempt to share a desirable 150-megahertz (MHz)-wide section of the radio frequency (RF) spectrum for communications. In a new paper, NIST researchers demonstrate that deep learning algorithms—a form of artificial intelligence—are significantly better than a commonly used, less sophisticated method for detecting when offshore radars are operating. Improved radar detection would enable commercial users to know when they must yield the so-called 3.5 Gigahertz (3.5 GHz) Band. In 2015, the FCC adopted rules for the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) to permit commercial LTE (long-term evolution) wireless equipment vendors and service providers to use the 3.5 GHz Band when not needed for radar operations. Companies such as AT&amp;T, Google, Nokia, Qualcomm, Sony and Verizon have been eager to access this band (between 3550 and 3700 MHz) because it will expand product markets and give end users better coverage and higher data rate speeds in a variety of environments where service is traditionally weak."</em> <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2019/02/ai-may-be-better-detecting-radar-signals-facilitating-spectrum-sharing">[...]</a>

Perfect light absorbers — materials that absorb more than 99% of a certain color — can be used for sensing, solar panels, anti-counterfeiting and stealth technologies In the journal Optical Materials Express, researchers from Case Western Reserve University in Ohio report their insights into how colors are generated on heated metal surfaces and apply those findings to create a nickel thin-film that perfectly absorbs red light. “We found that a 3,000-year-old metallurgy technique is actually one of the simplest examples of a metasurface — artificial surfaces with subwavelength features that impart unique electromagnetic properties,” said Giuseppe Strangi, a member of the Case Western Reserve University research team. “Creating color changes by depositing a single metal layer opens up new aesthetic possibilities in metalworking, as well as applications such as shielding devices from electromagnetic signals that cause noise and interference.” Unlike the iridescent colors of water bubbles and butterfly wings, which change depending on the viewing angle, the thin oxide films produced by heating metal maintain their colors at all angles. This could make the heat-induced color useful for making holograms to protect currency and metal products from counterfeiting.

Introduction There are two ways to create an image with a laser — vector scan and raster scan. During vector scanning, the laser moves along the outlines of the image, only turning off while moving from one outline to the next. That means that the laser is on most of the time, making for a rather bright resulting image. That method is most often used in large-scale, industrial laser projectors, but it requires the use of a rather complex electro-mechanical device — the galvanometer — to move the laser quickly.

<p><em>"Wireless Audio is already a technically advanced field where Bluetooth and RF Communications are the main technologies (although most commercial audio equipment works with Bluetooth). Designing a simple IR Audio Link Circuit would not be beneficial when compared to the existing technologies but it surely will be a learning experience about the wireless audio transfer. The reason for not being beneficial is the fact that unlike Bluetooth, IR is line-of-sight communication i.e. both the transmitter and receiver must always face each other without any obstacles. Also, the range may not the as large as that of a typical Bluetooth Wireless Audio. None the less, for the purpose of understanding, let me design a simple IR Audio Link circuit using easily available components."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/IR-Based-Wireless-Audio-Transmitter-and-Receiver/">[...]</a>

There are simple designs: www.instructables.com/id/Easy-Acoustic-Levitator/ www.instructables.com/id/Mini-Acoustic-Levitation/ and there are not quite as simple designs: www.instructables.com/id/Acoustic-Levitator/ In this project I'm aiming for something in-between along with some cool demonstrations. If you just want a quick overview then check out the post on my website. The physics behind acoustic levitation gets a little complicated but the general idea is that if you take a sound wave and reflect it back into itself, this will setup a stationary wave. Somewhere along that wave there will be a condition (or several of them) where the forces are directed towards a single point, and if the acoustic power is high enough, this can overcome gravity and we get stable levitation.
