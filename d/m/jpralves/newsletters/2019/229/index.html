<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1888, [James Waddell Alexander II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Waddell_Alexander_II. Este matemático norte-americano fundou o ramo da matemática originalmente conhecido como análise situs, agora chamado topologia. Em 1912, ingressou na faculdade do departamento de matemática de Princeton. Posteriormente, Alexander generalizou o teorema da curva de Jordan e, em 1928, descobriu o polinómio de Alexander, que é muito usado na teoria dos nós.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou, Linus Torvalds fez o signoff da versão 5.3 do Kernel Linux. Esta versão Major traz vários novos recursos, dezenas de melhorias e drivers atualizados.</p>

<p>Após dois meses de trabalho e oito versões RC (Release Candidate), o kernel final do Linux 5.3 já está disponível, trazendo algumas adições interessantes para melhorar o suporte ao hardware, mas também o desempenho geral. Os destaques desta nova versão de kernel incluem suporte para o Intel Speed Select para facilitar o ajuste de energia em determinados servidores Xeon, suporte para placas gráficas AMD Radeon Navi, como a AMD Radeon RX5700, no driver AMDGPU, suporte para processadores Zhaoxin x86, bem como suporte para o mecanismo de fixação de utilização em CPUs com potência assimétrica. Este novo Kernel também apresenta uma nova chamada de sistema pidfd_open (2) que pretende ajudar os gestores de serviço a lidar com problemas de reutilização de PID, suporte para as instruções umwait x86 para um espaço de utilizador mais eficiente em termos de energia, suporte para o hipervisor ACRN incorporado e suporte de 16 milhões de novos endereços IPv4 no intervalo 0.0.0.0/8.</p>

<p>Também esta semana que passou foi lançada uma nova versão do IDE do Arduino. A versão 1.8.10 visa endereçar problemas que existiam com "screen readers", cache inteligente de ficheiros JSON, Serial Plotter com Legendas nos gráficos, histórico de Comandos no Serial Monitor, entre outras.</p>

<p>Por fim, nesta semana que passou foi disponibilizado o programa de certificação do Wi-fi 6. Esta nova versão agora disponível oferece a melhor experiência ao utilizador com dispositivos baseados no IEEE 802.11ax. Esta nove versão entre outras coisas visa endereçar problemas de segurança identificados nas versões anteriores introduzindo o WPA3, visa igualmente endereçar problemas de saturação quando existem muitos dispositivos ligados em locais como aeroportos, conferencias, etc. Infelizmente só daqui a algum tempo, quando os equipamentos suportarem estas novas normas é que vamos ter estas capacidades. A norma 802.11ax requer suporte no hardware e na maior parte dos casos não vai ser possível apenas com uma actualização de firmware suportar esta nova norma.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. São também apresentadas as revistas newelectronics de 10 de Setembro e a Hackspace Magazine de Setembro.</p>

<p><em>"Linus Torvalds announced today the release of the Linux 5.3 kernel series, a major that brings several new features, dozens of improvements, and updated drivers. Two months in the works and eight RC (Release Candidate) builds later, the final Linux 5.3 kernel is now available, bringing quite some interesting additions to improve hardware support, but also the overall performance. Linux kernel 5.3 had an extra Release Candidate because of Linus Torvalds' travel schedule, but it also brought in a few needed fixes. "Even if the reason for that extra week was my travel schedule rather than any pending issues, we ended up having a few good fixes come in, including some for some bad Btrfs behavior. Yeah, there's some unnecessary noise in there too (like the speling fixes), but we also had several last-minute reverts for things that caused issues," said Linus Torvalds. Here's what's new in Linux kernel 5.3 Highlights of the Linux 5.3 kernel series include support for Intel Speed Select to make power tuning much easier on certain Xeon servers, support for AMD Radeon Navi graphics cards, such as the AMD Radeon RX5700, in the AMDGPU driver, support for Zhaoxin x86 processors, as well as support for the utilization clamping mechanism in power-asymmetric CPUs."</em> <a href="https://news.softpedia.com/news/linux-kernel-5-3-officially-released-here-s-what-s-new-527410.shtml">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Hey Arduiners, Today we are releasing IDE 1.8.10 and you should try it because it’s awesome! With the support of our incredible community, we’ve been improving a lot of (small and not so small) things. Besides taking a look at the complete changelog, we’d like to point out one outstanding contribution that we received during this dev cycle. Our friend Joe Wegner from APH reached out to us with a very clear plan on how to improve the IDE’s accessibility with some very convenient patches. With the help of co-founder Tom Igoe and ITP alumnus and research resident Jim Schmitz, we’ve started targeting some of the most problematic components that used to interact badly with screen readers (popups, links, lists not entirely navigable by keyboard) while also adding a plethora of accessibility descriptions to components that were basically hidden for blind and visually impaired users. To keep things clean, Wegner added a checkbox under Preference panel to enable some particular optimizations for screen readers (like transforming links into buttons so they can be reached using the TAB key)."</em> <a href="https://blog.arduino.cc/2019/09/16/arduino-1-8-10-has-been-released-with-improved-accessibility/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Industry's highest-performing SSDs integrate three key software technologies: 'fail-in-place', 'SSD virtualization' and 'V-NAND machine learning' PM1733 and PM1735 series, offered in 19 models, deliver twice the speed of Gen3 SSDs at up to 8,000MB/s Samsung Electronics, the world leader in advanced memory technology, today announced that it has brought the latest software innovations to the company’s most cutting-edge PCIe Gen4 solid state drive (SSD) series, opening up a new paradigm in SSD performance. “We are combining breakthrough speeds and capacities with revolutionary software solutions as we accelerate expansion in the premium SSD market,” said Kye Hyun Kyung, executive vice president of Memory Solution Product &amp; Development at Samsung Electronics. “We plan to introduce additional innovation led by our most advanced (sixth-generation) V-NAND in helping to trigger a lot more growth in the global IT market.” 3 Software Innovations Create New Paradigm for Ultra-High-Capacity Datacenter SSDs The three software innovations include: 1) ‘fail-in-place (FIP) technology’ that ensures a ‘never-die’ SSD, 2) ‘virtualization technology’ that provides independent virtual workspaces for multiple users, and 3) ‘V-NAND machine learning technology’ that utilizes big data to accurately verify data validity even when operating at ultra-high speeds. Samsung’s FIP technology marks a new milestone in the 60-year history of storage by ensuring that SSDs maintain normal operation even when errors occur at the chip level, enabling a never-dying SSD for the first time in the industry. In the past, failure in just one out of several hundred NAND chips meant having to replace an entire SSD, causing system downtime and additional drive replacement cost. SSDs integrated with Samsung’s FIP software can detect a faulty chip, scan for any damage in data, then relocate the data into working chips."</em> <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-brings-revolutionary-software-innovation-to-pcie-gen4-ssds-for-maximized-storage-performance">[...]</a>

<p><em>"8-pin STM32G0 devices combine performance, compactness, flexibility, and power efficiency STM32 microcontrollers (MCU) from STMicroelectronics are now available in an 8-pin package, enabling simple embedded projects to leverage 32-bit performance and flexibility in a compact and cost-effective outline. STMicroelectronics Brings 32-Bit-MCU Possibilities&amp;nbsp;to Simple Applications with First 8-Pin STM32 Microcontrollers The four new STM32G0 devices deliver a unique combination of 8-pin economy with a 64MHz Arm® Cortex®-M0+ CPU giving 59 DMIPS, up to 8Kbyte RAM and 32Kbyte Flash on-chip, and high-performing peripherals including a 2.5Msps ADC, high-resolution timer, and a high-speed SPI. With flexible mapping of I/O pins and internal MCU functions, designers can upgrade end-product functionality without trading board real-estate or bill-of-materials costs. The stability of the internal oscillator, which is accurate to ±1% over wide temperature and voltage ranges, also saves external clock components. Benefiting from the proven low-power design features of the STM32 MCU family, the 8-pin STM32G0 devices are ready to take over in energy-conscious applications governed by battery-capacity limits, eco-design legislation, or market expectations such as appliance energy ratings. The new MCUs also ease future scalability through the features available across the STM32G0 series, which offers up to 100 package pins, up to 512Kbytes Flash, additional high-performance analog peripherals, and cyber-protection features."</em> <a href="https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/about/media-center/press-item.html/n4188.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Made from carbon nanotubes, the new coating is 10 times darker than other very black materials. With apologies to “Spinal Tap,” it appears that black can, indeed, get more black. MIT engineers report today that they have cooked up a material that is 10 times blacker than anything that has previously been reported. The material is made from vertically aligned carbon nanotubes, or CNTs — microscopic filaments of carbon, like a fuzzy forest of tiny trees, that the team grew on a surface of chlorine-etched aluminum foil. The foil captures at least 99.995 percent* of any incoming light, making it the blackest material on record.

<p><em>"A cheap, thermoelectric device that harnesses the cold of space to generate electricity has been reported by international researchers who used the device to power a LED. The researchers developed the device by taking advantage of radiative cooling, where a sky-facing surface passes its heat into the atmosphere, losing some heat to space and reaching a cooler temperature than the surrounding air. While the energy it produces is relatively small, researchers say it could be used to generate power in remote locations, especially at night, and eventually be improved over time for more widespread use. No word yet whether we can also harness the cold darkness in our hearts, though. Device generates light from the cold night sky An inexpensive thermoelectric device harnesses the cold of space without active heat input, generating electricity that powers an LED at night, researchers report September 12 in the journal Joule. "Remarkably, the device is able to generate electricity at night, when solar cells don't work," says lead author Aaswath Raman (@aaraman), an assistant professor of materials science and engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles."</em> <a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/device-generates-light-using-the-cold-night-sky">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/new-metamaterial-morphs-new-shapes-taking-new-properties">New Metamaterial Morphs Into New Shapes, Taking on New Properties</a></h2>

<p><em>"A newly developed type of architected metamaterial has the ability to change shape in a tunable fashion. While most reconfigurable materials can toggle between two distinct states, the way a switch toggles on or off, the new material's shape can be finely tuned, adjusting its physical properties as desired. The material, which has potential applications in next-generation energy storage and bio-implantable micro-devices, was developed by a joint Caltech-Georgia Tech-ETH Zurich team in the lab of Julia R. Greer. Greer, the Ruben F. and Donna Mettler Professor of Materials Science, Mechanics and Medical Engineering in Caltech's Division of Engineering and Applied Science, creates materials out of micro- and nanoscale building blocks that are arranged into sophisticated architectures that can be periodic, like a lattice, or non-periodic in a tailor-made fashion, giving them unusual physical properties. Most materials that are designed to change shape require a persistent external stimulus to change from one shape to another and stay that way: for example, they may be one shape when wet and a different shape when dry—like a sponge that swells as it absorbs water. By contrast, the new nanomaterial deforms through an electrochemically driven silicon-lithium alloying reaction, meaning that it can be finely controlled to attain any “in-between” states, remain in these configurations even upon the removal of the stimulus, and be easily reversed."</em> <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/new-metamaterial-morphs-new-shapes-taking-new-properties">[...]</a>

<p><em>"When the world’s newest telescope starts imaging the southern sky in 2023, it will take photos using optical assemblies designed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) researchers and built by Lab industrial partners. A key feature of the camera’s optical assemblies for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), under construction in northern Chile, will be its three lenses, one of which at 1.57 meters (5.1 feet) in diameter is believed to be the world’s largest high-performance optical lens ever fabricated. The lens assembly, which includes the lens dubbed L-1, and its smaller companion lens (L-2), at 1.2 meters in diameter, was built over the past five years by Boulder, Colorado-based Ball Aerospace and its subcontractor, Tucson-based Arizona Optical Systems. Mounted together in a carbon fiber structure, the two lenses were shipped from Tucson, arriving intact after a 17-hour truck journey at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in Menlo Park. SLAC is managing the overall design and fabrication, as well as the subcomponent integration and final assembly of LSST’s $168 million, 3,200-megapixel digital camera, which is more than 90 percent complete and due to be finished by early 2021. In addition to SLAC and LLNL, the team building the camera includes an international collaboration of universities and labs, including the Paris-based Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique and Brookhaven National Laboratory."</em> <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/news/world%E2%80%99s-largest-optical-lens-shipped-slac">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Physicists find evidence for the mechanism by which metals may exhibit 'ferroelectricity' One of the most fundamental rules physics students learn in college is that metals cannot possess an internal electric field. This makes metals, in a sense, opposite to "ferroelectrics," which are materials that spontaneously create their own electric fields. However, for nearly 50 years, scientists have wondered if perhaps a metal could act unlike itself and display ferroelectric-like behavior. In 2013, one such candidate, called lithium osmate, or LiOsO3, was discovered. Now, Caltech researchers have uncovered details of the mechanism by which LiOsO3 acts in ferroelectric ways, a finding that may have implications for the design of new metals in the future for use in computers and other devices. "It's hard to predict at this stage what this type of material would be used for, but we are on the cutting edge of researching these metals with entirely new properties," says Nick Laurita, a postdoctoral scholar in physics and lead author of a new paper that appeared July 19 in the journal Nature Communications."</em> <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/metal-unlike-itself">[...]</a>

However, the change from smaller coin-sized cells to bigger “pouch” cells has posed challenges to battery manufacturers, because scaling up the manufacturing processes can lead to high costs and unstable product quality. A key part of the manufacturing line is the adding of electrolyte, which permeates and fills the pores in the electrode.

<p><em>"This instructable shows a reciprocal frequency counter capable of measuring frequencies fast and with reasonable precision. It is made with standard components and can be made in a weekend (it took me a bit longer :-) ) The old school way to measure the frequency of a signal is to use a logic AND-gate, feed the signal to be measured into one port and a signal with an exactly 1 second high time to the other port and count the output. This works quite well for signals of a few kHz well into the GHz. But what if you want to measure a low frequency signal with good resolution? Say you want to measure the frequency of mains (here 50 Hz). With the old school method you will see a constant 50 on your display if you are lucky, but more likely you will see the display switch from 49 to 50 or 50 to 51."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/High-Resolution-Frequency-Counter/">[...]</a>

It is essentially a basic voltmeter (fitted with transducers to convert sound to voltage) that takes a simple average of the signal and displays it with an attack and release time of around 300 ms. It was originally designed as a kind of loudness meter, rather than as a peak meter, but it is generally used in audio recording to help make sure you’re recording at appropriate levels.

<p><em>"An Intuitive and Compact HID for the Braille Education of the Visually Impaired. An educational device created in response to the decline of Braille literacy rates among the visually impaired. An intuitive HID that allows the visually impaired to easily interact with computers The Problem Literacy in the Braille system is crucial to the employment of the visually impaired. According to the National Federation of the Blind, 80 percent of the visually impaired who are employed can read Braille. However, in recent years, the Braille literacy rates has been on the decline. Today, less than 10 percent of the visually impaired children can read Braille, where as the number was about 50 percent in 1950."</em> <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/166947-knobo">[...]</a>

<p><em>"An Arduino Mega is used to control a large (40 inch x 20 inch) color LED display with scrolling text. Software is provided for demos. After seeing the large number of views my recent project (Servo Motor Art) got, I decided I probably should share some of my other Arduino based projects. The one I am presenting here is a flat panel LED display that is quite easy to build (although not particularly inexpensive). The main challenges in this project is developing the software, but I am providing a whole bunch of it that I have been developing over the past few years. The nice thing about this project is that you can do so many things with it once it's built."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/doug-domke/128-x-64-led-flat-panel-display-caa4d3">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.electronics-lab.com/project/differential-microphone-pre-amplifier/">Differential Microphone Pre-Amplifier</a></h2>

<p><em>"The project shown here is a microphone preamplifier that provides high quality amplification, optimized for use in computers, media and mobile applications. The pre-amplifier provides a differential input stage, making the device particularly effective when layout constraints force the microphone amplifier to be physically remote from the ECM microphone. This project features adjustable gain using PR1 trimmer potentiometer, very high power-supply rejection (95dB), and common-mode rejection (79dB), making it ideal for low-noise applications. Board is provided with condenser microphone as well as connector to connect external microphone, selection of external or internal microphone is possible with the help of on board Jumper. Circuit requires 5V DC input. The circuit provides differential output, use +OP/GND for single ended output."</em> <a href="http://www.electronics-lab.com/project/differential-microphone-pre-amplifier/">[...]</a>
