<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1694, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltaire">Francois Marie Arouet Voltaire</a>. Este filosofo francês foi o autor que popularizou a obra de Isaac Newton na França, organizando uma tradução de Principia Mathematica à qual ele adicionou seu próprio comentário (1737). O trabalho da tradução foi feito pela marquesa de Châtelet, mas o comentário de Voltaire preencheu a lacuna entre os não-cientistas e as ideias de Newton numa época em que na França as visões pré-newtonianas de Descartes ainda eram predominantes. Embora filósofo, Voltaire defendia a análise racional.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1824, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieronymous_Theodor_Richter">Hieronymous Theodor Richter</a>. Este Mineralogista alemão em 1863 foi co-descobridor do elemento índio. Ele era assistente de Ferdinand Reich, que suspeitava que um novo elemento estivesse presente nas amostras de minério de zinco que ele processara quimicamente. Reich era cego em cores e entregou o trabalho de fazer uma análise espectroscópica a seu assistente. Quando Richter colocou parte da amostra num laço de arame de platina e a aqueceu na chama de um bico de Bunsen, ele observou uma linha brilhante de índigo característica disso como um novo elemento - chamado índio devido a cor dessa linha. Após a separação do óxido hidratado de índio, eles o reduziram para obter uma amostra do novo metal.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou o primeiro protótipo de nave espacial em tamanho real da SpaceX sofreu uma anomalia no teste de pressão. A Starship Mk1, de aço inoxidável, sofreu uma anomalia durante um teste de pressão criogénica na passada quarta-feira (20 de novembro) nas instalações da SpaceX, perto da vila de Boca Chica, no sul do Texas. De acordo com representantes da companhia "o objectivo do teste de hoje foi pressionar os sistemas ao máximo, pelo que o resultado não fosse completamente inesperado. Não houve feridos, nem é um sério revés".</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. É apresentado também o livro "Get Started With Arduino" e a revista Hackspace Magazine nº 25 de Dezembro.</p>

<p><em>"The stainless-steel Starship Mk1 experienced an anomaly during a cryogenic pressure test Wednesday (Nov. 20) at SpaceX's facilities near the South Texas village of Boca Chica. The Mk1's test campaign began just yesterday (Nov. 19), when the vehicle "breathed" during its first-ever pressure test. SpaceX will now focus on developing more advanced prototypes rather than repair and retest the Mk1, company founder and CEO Elon Musk suggested via Twitter this afternoon. "Absolutely, but to move to Mk3 design. This had some value as a manufacturing pathfinder, but flight design is quite different," Musk wrote. He was responding to a tweet by "Everyday Astronaut" Tim Dodd, who opined that SpaceX might end up transitioning to the Mk2 or Mk3, and then asked Musk directly if the company plans to "just move on to Mk3.""</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-starship-prototype-anomaly-pressure-test.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Industry’s first 4Mbit EEPROM in small, low-cost, 8-pin package Data-storage boost brings more features and precision to smart devices ST is the world leader in serial EEPROM memories, widely used across a full range of applications Geneva / 21 Nov 2019 STMicroelectronics (NYSE: STM) , a global semiconductor leader serving customers across the spectrum of electronics applications, has introduced a new generation of memory chips that combine unprecedented storage density with speed and reliability, enabling the devices we use every day to do more to enrich life and work. With 4Mbit capacity, ST’s new EEPROM memories let small devices capture and store more data through the serial SPI bus. This enables equipment such as smart meters to intensify data logging for managing grids more effectively and providing more user-friendly billing. Also, portable medical devices can log patients’ data more intensively to improve care quality, and consumer devices such as smart wearables can support more user features and greater precision. In these applications, the memory’s low power consumption helps extend battery runtime. A wide range of applications in industrial controls and communication infrastructure such as network switches can also benefit from these higher density memories."</em> <a href="https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/about/media-center/press-item.html/p4211.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"News Highlights: Intel launches oneAPI, a unified and scalable programming model to harness the power of diverse computing architectures in the era of HPC/AI convergence. Intel introduces a general-purpose GPU optimized for HPC/AI acceleration based on the Xe architecture, code-named “Ponte Vecchio.” Intel unveils additional architectural details of the Aurora Supercomputer, delivering convergence at exascale at Argonne National Laboratory. DENVER, Nov. 17, 2019 – At Supercomputing 2019, Intel unveiled its vision for extending its leadership in the convergence of high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) with new additions to its data-centric silicon portfolio and an ambitious new software initiative that represents a paradigm shift from today’s single-architecture, single-vendor programming models. Addressing the increasing use of heterogeneous architectures in high-performance computing, Intel expanded on its existing technology portfolio to move, store and process data more effectively by announcing a new category of discrete general-purpose GPUs optimized for AI and HPC convergence. Intel also launched the oneAPI industry initiative to deliver a unified and simplified programming model for application development across heterogenous processing architectures, including CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs and other accelerators. The launch of oneAPI represents millions of Intel engineering hours in software development and marks a game-changing evolution from today’s limiting, proprietary programming approaches to an open standards-based model for cross-architecture developer engagement and innovation."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/intel-unveils-new-gpu-architecture-optimized-for-hpc-ai-oneapi/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scientists from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore) in a collaboration with the University of Groningen (UG) in the Netherlands, have developed a method to analyse which pairs of materials in next-generation perovskite solar cells will harvest the most energy. In a paper published in Science Advances this week, physicists Professor Sum Tze Chien from NTU and Professor Maxim Pshenichnikov from UG used extremely fast lasers to observe how an energy barrier forms when perovskite is joined with a material that extracts the electrical charges to make a solar cell. Conventionally, a solar cell absorbs sunlight and converts it to electrical charge. During this process, the light particles have more energy than needed to generate the electrical charges in the solar cells. This excess energy gives rise to what are called “hot” charges, which lose their excess energy very fast as heat (within one picosecond), leaving only “cold” charges available for electrical power generation. This energy loss is why conventional solar cells have a theoretical limit of 33 per cent for power conversion efficiency."</em> <a href="http://news.ntu.edu.sg/pages/newsdetail.aspx?URL=http://news.ntu.edu.sg/news/Pages/NR2019_Nov16.aspx&amp;Guid=afe889b9-644e-499a-b1a1-23273793f060&amp;Category=All">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Catalysts accelerate chemical reactions, but the widely used metal platinum is scarce and expensive. Researchers at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), together with Chinese, Singaporean and Japanese researchers, have now developed an alternative with a 20x higher activity: a catalyst with hollow nanocages of an alloy of nickel and platinum. TU/e researcher Emiel Hensen wants to use this new catalyst to develop a refrigerator-size electrolyzer of about 10 megawatts in the future. The results have been published in the journal Science. By 2050, the Dutch government aims to get almost all of the national energy requirements from sustainable sources, such as the sun or the wind. Because these energy sources are not available at all times, it is important to be able to store the generated energy."</em> <a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/news/news-overview/storing-energy-in-hydrogen-20-times-more-effective-using-platinum-nickel-catalyst/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/804372">Graphene: The more you bend it, the softer it gets</a></h2>

<p><em>"New research by engineers at the University of Illinois combines atomic-scale experimentation with computer modeling to determine how much energy it takes to bend multilayer graphene – a question that has eluded scientists since graphene was first isolated. The findings are reported in the journal Nature Materials. Graphene – a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a lattice – is the strongest material in the world and so thin that it is flexible, the researchers said. It is considered one of the key ingredients of future technologies. Most of the current research on graphene targets the development of nanoscale electronic devices. Yet, researchers say that many technologies – from stretchable electronics to tiny robots so small that they cannot be seen with the naked eye – require an understanding of the mechanics of graphene, particularly how it flexes and bends, to unlock their potential."</em> <a href="https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/804372">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Most security applications, for instance access to buildings or digital signatures, use cryptographic keys that must at all costs be kept secret. That also is the weak link: who will guarantee that the key doesn’t get stolen or hacked? Using a physical unclonable key (PUK) – which can be a stroke of white paint on a surface – and the quantum properties of light, researchers of the University of Twente and Eindhoven University of Technology present a new type of data security that does away with secret keys. They present their method in the journal Quantum Science &amp; Technology. Information security, in online banking for example, often works with a combination of a public key and a private key. The public key is known to everyone, but for creating a digital signature, a private key is necessary."</em> <a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/news/news-overview/cryptography-without-secret-keys/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"MIT-Italy helps build supercharged partnerships on campus and across the globe. “He was here to dream, and I said 'OK, let's dream together,'” recalls Professor Mircea Dincă of his first encounter with Automobili Lamborghini Head of Development Riccardo Parenti in February 2017. Two years later, the team is celebrating its first major collaborative victory by filing a joint patent. The new patented material was synthesized by Dincă’s lab in the Department of Chemistry, with the support of Automobili Lamborghini’s Concept Development Department, and will serve as the technological base for a new generation of supercapacitors. By increasing the surface area exposed to electric charge in relation to mass and volume, the patent promises to increase energy density by up to 100 percent when compared to existing technology. This is a big leap, even when compared to Lamborghini’s cutting-edge supercapacitors, and, more broadly, a game-changer in high-performance motor sport."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/lamborghini-mit-pave-way-electric-supercar-future-1119">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Multinozzle printer can switch between multiple inks up to 50 times per second 3D printers are revolutionizing manufacturing by allowing users to create any physical shape they can imagine on-demand. However, most commercial printers are only able to build objects from a single material at a time and inkjet printers that are capable of multimaterial printing are constrained by the physics of droplet formation. Extrusion-based 3D printing allows a broad palette of materials to be printed, but the process is extremely slow. For example, it would take roughly 10 days to build a 3D object roughly one liter in volume at the resolution of a human hair and print speed of 10 cm/s using a single-nozzle, single-material printhead. To build the same object in less than 1 day, one would need to implement a printhead with 16 nozzles printing simultaneously! Now, a new technique called multimaterial multinozzle 3D (MM3D) printing developed at Harvard’s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering and John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) uses high-speed pressure valves to achieve rapid, continuous, and seamless switching between up to eight different printing materials, enabling the creation of complex shapes in a fraction of the time currently required using printheads that range from a single nozzle to large multinozzle arrays."</em> <a href="https://wyss.harvard.edu/news/multimaterial-3d-printing-manufactures-complex-objects-fast/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"An international study led from Lund University in Sweden shows that 30 per cent of the energy in a certain type of light-absorbing iron molecule disappears in a previously unknown manner. By closing this loophole, the researchers hope to contribute to the development of more efficient solar cells using this iron-based solar cell. The sun is an unlimited source of pure and renewable energy. However, manufacturing the components in today’s silicon-based solar cell solutions requires a lot of energy, and many new solar celluse rare or toxic elements. Researchers at Lund University have therefore started to develop alternative solar cell solutions based on iron. As a part of this research, an international research team recently carried out a free electron laser experiment at Stanford in the US to investigate how light-absorbing iron molecules transfer electrons into a state from which the energy can be extracted."</em> <a href="https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/article/iron-based-solar-cells-on-track-to-becoming-more-efficient">[...]</a>

The study of pyrite-type materials provides new insights and opportunities for selective spin control in topological spintronics devices. SEEKING NEW SPIN IN TOPOLOGICAL MATERIALS Topological materials have exciting potential for next-generation, ultra-low energy electronics, including thermoelectric and spintronic devices. However, a restriction on the use of such materials in spintronics has been that all topological materials studied thus far have spin states that lie parallel to the plane of the material, while many/most/all practical spintronic devices would require out-of-plane spin states. Generating and manipulating out-of-plane spins without applying an external electric or magnetic field has been a key challenge in spintronics.

In a paper published today in Nature Communications, UNSW chemical engineers shone a light on the mysterious world of liquid metals and their role as catalysts to speed up chemical processes using low amounts of energy. Professor Kourosh Kalantar-Zadeh of UNSW’s School of Chemical Engineering says that “anyone with a shaker and a cooktop at home in their kitchen can make catalysts that can be used for CO2 conversion, cleaning water and other pollutants. “They can do this by using a combination of liquid metals like gallium, indium, bismuth and tin in alloys that can be melted under 300oC on a cooktop or in an oven.” Professor Kalantar-Zadeh and colleague Dr Jianbo Tang showed that by heating an alloy of bismuth and tin, the metal melted at a point much lower than if you were to heat each metal individually.

<p><em>"New blueprint for affordable, sustainable ‘flow batteries’ developed at Berkeley Lab could accelerate an electrical grid powered by the sun and wind How do you store renewable energy so it’s there when you need it, even when the sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing? Giant batteries designed for the electrical grid – called flow batteries, which store electricity in tanks of liquid electrolyte – could be the answer, but so far utilities have yet to find a cost-effective battery that can reliably power thousands of homes throughout a lifecycle of 10 to 20 years. Now, a battery membrane technology developed by researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) may point to a solution. As reported in the journal Joule, the researchers developed a versatile yet affordable battery membrane – from a class of polymers known as AquaPIMs. This class of polymers makes long-lasting and low-cost grid batteries possible based solely on readily available materials such as zinc, iron, and water. The team also developed a simple model showing how different battery membranes impact the lifetime of the battery, which is expected to accelerate early stage R&amp;D for flow-battery technologies, particularly in the search for a suitable membrane for different battery chemistries."</em> <a href="https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2019/11/07/grid-battery-for-renewable-energy/">[...]</a>

In today’s factories and warehouses, it’s not uncommon to see robots whizzing about, shuttling items or tools from one station to another. For the most part, robots navigate pretty easily across open layouts. But they have a much harder time winding through narrow spaces to carry out tasks such as reaching for a product at the back of a cluttered shelf, or snaking around a car’s engine parts to unscrew an oil cap. Now MIT engineers have developed a robot designed to extend a chain-like appendage flexible enough to twist and turn in any necessary configuration, yet rigid enough to support heavy loads or apply torque to assemble parts in tight spaces. When the task is complete, the robot can retract the appendage and extend it again, at a different length and shape, to suit the next task."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/robot-grow-like-plant-1107">[...]</a>

While significant progress has been made on volumetric capture systems, focusing on 3D geometric reconstruction with high resolution textures, much less work has been done to recover photometric properties needed for relighting. Results from such systems lack high-frequency details and the subject's shading is prebaked into the texture. In contrast, a large body of work has addressed relightable acquisition for image-based approaches, which photograph the subject under a set of basis lighting conditions and recombine the images to show the subject as they would appear in a target lighting environment. However, to date, these approaches have not been adapted for use in the context of a high-resolution volumetric capture system. Our method combines this ability to realistically relight humans for arbitrary environments, with the benefits of free-viewpoint volumetric capture and new levels of geometric accuracy for dynamic performances."</em> <a href="https://augmentedperception.github.io/therelightables/">[...]</a>

So with this sensor you can control a robotic hand, or you can use your muscles to control anything. Using our muscles to control things is the way that most of us are accustomed to doing it. We push buttons, pull levers, move joysticks... but what if we could take the buttons, levers and joysticks out of the equation? This is the MyoWare Muscle Sensor, an Arduino-powered, all-in-one electromyography (EMG) sensor The MyoWare board acts by measuring the filtered and rectified electrical activity of a muscle; outputting 0-Vs Volts depending the amount of activity in the selected muscle, where Vs signifies the voltage of the power source."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/mertarduino/how-to-use-emg-muscle-sensor-ff5477">[...]</a>

<p><em>"We make a NeoPixel light installations using Fishino and NodeMCU, controlled via Wi-Fi from PC or Raspberry Pi through a Python library. A few years ago, the American Adafruit Industries revolutionized the LED market by introducing its NeoPixels, whose main feature is to integrate, in a single package, an RGB LED and its controller. Adafruit’s goal was to meet the Arduino world by simplifying the LEDs management, integrating both the controller and the RGB LEDs in the same package. Since then, NeoPixels have spread widely among the public, mainly because, in addition to integrating the controller, they can be cascaded and addressed individually, controlling the color and brightness one by one. Inside each NeoPixel LED there is an RGB SMD LED (usually a 5050 and an integrated WS2811 or WS2812, that acts as a driver. A microcontroller (e.g., Arduino) sends an array of bytes with a precise timing through all the LEDs connected in series and makes it possible to create colorful and bright animations."</em> <a href="https://www.open-electronics.org/how-to-control-neopixel-strip-with-wifi/">[...]</a>

However, due to the complexity of electrical and signal processing requirements, it remains very challenging to create interface prototypes with custom-designed multi-touch input surfaces. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Touch Kit, a technique enabling electronics novices to rapidly prototype customized capacitive multi-touch sensors. In contrast to existing techniques, it works with a commodity microcontroller and open-source software and does not require any specialized hardware. Evaluation results show that our approach enables multi-touch sensors that have a high spatial and temporal resolution, and can accurately detect multiple simultaneous touches. A set of application examples demonstrate the versatile uses of our approach for sensors of different scales, curvature, and materials."</em> <a href="https://hci.cs.uni-saarland.de/multi-touch-kit/">[...]</a>

The Instructable/Hackaday try their best to explain how to make the radio, but I suspect they're written by engineers who aren't too comfortable in English. Details are very sparse - especially when it comes to flashing the ESP. It's a great project though, and all credit goes to those who created it. Many of the posts on Ka-Radio's Facebook page are in Russian - often by people who have already made the device and want to show off the fancy case they've constructed."</em> <a href="http://www.whatimade.today/make-an-amazing-6-digital-radio-with-an-old-esp8266-and-a-vs1053-decoder/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"When using microcontroller for embroidery circuit projects, sometimes you do not want to directly solder them on the embroidery as you need to take it out to change the program on it. For this, sockets are convenient, but it is also bulky on the fabric. I used 5mm felt, that is as thick as the DIP socket to embed the socket inside and extend the socket connection to conductive thread for embroidery. It is still a bit thick, but better than having bare socket on embroidered fabric surface. these sockets does not hold the IC well and sometimes IC falls as you use the fabric as garment… I will need to fasten the IC by embroidering over it after the final program is on it. Cut the felt, make a hole in the middle as big as the IC socket."</em> <a href="http://www.kobakant.at/DIY/?p=7963">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Using a BeagleBone Black, you can create a custom smart mirror to keep you up to date and on track in the mornings when getting ready. Story This project consists of a reflective pane of acrylic with a monitor behind it, creating a mirror that can display useful widgets like the date, the weather, and a daily fortune, among other things. It is a sleek device useful for quickly gathering daily information while, for instance, getting dressed or brushing teeth. Building the Mirror Enclosure Once all supplies are purchased, we can start to determine dimensions and design of the frame itself. For our project, we used a mirror that was 1ft by 2ft in size, while this is not very large, we felt like it was a good start. The frame itself actually measures 18.5" by 30.5" on the outermost dimensions."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/mprocter12/smart-mirror-using-beaglebone-black-e379a3">[...]</a>

In order to see from the image to start the alarm, you must put the correct magnetic card on the RC522 Card Reader.

I was catching up on the Amp Hour podcast and in one of the episodes Dave Jones mentioned something that really caught my attention: bring your projects to social events. I thought about it for a bit but could not think of any good way of bringing large, partially completed projects or populated boards to an event without looking like the ultimate king-of-the-nerds. Of course, I mulled about the idea some more and thought: would it even fit in my pocket?

A capacity measurement device can solve the problem of spotting fake batteries as well. Nowadays fake Lithium and NiMH batteries are everywhere which don’t handle their advertised capacities. Sometimes it is difficult to distinguish between a real and a fake battery. This problem exists in the spare batteries market, such as cell phone batteries.
