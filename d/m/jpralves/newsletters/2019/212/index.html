<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1779, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Moody_(inventor)">Paul Moody</a>. Este inventor e mecânico de máquinas têxteis norte-americano, colaborou com Francis Cabot Lowell, o principal fundador de uma fábrica têxtil da Boston Manufacturing Company em Waltham, Massachusetts. Moody supervisionou as operações da fábrica, mas também trabalhou com a Lowell para desenvolver um tear eléctrico eficiente, o primeiro construído nos EUA (1814), o aparato de fiação “fuso morto” e outras inovações. Em 1823, tornou-se investidor e começou a trabalhar na recém-fundada Merrimack Company, em Lowell, Massacusetts, para fabricar chita. Contribuindo com um número substancial de melhorias patenteadas em máquinas têxteis, ele foi importante no desenvolvimento da indústria têxtil na Nova Inglaterra.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1908, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bardeen">John Bardeen</a>. Este físico norte-americano  recebeu o Prémio Nobel de Física em 1956 e 1972. Ele partilhou o prémio de 1956 com William B. Shockley e Walter H. Brattain pela sua invenção conjunta do transístor. Com Leon N. Cooper e John R. Schrieffer, ele recebeu o prémio de 1972 pelo desenvolvimento da teoria dos super-condutores, geralmente chamada de teoria BCS.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1917, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton_Lorenz">Edward Norton Lorenz</a>. Este matemático e meteorologista norte-americano ficou conhecido por apontar o "efeito borboleta", segundo o qual a teoria do caos prevê que "estados iniciais levemente diferentes podem evoluir para estados consideravelmente diferentes". No seu artigo de 1963 no Journal of Atmospheric Sciences, ele citou o bater de asas de uma gaivota, como capaz de mudar o estado da atmosfera, mesmo de maneira tão trivial, pode resultar em enormes mudanças no resultado dos padrões climáticos. Assim, a previsão meteorológica de longo alcance torna-se quase impossível. Ele determinou esse resultado inesperado em 1961 enquanto executava uma simulação de computador do clima que dava resultados completamente diferentes com pequenas alterações nos dados de entrada.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1934, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Moog">Robert Moog</a>. Este engenheiro e inventor norte-americano deu um avançou na música electrónica com seu sintetizador Moog. A sua paixão pela construção de circuitos electrónicos começou na sua juventude e, aos 14 anos, ele construiu um theremin. Enquanto pós-graduado, Moog desenvolveu o seu primeiro sintetizador electrónico analógico, completo com rodas de controle para criar um amplo espectro de modificações de formas de onda sonoras geradas a partir de circuitos electrónicos de osciladores. Na década de 1960, ele tinha um modelo portátil, o Minimoog, que fornecia a muitos grupos de rock sons distintos. Em 1968, Walter (mais tarde Wendy) Carlos ganhou um Grammy por Switched on Bach, com todas as faixas de instrumento tocadas inteiramente num sintetizador Moog.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou a NASA anunciou que vai voltar à Lua. Numa das primeiras etapas dos planos de exploração lunar da agência Artemis, a NASA anunciou na quinta-feira a selecção da Maxar Technologies, anteriormente SSL, em Westminster, Colorado, para desenvolver e demonstrar recursos de potência, propulsão e comunicações para o portal lunar da NASA. Encarregados de voltar à Lua dentro de cinco anos, os planos de exploração lunar da NASA baseiam-se numa abordagem em duas fases: a primeira está focada na velocidade - aterrar na Lua em 2024 - enquanto a segunda estabelecerá uma presença humana sustentada Lua até 2028. O que aprendermos com esta missão será usado para nos prepararmos para enviar astronautas a Marte.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. É apresentada a revista Hackspace Magazine nº19 de Junho.</p>

<p><em>"In one of the first steps of the agency’s Artemis lunar exploration plans, NASA announced on Thursday the selection of Maxar Technologies, formerly SSL, in Westminster, Colorado, to develop and demonstrate power, propulsion and communications capabilities for NASA’s lunar Gateway. “The power and propulsion element is the foundation of Gateway and a fine example of how partnerships with U.S. companies can help expedite NASA’s return to the Moon with the first woman and next man by 2024,” said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. “It will be the key component upon which we will build our lunar Gateway outpost, the cornerstone of NASA’s sustainable and reusable Artemis exploration architecture on and around the Moon.” The power and propulsion element is a high-power, 50-kilowatt solar electric propulsion spacecraft – three times more powerful than current capabilities. As a mobile command and service module, the Gateway provides a communications relay for human and robotic expeditions to the lunar surface, starting at the Moon’s South Pole. This firm-fixed price award includes an indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity portion and carries a maximum total value of $375 million. The contract begins with a 12-month base period of performance and is followed by a 26-month option, a 14-month option and two 12-month options."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-awards-artemis-contract-for-lunar-gateway-power-propulsion">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The U.S. Postal Service on Tuesday started a two-week test transporting mail across three Southwestern states using self-driving trucks, a step forward in the effort to commercialize autonomous vehicle technology for hauling freight. San Diego-based startup TuSimple said its self-driving trucks will begin hauling mail between USPS facilities in Phoenix and Dallas to see how the nascent technology might improve delivery times and costs. A safety driver will sit behind the wheel to intervene if necessary and an engineer will ride in the passenger seat. If successful, it would mark an achievement for the autonomous driving industry and a possible solution to the driver shortage and regulatory constraints faced by freight haulers across the country. The pilot program involves five round trips, each totaling more than 2,100 miles (3,380 km) or around 45 hours of driving."</em> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tusimple-autonomous-usps/self-driving-trucks-begin-mail-delivery-test-for-u-s-postal-service-idUSKCN1SR0YB">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers from Carnegie Mellon University’s Department of Chemistry have found a way to control the lifetime of the quantum states of gold nanoclusters by three orders of magnitude, which could lead to improvements in solar cell and photocatalysis technologies. Their study is published in the April 18 issue of Science. Excited quantum states occur when light is absorbed by a particle and the energy from that light is temporarily stored within the particle, making its energy higher than its ground state. The energy decays quickly and can be lost as heat in the span of a nanosecond, or one billionth of a second. Extending this quantum state could provide researchers with more time and opportunity to harness the stored energy.

<p><em>"Recyclable plastics that contain ring-shaped polymers may be a key to developing sustainable synthetic materials. Despite some promising advances, researchers said, a full understanding of how to processes ring polymers into practical materials remains elusive. In a new study, researchers identified a mechanism called “threading” that takes place when a polymer is stretched – a behavior not witnessed before. This new insight may lead to new processing methods for sustainable polymer materials. Most consumer plastics are blends of linear polymers. The concept of plastics made purely from ring polymers – molecules that form a closed ring – presents an enticing opportunity for sustainability, as shown by the Autonomous Materials Systems group at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology."</em> <a href="https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/787928">[...]</a>

<p><em>"New method could be useful for building quantum sensors and computers. The ultimate degree of control for engineering would be the ability to create and manipulate materials at the most basic level, fabricating devices atom by atom with precise control. Now, scientists at MIT, the University of Vienna, and several other institutions have taken a step in that direction, developing a method that can reposition atoms with a highly focused electron beam and control their exact location and bonding orientation. The finding could ultimately lead to new ways of making quantum computing devices or sensors, and usher in a new age of “atomic engineering,” they say. The advance is described today in the journal Science Advances, in a paper by MIT professor of nuclear science and engineering Ju Li, graduate student Cong Su, Professor Toma Susi of the University of Vienna, and 13 others at MIT, the University of Vienna, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and in China, Ecuador, and Denmark. “We’re using a lot of the tools of nanotechnology,” explains Li, who holds a joint appointment in materials science and engineering."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/manipulate-atoms-graphene-quantum-0517">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Drawing design inspiration from the skin of stealthy sea creatures, engineers at the University of California, Irvine have developed a next-generation, adaptive space blanket that gives users the ability to control their temperature. The innovation is detailed in a study published today in Nature Communications. “Ultra-lightweight space blankets have been around for decades — you see marathon runners wrapping themselves in them to prevent the loss of body heat after a race — but the key drawback is that the material is static,” said co-author Alon Gorodetsky, UC Irvine associate professor of chemical &amp; biomolecular engineering. “We’ve made a version with changeable properties so you can regulate how much heat is trapped or released.” The UC Irvine researchers took design cues from various species of squids, octopuses and cuttlefish that use their adaptive, dynamic skin to thrive in aquatic environments. A cephalopod’s unique ability to camouflage itself by rapidly changing color is due, in part, to skin cells called chromatophores that can instantly change from minute points to flattened disks. “We use a similar concept in our work, where we have a layer of these tiny metal ‘islands’ that border each other,” said lead author Erica Leung, a UC Irvine graduate student in chemical &amp; biomolecular engineering."</em> <a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/squid-skin-inspires-creation-next-generation-space-blanket">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Physicists at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and partners have demonstrated an experimental, next-generation atomic clock—ticking at high “optical” frequencies—that is much smaller than usual, made of just three small chips plus supporting electronics and optics. Described in Optica, the chip-scale clock is based on the vibrations, or “ticks,” of rubidium atoms confined in a tiny glass container, called a vapor cell, on a chip. Two frequency combs on chips act like gears to link the atoms’ high-frequency optical ticks to a lower, widely used microwave frequency that can be used in applications. The chip-based heart of the new clock requires very little power (just 275 milliwatts) and, with additional technology advances, could potentially be made small enough to be handheld. Chip-scale optical clocks like this could eventually replace traditional oscillators in applications such as navigation systems and telecommunications networks and serve as backup clocks on satellites. “We made an optical atomic clock in which all key components are microfabricated and work together to produce an exceptionally stable output,” NIST Fellow John Kitching said."</em> <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2019/05/nist-team-demonstrates-heart-next-generation-chip-scale-atomic-clock">[...]</a>

This is clean energy that could boom.” Researchers initially concentrated on hybrid vehicles, which now have gas engines as well as batteries due to issues involving limited driving range and long charging times.

The researchers, from the University of Cambridge, programmed a small fleet of miniature robotic cars to drive on a multi-lane track and observed how the traffic flow changed when one of the cars stopped. When the cars were not driving cooperatively, any cars behind the stopped car had to stop or slow down and wait for a gap in the traffic, as would typically happen on a real road. A queue quickly formed behind the stopped car and overall traffic flow was slowed. However, when the cars were communicating with each other and driving cooperatively, as soon as one car stopped in the inner lane, it sent a signal to all the other cars. Cars in the outer lane that were in immediate proximity of the stopped car slowed down slightly so that cars in the inner lane were able to quickly pass the stopped car without having to stop or slow down significantly."</em> <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/driverless-cars-working-together-can-speed-up-traffic-by-35-percent">[...]</a>

The way that this project works is that when wearing the air piano glove, each of the four connected fingers contains a flex sensor that determines if a finger is being bent. When a finger is being bent, the LED on that corresponding finger lights up informing the user this finger has been sufficiently bent, and using Max 8 software, a corresponding note will play from the computer. Thus, each finger corresponds to a unique note and the user will be able to wirelessly play music form an external source via this glove on their hand.

A large part of the materials used here are scrap removed from some equipment and recycled When I started a project of a weather station for my own I realized that the measurement of the intensity and direction of the wind would not be very easy or cheap. After several months I present to you this project that uses mostly recycled materials and very cheap electronic parts easily found in any electronic store. This post has 2 parts.

Up to now, we've kept a laminated sheet of A4 paper stuck to the side of the fridge. It has a grid of tasks printed on it, with associated amounts of pocket money that could be earned for completing that task. The idea is that each time one of our kids helps out with a chore, they get a tick in that box and, at the end of each week, we add up the money earned, wipe the board and start again. However, the list of tasks is out-of-date and hard to change, we sometimes don't remember to wipe the board clean each week, and some tasks need to be performed with different frequencies - some would ideally be done daily, whereas others might only be once a month. So, I set about creating an Arduino-based device to address these issues - my intention was to create something that allowed for easy addition/removal/updating of tasks, a streamlined mechanism for recording when a task had been done and allocating credit to the appropriate person, and a way to keep track of different schedules and frequency with which different tasks need to be performed, and highlight overdue tasks."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Task-Manager-a-Household-Chore-Management-System/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Robotic arms are widely used in industry. Whether it is for assembly operations, welding or even one is used for docking on ISS (International Space Station), they help humans in work or they replace human totally. Arm that I've built is smaller representation of robotic arm that is supposed to be used for moving objects. It is controlled by arduino pro mini which has already built-in library for controlling servos. Servos are controlled by PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) which isn't hard to program but this library makes it easier. User can control those servos by potentiometers that are designed to act as voltage dividers or from program on PC that uses 4 sliders for controlling servo motors."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Robotic-Arm-Controlled-by-Arduino-and-PC/">[...]</a>
