<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1765, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Fulton">Robert Fulton</a>. Este inventor, engenheiro e artista americano trouxe o barco a vapor da fase experimental para o sucesso comercial. Ele não inventou o barco a vapor, construído no início dos anos 1700, mas aplicou suas habilidades de engenharia no seu projecto. Ele mudou as proporções, equilíbrio e velocidades das ideias já propostas. Em 1807, o trabalho foi concluído no Clermont, o primeiro barco a vapor que foi realmente bem-sucedido e o culminar de muitos anos de trabalho. A sua viagem inaugural foi em 17 de Agosto de Nova York a Albany, uma distância de 150 milhas concluída em 32 horas. Génio mecânico com muitos talentos, ele também projectou um sistema de vias navegáveis interiores, um submarino (Nautilus, 1801) e um navio de guerra a vapor.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1807, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_Laurent">Auguste Laurent</a>. Este químico francês desenvolveu a química orgânica como uma ciência distinta. Por um tempo, ele ajudou Jean Dumas e alargou o seu trabalho, entendendo os compostos orgânicos como derivados das moléculas de hidrocarbonetos. Na cristalografia, ele foi influenciado por René-Just Haüy. Laurent reconheceu que os átomos de carbono formavam ligações com base numa estrutura de pirâmide. Além disso, contra a opinião de muitos colegas, ele rejeitou a ideia de Jöns Berzelius de que mesmo moléculas orgânicas eram formadas a partir de entidades carregadas positiva e negativamente. Laurent mostrou (1836) que um átomo de hidrogénio com carga positiva poderia ser substituído por um átomo de cloro com carga negativa. Ele reconheceu famílias de compostos orgânicos com grupos característicos.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1863, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Baekeland">Leo Baekeland</a>. Este industrial e químico belga-americano inventou o primeiro plástico termo-endurecível, a baquelite, que não amaciava quando aquecido. A sua primeira invenção bem-sucedida foi Velox (na década de 1890), um papel fotográfico que poderia ser usado com luz artificial em vez de luz solar, que ele vendeu em 1899 a George Eastman. Ele então experimentou encontrar um substituto sintético para goma-laca, um isolador útil de fios em bobinas eléctricas. Eventualmente, ele foi capaz de controlar o calor e a pressão para uma reacção formaldeído-fenol. Em 1909, ele mostrou o primeiro plástico totalmente sintético do mundo, que poderia ser usado não apenas para isoladores, mas moldado em botões, maçanetas e inúmeros outros itens. Com este produto patenteado, ele ajudou a fundar a moderna indústria de plásticos.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1891, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Banting">Frederick Banting</a>. Este médico fisiologista canadiano, assistido por Charles H. Best, foi o primeiro a extrair (1921) a hormona insulina do pâncreas. As injecções de insulina provaram ser o primeiro tratamento eficaz para o diabetes, uma doença na qual a glicose se acumula em quantidades anormalmente altas no sangue. Banting recebeu uma parte do Prêmio Nobel de Fisiologia ou Medicina de 1923 por essa conquista.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1913, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcom_McLean">Malcom McLean</a>. Este empresário e inventor americano  desenvolveu o contentor de transporte de metal que agora é usado para transportar mercadorias em navios, comboios e camiões de mercadorias. Os contentores padronizados são fortes o suficiente para empilhar várias camadas nos navios e simplificam bastante o manuseio de carga por guindastes, com grande economia de custos com o trabalho de carregar e descarregar mercadorias num número maior de unidades menores de caixas e sacos. Ao dirigir um único camião para transportar materiais nos primeiros anos, ele fundou a McLean Trucking Co., que se tornou a segunda maior nos EUA. Quando percebeu que um camião e sua carroçaria de carga podiam ser separados, ele expandiu para o manuseio seguro de contentores. que podem ser empilhados para transporte em massa.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a conhecer o projecto que o GitHub está a desenvolver com vista à preservação do software open-source. O GitHub está em parceria com a Long Now Foundation, o Internet Archive, a Software Heritage Foundation, o Arctic World Archive, a Microsoft Research, a Bodleian Library e a Stanford Libraries para garantir a preservação a longo prazo do software de código aberto do mundo. Esse conhecimento inestimável será protegido, pelo armazenamento de várias cópias, continuamente, em vários formatos e locais de dados, incluindo um arquivo de longo prazo projetado para durar pelo menos 1.000 anos.
No dia 2 de Fevereiro de 2020 será feito um snapshot do que se encontra no Github e serão arquivados no Arctic Code Vault todos os repositórios públicos activos do GitHub, além de repositórios inactivos significativos, conforme determinado por estrelas, dependências e um painel consultivo. O snapshot consistirá no HEAD da ramificação padrão de cada repositório, menos os binários maiores que 100 KB. Cada repositório será empacotado como um único arquivo TAR. Para maior densidade e integridade dos dados, a maioria dos dados será armazenada em código QR. Um índice e um guia legíveis por humanos detalham a localização de cada repositório e explicam como recuperar os dados.
O Arctic Code Vault do GitHub é um repositório de dados preservado no Arctic World Archive (AWA). O arquivo encontra-se localizado numa antiga mina de carvão desactivada a 250 metros de profundidade no permafrost de uma montanha no Artico em Svalbard.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como um modelo 3D que poderá ser útil. É  apresentada a revista newelectronics de 12 de Novembro de 2019.</p>

<p><em>"ASUS and Google have joined forces to develop a new project that the companies are calling ‘Tinker Board’ single board computers (SBCs). With a footprint not much larger than a credit card, the systems are designed for building small systems to work on AI inference applications like image recognition. The systems in question are the Tinker Edge T and Tinker Edge R. The former is based on the NXP i.MX8M with an Edge TPU chip that accelerates TensorFlow Lite, whereas the Tinker Edge R is powered by the Rockchip RK3399 Pro processor with an NPU for 4K machine learning. The SBCs officially support Android and Debian operating system, though nothing prevents them from running Linux or other OSes. Both Tinker Edge T and Tinker Edge R computers feature active cooling as well as mainstream I/O interfaces, including GbE, USB 3.0, and HDMI. ASUS and Google position their Tinker Edge T and Tinker Edge R for various edge AI applications that have to be compact and very energy efficient."</em> <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/15095/asus-google-team-up-for-tinker-board-aifocused-creditcard-sized-computers">[...]</a>

<p><em>"China on Thursday successfully completed a crucial landing test in northern Hebei province ahead of a historic unmanned exploration mission to Mars next year. China is on track to launch its Mars mission, Zhang Kejian, head of the China National Space Administration, said on Thursday, speaking to foreign diplomats and the media before the test. The Mars lander underwent a hovering-and-obstacle avoidance test at a sprawling site in Huailai, northwest of Beijing. The site was littered with small mounds of rocks to simulate the uneven terrain on Mars which the lander would have to navigate on its descent to the planet’s surface. “In 2016, China officially began the Mars exploration mission work, and currently all of the different development work is progressing smoothly,” Zhang said. “The hovering-and-obstacle avoidance test for the Mars lander being carried out today makes up a crucial part of the development process."</em> <a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/space-exploration-china-mars/china-completes-crucial-landing-test-for-first-mars-mission-in-2020-idINKBN1XO0IO">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Invisible infrared light accounts for half of all solar radiation on the Earth’s surface, yet ordinary solar energy systems have limited ability in converting it to power. A breakthrough in research at KTH could change that. A research team led by Hans Ågren, professor in theoretical chemistry at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, has developed a film that can be applied on top of ordinary solar cells, which would enable them to use infrared light in energy conversion and increase efficiency by 10 percent or more. “We have achieved a 10 percent increase in efficiency without yet optimizing the technology,” Ågren says. “With a little more work, we estimate that a 20 to 25 percent increase in efficiency could be achieved.” Photosensitive materials used in solar cells, such as the mineral perovskite, have a limited ability to respond to infrared light. The solution, developed with KTH researchers Haichun Liu and Qingyun Liu, was to combine nanocrystals with chains of microlenses."</em> <a href="https://www.kth.se/en/aktuellt/nyheter/nano-technology-breakthrough-enables-conversion-of-infrared-light-to-energy-1.936083">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://me.gatech.edu/atomic-level-imaging-new-metal-properties">Atomic-level imaging could offer roadmap to metals with new properties</a></h2>

<p><em>"High-entropy alloys, which are made from nearly equal parts of several primary metals, could hold great potential for creating materials with superior mechanical properties. But with a practically unlimited number of possible combinations, one challenge for metallurgists is figuring out where to focus their research efforts in a vast, unexplored world of metallic mixtures. A team of researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology has developed a new process that could help guide such efforts. Their approach involves building an atomic resolution chemical map to help gain new insights into individual high-entropy alloys and help characterize their properties. In a study published Oct. 9 in the journal Nature, the researchers described using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy to create maps of individual metals in two high-entropy alloys. This spectroscopy technique, used in conjunction with transmission electron microscopy, detects X-rays emitted from a sample during bombardment by an electron beam to characterize the elemental composition of an analyzed sample."</em> <a href="http://me.gatech.edu/atomic-level-imaging-new-metal-properties">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Practise makes perfect ­– it is an adage that has helped humans become highly dexterous, and now it is an approach that is being applied to robots. Computer scientists at the University are using the artificial intelligence (AI) techniques of automated planning and reinforcement learning to “train” a robot to find an object in a cluttered space, such as a warehouse shelf or in a fridge – and move it.

<p><em>"Materials made from nanoscale particles, ranging in size from a few atoms up to less than one-percent of the width of a human hair, create opportunities to design new functional materials having unique responses to external stimuli, such as light, electrical and magnetic fields and mechanical deformation. Embedding such particles in a “matrix” (referring to a surrounding medium or structure) composed of a different material makes it possible to create nanocomposites that enable new technologies. The central challenges in developing transformative nanoparticle-based devices have been summarized in an article review co-authored by Tyler Ray, a University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa engineering professor, and Matthew Begley and Daniel Gianola of UC Santa Barbara’s College of Engineering. “Bridging functional nanocomposites to robust macroscale devices,” published in a recent issue of SCIENCE, illustrates that a central need for tomorrow’s materials scientists and engineers is to gain sufficient control during processing at multiple size scales. In order to create new devices, synthesized materials must be able to survive, intact, the strong forces that are encountered in manufacturing processes, at size scales from the atomic scale to the human scale. The review describes the current state of the field, maps out future research directions and identifies challenges to progress."</em> <a href="https://www.eng.hawaii.edu/nanoscale-discoveries/">[...]</a>

Now, a team of researchers from the University of Delaware and the University of Pennsylvania, with primary support from the U.S. Department of Energy Biomolecular Materials Program, has created a new fundamental unit of polymers that could usher in a new era of materials discovery. The researchers designed and created rigid, self-assembling, customizable polymer chains by linking together new building blocks called bundlemers — a term coined at UD. They recently described their work in the journal Nature. To create bundlemers, the team assembles four individual peptides, themselves short chains of amino acids, into nanoscopic cylinders.

The results of their study supported by a Russian Science Foundation (RSF) grant were published in the journal Materials Today. A truly remarkable property of quantum materials, superconductivity is a complete loss of electrical resistance under quite particular, and sometimes, very harsh conditions. Despite the tremendous potential for quantum computers and high-sensitivity detectors, the application of quantum materials is hindered by the fact that superconductivity typically manifests itself at very low temperatures or extremely high pressures. Until recently, the list of superconductors was topped by mercury-containing cuprate that becomes superconducting at 135 K (-138 °C). This year, lanthanum decahydride, LaH10, has set a new record of -13 oС, which is very close to room temperature, although in the case of LaH10 superconductivity is achieved at nearly 2 million atmospheres, a pressure that can hardly be attained in real life."</em> <a href="https://www.skoltech.ru/en/2019/11/thorium-superconductivity-scientists-discover-a-new-high-temperature-superconductor/">[...]</a>

He recently created an updated version and today’s tutorial will focus on how this new version of the Geiger Counter can be replicated. The Geiger counter is an instrument used for detecting and measuring ionizing radiation. It is one of the worlds best-known radiation detection instrument as it can be used to detect ionizing radiation such as alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays and its is usually used as a handheld radiation survey instrument, warning users when in the region of dangerous ambient radiation levels with an all-too-familiar clicking noise. While this project retains some of the features from the first version, like the use of the ESP8266 and a touchscreen interface, rather than just implementing the detection of radiation levels like the first version, it combines a Geiger counter, a dosimeter and a radiation monitoring together in a single package that is 50% less thick, and with loads of new software features! Some of the new features include: A more intuitive GUI Displays counts per minute, current dose, and accumulated dose on the home screen Sensitive and reliable SBM-20 Geiger-Muller tube Variable integration time for averaging dose rate Timed count mode for measuring low doses Users can choose between Sieverts and Rems as the units for the displayed dose rate User-adjustable alert threshold Adjustable calibration to relate CPM to dose rate for various isotopes Offline data logging Post bulk-logged data to a cloud service (ThingSpeak) to graph, analyze and/or save to computer Monitoring Station mode: device stays connected to WiFi and regularly posts ambient radiation level to ThingSpeak channel 2000 mAh rechargeable LiPo battery with a 16 hour run time and a micro USB charging port No programming required from the end-user as things like the WiFi setup is handled through the user interface."</em> <a href="https://www.electronics-lab.com/project/new-improved-geiger-counter-now-wifi/">[...]</a>

Since we're giving these to people who for the most part aren't hardware oriented, these robots need to be even more robust than the original one.

During normal operation with a good locomotion controller, the motors barely even get above ambient (even going 3.7 m/s, the motors weren't warm to the touch afterwards). However, it's really easy to write a controller that rapidly heats up the motors without actually doing anything - railing torque commands back-and-forth due to instability, joints mechanically stuck against something, machine-learning algorithm flailing around wildly, etc. We haven't burned out any motors on the original Mini Cheetah yet, but I think our lab members all have a pretty good sense of what's good/bad for the robot, and know to shut it down quickly if something bad is happening."</em> <a href="https://build-its-inprogress.blogspot.com/2019/10/motor-temperature-estimation-without.html">[...]</a>

This project takes advantage of some special properties of acrylic. Inside polished acrylic, light rays reflect off the smooth inner surfaces, preferring to escape at the rougher edges or scatter at imperfections in the surface. This internal reflection causes the light to suffuse the entire acrylic shape with a subtle uniform glow, even where it bends and curves. We can take advantage of light scattering by engraving patterns into the smooth surface of acrylic sheet then illuminating the sheet to generate a brighter glow at the etched spots.

<p><em>"Have you worked with ready-made 8x8 LED matrix as displays? They come in various sizes and are quite interesting to work with. A large readily available size is around 60mm x 60mm. However, if you are looking for a much larger ready-made LED matrix, you may be out of luck. For this project, we will be building a single color large LED matrix display which is made up of a few large 8x8 LED 10mm matrix modules daisy-chained together. Each of these 8x8 LED matrix modules is around 100mm x 100mm in size."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Build-8x8-BIG-LED-Matrix-MAX7219-LED-10mm/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Personalized-Message-Displaying-Trinkets/">Personalized Message Displaying Trinkets</a></h2>

<p><em>"Around last month, we were welcoming our new freshmen to the department. My friend came up with an idea that we should have some kind of gifts for them, and this is my take for that. It took me a day to experiment on how to build the first one, then several hours to build the rest 4. The trinket is ATTINY414-controlled. The message is stored on the MCU and then displayed one letter at a time on the common anode 7 segments display. You could have a very long message since my 10 letters word used up only 400 bytes of program space on the 4k device."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Personalized-Message-Displaying-Trinkets/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://luckyresistor.me/projects/snow-flake-decoration/">Snow Flake Decoration</a></h2>

<p><em>"The snow flake project is a winter decoration consisting of a number of snow flake boards connected to one single string of wire. Each snow flake contains an own micro controller and 19 bright and beautiful white LEDs. Using very small and bright LEDs creates a unique and beautiful effect, like the sunlight sparkling in snow crystals. At the start, the individual snow flakes will communicate with each other and determine the own location in the strand. Next they display light patterns, which are synchronised between all boards. Technically, the design is dead simple."</em> <a href="https://luckyresistor.me/projects/snow-flake-decoration/">[...]</a>
