<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1811, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Robert_Grove">William Robert Grove</a>. Este físico galês, foi o primeiro a apresentar provas da dissociação térmica de átomos dentro de uma molécula. Ele mostrou que o vapor em contacto com um fio de platina muito aquecido é decomposto em hidrogénio e oxigénio numa reacção reversível. Em 1839, Grove misturou hidrogénio e oxigénio na presença de um electrólito e produziu electricidade e água. Esta Grove Cell foi a invenção da célula de combustível. A tecnologia não foi seriamente revisitada até a década de 1960. Através do processo electroquímico, a energia armazenada num combustível é convertida - sem combustão de combustível - directamente em electricidade DC. Grove também desenvolveu a célula eléctrica de dois fluidos, consistindo de zinco amalgamado em ácido sulfúrico diluído e um cátodo de platina em ácido nítrico concentrado, sendo os líquidos separados por um recipiente poroso. Dessa forma, ele produziu luz eléctrica para uma de suas palestras na London Institution, onde foi professor de física (1840–1847).</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1857, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Larmor">Joseph Larmor</a>. Este Físico irlandês foi o primeiro a calcular a taxa na qual a energia é irradiada por um electrão acelerado, e o primeiro a explicar a divisão de linhas de espectro por um campo magnético. As suas teorias baseavam-se na crença de que a matéria é composta inteiramente de partículas eléctricas movendo-se no éter. A sua elaborada teoria eléctrica matemática do final da década de 1890 incluía o "electrão" como uma tensão rotacional (uma espécie de torção) no éter. Mas a teoria de Larmor não descreve o electrão como parte do átomo. Muitos físicos imaginaram tanto as partículas materiais quanto as forças electromagnéticas como estruturas e tensões nesse fluido hipotético.</p>

<p>Faz igual anos hoje que nascia, em 1902, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Goudsmit">Samuel Goudsmit</a>. Este Físico norte-americano nascido na Holanda, com George E. Uhlenbeck, um colega de pós-graduação na Universidade de Leiden, Neth, formulou (1925) o conceito de spin do electrão. Isto levou ao reconhecimento de que o spin era uma propriedade de protões, neutrões e partículas mais elementares e a uma mudança fundamental na estrutura matemática da mecânica quântica. Goudsmit também fez a primeira medição do spin nuclear e seu efeito Zeeman com Ernst Back (1926-27), desenvolveu uma teoria de estrutura hiperfina de linhas espectrais, fez a primeira determinação espectroscópica de momentos magnéticos nucleares (1931-33), contribuiu para a teoria de átomos complexos e a teoria do espalhamento múltiplo de electrões, e inventou o espectrómetro de massa de tempo-de-voo magnético (1948).</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1916, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Prokhorov">Alexander Prokhorov</a>. Este Físico soviético recebeu (com Nikolay G. Basov, URSS e Charles H. Townes, EUA), o Prémio Nobel de Física em 1964 "por trabalhos fundamentais no campo da electrónica quântica, o que levou à construção de osciladores e amplificadores com base no princípio maser-laser". "Maser" significa "amplificação por micro-ondas por emissão estimulada de radiação". Uma amplificação só pode ocorrer se a emissão estimulada for maior que a absorção, exigindo que haja mais átomos num estado de alta energia do que num mais baixo. Este estado é chamado de população invertida. Prokhorov pesquisou o maser de maneira independente, mas simultaneamente com os outros laureados.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1924, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9sar_Lattes">César Lattes</a>. Este Físico brasileiro, juntamente com o físico americano Eugene Gardner, da Universidade da Califórnia, em Berkeley, em 1948, confirmou a existência de mesons pesados e leves formados durante o bombardeio de núcleos de carbono com partículas alfa. A descoberta experimental do méson pi foi fundamental para explicar a força de ligação nuclear. O físico teórico japonês Hideki Yukawa propôs (1935) uma nova e desconhecida partícula com 200 vezes mais massa do que o electrão, que foi emitida e absorvida por protões e neutrões. A troca dessas partículas entre os núcleons produziria uma atracção de curto alcance entre eles.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1927, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Maiman">Theodore Maiman</a>. Este Físico norte-americano construiu o primeiro laser em funcionamento. Ele começou a trabalhar com dispositivos electrónicos na sua adolescência, enquanto ganhava dinheiro na faculdade arranjando electrodomésticos e rádios. Na década de 1960, ele desenvolveu, demonstrou e patenteou um laser usando um meio rosa rubi. O laser é um dispositivo que produz luz coerente monocromática (luz na qual os raios são todos do mesmo comprimento de onda e fase). Desde então, o laser tem sido aplicado numa ampla variedade de usos, incluindo cirurgia ocular, odontologia, localização de faixas, manufactura e até a medição da distância entre a Terra e a Lua.</p>

<p>Há 40 anos atrás, a primeira estação espacial Skylab reentrava na atmosfera terrestre perto da Austrália. Lançada em maio de 1973 a bordo do último Saturno V para voar, a Skylab consistia na parte Saturn S-IVB 212 equipada para abrigar tripulações visitantes. Três equipas permaneceram em 1973 e 1974, realizando observações solares, corrigindo problemas e lidando com os desafios do voo espacial de longa duração. A Skylab orbitou a Terra 2.476 vezes durante os 171 dias e 13 horas de ocupação durante as três expedições tripuladas, tinha um peso aproximado de 77 mil quilos.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou foi publicada oficialmente a versão 5.2 do Kernel Linux. Esta nova versão foi anunciada pelo criador do Linux, Linus Torvalds, e representa um trabalho que foi sendo feito ao longo de várias versões Candidatas no sentido de apresentar uma nova versão de Kernel (que não é LTS) mas que tem melhorias significativas ao nível de drivers para suportar novo hardware, e diversas novas funcionalidades. Destas novas funcionalidades destacam-se o Sound Open Firmware que dá suporte para dispositivos de audio DSP no Kernel, uma nova API para montar filesystems, novos GPU drivers para o ARM Mali, suporte para nomes insensíveis a maiúsculas e minúsculas em filesystems EXT4 assim como melhorias no scheduler BFQ I/O. Foram também introduzidas alterações no Kernel ao nível da segurança para proteger os sistemas de bugs de CPU.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou a sonda japonesa Hayabusa2 fez um pouso "perfeito" no asteróide Ryugu e recolheu amostras debaixo da superfície numa missão sem precedentes que poderá lançar luz sobre as origens do sistema solar. O asteróide Ryugu e a sonda encontram-se a 245 milhões de quilómetros da Terra. Espera-se que a sonda possa regressar com as amostras, como planeado, em 2020.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. É apresentada também a revista newelectronics de 9 de Julho.</p>

<p><em>"Linus Torvalds has announced today the release and general availability of the Linux 5.2 kernel series, a major release that adds several new features, updated drivers, and many improvements. After seven RCs (Release Candidates), the Linux 5.2 kernel series is now available and it comes with some very interesting features and enhancements. However, before we dive into what's new, you should know that this release is not a long-term supported (LTS) branch, which means that you stick with your current LTS kernel instead. "I was somewhat pre-disposed towards making an rc8, simply because of my travels and being entirely off the internet for a few days last week," said Linus Torvalds in a mailing list announcement. "So despite a fairly late core revert, I don't see any real reason for another week of rc, and so we have a v5.2 with the normal release timing." Here's what's new in Linux kernel 5.2 Highlights of Linux kernel 5.2 include Sound Open Firmware, an open-source firmware that provides support for DSP audio devices, a new mount API for mounting file systems, new open-source GPU drivers for ARM Mali devices, support for case-insensitive names in the EXT4 file system, as well as performance improvements to the BFQ I/O scheduler."</em> <a href="https://news.softpedia.com/news/linux-kernel-5-2-officially-released-here-s-what-s-new-526644.shtml">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The Hayabusa2 probe made a “perfect” touchdown Thursday on a distant asteroid and collected samples from beneath the surface in an unprecedented mission that could shed light on the origins of the solar system. “We’ve collected a part of the solar system’s history,” Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) project manager Yuichi Tsuda said at a jubilant news conference in Sagamihara, Kanagawa Prefecture, hours after the successful landing was confirmed. “We have never gathered subsurface material from a celestial body further away than the moon,” he added. “We did it and we succeeded in a world first.” The fridge-sized probe made its second landing on the asteroid around 10:30 a.m., with officials from JAXA breaking into applause and cheers at the mission control room in Sagamihara as initial data suggested the touchdown had been a success. Confirmation of the landing came only after Hayabusa2 lifted back up from the asteroid and resumed communications with the control room. Research Director Takashi Kubota told reporters that the touchdown operation was “more than perfect.” And Tsuda, with a grin, said he rated it “1,000 points out of 100.” “The probe moved perfectly and the team’s preparation work was perfect,” he said."</em> <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/07/11/national/science-health/japans-hayabusa2-probe-makes-second-touchdown-distant-asteroid/#.XSaxrZNKi9s#.XSaxrZNKi9s">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This week at SEMICON West in San Francisco, Intel engineering leaders provided an update on Intel’s advanced packaging capabilities and unveiled new building blocks, including innovative uses of EMIB and Foveros together and a new Omni-Directional Interconnect (ODI) technology. When combined with Intel’s world-class process technologies, new packaging capabilities will unlock customer innovations and deliver the computing systems of tomorrow. “Our vision is to develop leadership technology to connect chips and chiplets in a package to match the functionality of a monolithic system-on-chip. A heterogeneous approach gives our chip architects unprecedented flexibility to mix and match IP blocks and process technologies with various memory and I/O elements in new device form factors. Intel’s vertically integrated structure provides an advantage in the era of heterogeneous integration, giving us an unmatched ability to co-optimize architecture, process and packaging to deliver leadership products.” –Babak Sabi, Intel corporate vice president, Assembly and Test Technology Development Why It’s Important: Chip packaging has always played a critical – if under-recognized – role in the electronics supply chain. As the physical interface between the processor and the motherboard, the package provides a landing zone for a chip’s electrical signals and power supply."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news/intel-unveils-new-tools-advanced-chip-packaging-toolbox/">[...]</a>

The new findings appear in the journal Nature Communications, in a paper by postdoc Yi Ding, professors of materials science and engineering Alfredo Alexander-Katz and Caroline Ross, and three others. “This is a discovery that was in some sense fortuitous,” says Alexander-Katz. “Everyone thought this was not possible,” he says, describing the team’s discovery of a phenomenon that allows the polymers to self-assemble in patterns that deviate from regular symmetrical arrays. Self-assembling block copolymers are materials whose chain-like molecules, which are initially disordered, will spontaneously arrange themselves into periodic structures."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/block-copolymers-thin-films-0705">[...]</a>

Now, a theory developed to describe the technique could lead to new applications for additive nanomanufacturing and new nanoscale materials. Based on focused electron beam deposition, the technique allows structures to be fabricated from gas-phase precursors at rates approaching what could be expected in the liquid phase – all without raising the temperature of substrates. That could lead to manufacturing of the nanometer-scale structures at rates that could make them practical for use in magnetic memory, high-frequency antennas, quantum communication devices, spintronics and atomic-scale resonators. “We are controlling matter on the atomic scale to bring about new modes of additive manufacturing,” said Andrei Fedorov, a professor in the George W.

The technique squeezes quantum dots, tiny particles made of thousands of atoms, to emit single photons (individual particles of light) with precisely the same color and with positions that can be less than a millionth of a meter apart. “This breakthrough could accelerate the development of quantum information technologies and brain-inspired computing,” said Allan Bracker, a chemist at NRL and one of the researchers on the project. In order for quantum dots to “communicate” (interact), they have to emit light at the same wavelength. The size of a quantum dot determines this emission wavelength."</em> <a href="https://www.nrl.navy.mil/news/node/794">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers in the lab of Professor Aaron Wheeler (Chemistry, IBBME) have demonstrated a novel and non-invasive way to manipulate cells through microrobotics. Cell manipulation — which requires moving small particles from one place to another — is an integral part of many scientific endeavours. One method of manipulating cells is through optoelectronic tweezers (OET), which use various light patterns to directly interact with the object of interest. Because of this direct interaction, there are limitations to the force that can be applied and speed in which the cellular material can be manipulated. This is where the use of microrobotics becomes useful. Led by postdoctoral fellow Dr. Shuailong Zhang (Chemistry) and Wheeler, the researchers have designed microrobots (working at the sub-millimetre scale) that can be operated by OET for cell manipulation."</em> <a href="https://news.engineering.utoronto.ca/microrobots-to-change-the-way-we-work-with-cellular-material/">[...]</a>

Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves. Polynomial Regression:-polynomial regression is a form of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modelled as an nth degree polynomial in x. Prediction:-Machine learning is a way of identifying patterns in data and using them to automatically make predictions or decisions. ...

<p><em>"Spi-Box is a Raspberry Pi-based, motion-activated camera designed to use as a DIY kit for beginners and security purposes. Spi-Box is a Raspberry Pi based motion activated camera designed to use as a DIY kit for beginners and security purposes. Spi-Box can send an e-mail notification with an attachment of the captured image or video. Here are the things you will need to set up a Spi-Box: - Raspberry Pi model 2 / 3 / 3B+ models - Spi-Box Case - Raspberry Pi Camera - PIR Sensor - Jumper Wires F-F Keep caution while assembling Spi-Box, better turn off the power supply if you are using as a beginner. Spi-Box Hardware Configuration Please be aware that the bottom half of the case of the Spi-Box is shallower than other SB Components’ cases making the mounting process slightly different: - Line up the HDMI side of the pi with the lower half of the case and ease it into place at a slight angle pressing down gently but firmly until the mounting posts (highlighted in red)click into place in the Pi’s screw mounting holes. - Press the other side of the board down into place gently but firmly until the mounting posts on the GPIO side of the board click into place in the board’s screw-mounting holes."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/sbcomponentsuk/spi-box-a-motion-activated-security-camera-ac29d1">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This a simple Arduino/3D printing project about colors and sounds. I made this device or as I call it color instrument for activity for kids. Its fun and its a good conversation starter about physics of colors and sound. The most interesting fact about colors, in my opinion of course, is that pink color doesnt exists in physics. I know, I know, you all thinking its a lie, but next time you look at the rainbow try to find pink color! Basically white light is made of all the colors you can see in the rainbow from red to purple."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Color-Instrument/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The thing you need when your TV remote power button fails. A while back the power button on my remote started to fail. It's become harder to get it to send the IR code to turn on the TV. The contact is likely dirty but didn't want to risk destroying the remote by the extreme violence it that would be required to get the shell open. Frustrated, I threw together a quick and dirty solution using one of my Atmega328P Target boards, a AA battery pack, an IR LED, a transistor, a push button, an AMS sample box I had laying around, and the requisite wiring and rubber band to hold it all together. A bit on the crude side, but it works!"</em> <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/163910-tv-b-onthe-box">[...]</a>

The RTC module is connected to the Arduino on the A4 (SDA) and A5 (SCL) pins. The button is connected to digital pin 3, with the Arduino's internal pull-up resistor enabled via software.The program uses some libraries that you will have to install before compiling. Unzip the libraries and place them inside the LIBRARIES folder of the Arduino IDE.
