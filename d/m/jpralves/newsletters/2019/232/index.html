<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1731, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cavendish">Henry Cavendish</a>. Este químico e físico inglês determinou a massa e a densidade da Terra. Ele investigou as propriedades do hidrogénio e do dióxido de carbono, incluindo a comparação entre a sua densidade e a do ar. Cavendish também mostrou que a água era um composto e mediu o calor específico de várias substâncias. Os seus manuscritos (publicados em 1879) revelaram descobertas que ele fez em electrostática antes de Coulomb, Ohm e Faraday - incluindo a dedução da lei do quadrado inverso da atracção e repulsão electrostática. Ele também encontrou capacidade indutiva específica.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1892, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earle_Dickson">Earle Dickson</a>. Este inventor americano ficou conhecido pela invenção do penso rápido. O seu emprego era como comprador de algodão na Johnson &amp; Johnson, onde sua sugestão de torná-lo um produto se tornou uma realidade.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1896, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_Germer">Lester Germer</a>. Este Físico americano com o seu colega Clinton Joseph Davisson, conduziu uma experiência que foi a primeira a demonstrar as propriedades das ondas do electrão. Eles mostraram que um feixe de electrões dispersos por um cristal produz um padrão de difracção característico de uma onda. Esta experiência confirmou a hipótese de Louis-Victor de Broglie, fundador da mecânica das ondas, de que o electrão deveria mostrar as propriedades de uma onda electromagnética e de uma partícula. Ele também estudou termiônica, erosão de metais e física de contacto.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou, o CEO da Arm, Simon Segars anunciou, na sua conferencia Arm® TechCon 2019, o Arm Custom Instructions, um novo recurso da arquitetura Armv8-M. As instruções personalizadas da Arm serão implementadas inicialmente nos CPUs Arm Cortex®-M33 a partir do primeiro semestre de 2020, sem custos adicionais para licenciamentos novos e existentes, permitindo que os designers de SoC adicionem as suas próprias instruções para aplicações incorporadas específicas e de IoT, sem risco de fragmentação de software.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou uma equipa liderada por Scott S. Sheppard, da Carnegie, encontrou 20 novas luas a orbitar Saturno. Isto aumenta o número total de luas do planeta para 82, superando Júpiter, que tem 79. A descoberta foi anunciada nesta segunda-feira pelo Minor Planet Center da União Astronómica Internacional. Cada uma das luas recém-descobertas tem cerca de cinco quilómetros de diâmetro. Dezessete delas orbitam o planeta para trás, ou em uma direcção oposta, significando que seu movimento é oposto à rotação do planeta em torno de seu eixo. As outras três luas orbitam na mesma direcção em que Saturno gira.</p>

<p>E é já amanhã que vamos ter mais uma Lisbon Maker Faire, desta vez organizado pela equipa do Fab Lab Benfica, e localizado na Escola Superior de Educação do Politécnico de Lisboa. O horário na sexta-feira é da 10:00 às 18:00 e no sábado das 10:00 às 19:30. As  entradas são grátis por isso apareçam!</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. É apresentada a revista newelectronics de 8 de Outubro.</p>

<p><em>"Today at Arm® TechCon 2019, Arm CEO Simon Segars announced Arm Custom Instructions, a new feature for the Armv8-M architecture. Arm Custom Instructions will initially be implemented in Arm Cortex®-M33 CPUs starting in the first half of 2020 at no additional cost to new and existing licensees, enabling SoC designers to add their own instructions for specific embedded and IoT applications without risk of software fragmentation. “A world of a trillion secure intelligent devices will be built on a diversity of complex use cases requiring increased synergy between hardware and software design,” said Dipti Vachani, senior vice president and general manager, Automotive and IoT Line of Business, Arm. “We have engineered Arm Custom Instructions to fuel closer hardware and software co-design efforts toward achieving application-specific acceleration while unlocking greater device differentiation.” The CPU: A chassis for Arm silicon partner innovation Architected as part of the evolution of the Armv8-M architecture with secure Arm TrustZone™ technology, Arm Custom Instructions are based on a simple guiding principle; the CPU is a chassis for Arm silicon partner innovation. This approach gives chip designers the opportunity to push performance and efficiency further by adding their unique application-specific features into Cortex-M33 CPUs. Arm Custom Instructions are enabled by modifications to the CPU that reserve encoding space for designers to easily add custom datapath extensions while maintaining the integrity of the existing software ecosystem."</em> <a href="https://www.arm.com/company/news/2019/10/arm-enables-custom-instructions-for-embedded-cpus">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A team led by Carnegie's Scott S. Sheppard has found 20 new moons orbiting Saturn. This brings the ringed planet’s total number of moons to 82, surpassing Jupiter, which has 79. The discovery was announced Monday by the International Astronomical Union’s Minor Planet Center. Each of the newly discovered moons is about five kilometers, or three miles, in diameter. Seventeen of them orbit the planet backwards, or in a retrograde direction, meaning their movement is opposite of the planet's rotation around its axis. The other three moons orbit in the prograde—the same direction as Saturn rotates."</em> <a href="https://carnegiescience.edu/news/saturn-surpasses-jupiter-after-discovery-20-new-moons-and-you-can-help-name-them">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Last year, the world reached a major modern milestone – as of 2018, half of the world’s population is online with some form of internet connection. The bad news is that, despite this progress, this status quo still puts billions of people on the wrong side of the digital divide. Leaving half the world without access to the electricity of today’s age – internet access, and increasingly at broadband speeds – means that existing inequalities, poverty and insecurity will persist, worsen and become increasingly difficult to address. Efforts to accelerate internet access globally, with a focus on developing nations, are not new. But it’s clear that the world needs a new approach to this work. The UN State of Broadband Report found that broadband adoption has slowed, and progress is especially elusive in low-income countries and rural areas across the globe."</em> <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2019/10/07/the-path-to-prosperity-through-access-to-high-speed-internet/">[...]</a>

While the molecules in liquids swim around at random, neighboring molecules in liquid crystals are aligned as in regular crystal grids, but the material is still liquid. Liquid crystals are thus an example of an intermediate state that is neither really solid nor really liquid­­.

<h2><a href="https://pratt.duke.edu/about/news/print-in-place-electronics">Printed Electronics Open Way for Electrified Tattoos and Personalized Biosensors</a></h2>

<p><em>"The first demonstration of a fully print-in-place electronics technique is gentle enough to work on surfaces as delicate as human skin and paper Electrical engineers at Duke University have devised a fully print-in-place technique for electronics that is gentle enough to work on delicate surfaces including paper and human skin. The advance could enable technologies such as high-adhesion, embedded electronic tattoos and bandages tricked out with patient-specific biosensors. The techniques are described in a series of papers published online July 9 in the journal Nanoscale and on October 3 in the journal ACS Nano. “When people hear the term ‘printed electronics,’ the expectation is that a person loads a substrate and the designs for an electronic circuit into a printer and, some reasonable time later, removes a fully functional electronic circuit,” said Aaron Franklin, the James L. and Elizabeth M. Vincent Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Duke. “Over the years there have been a slew of research papers promising these kinds of ‘fully printed electronics,’ but the reality is that the process actually involves taking the sample out multiple times to bake it, wash it or spin-coat materials onto it,” Franklin said. “Ours is the first where the reality matches the public perception.” “Some of the more exotic applications include intimately connected electronic tattoos that could be used for biological tagging or unique detection mechanisms, rapid prototyping for on-the-fly custom electronics, and paper-based diagnostics that could be integrated readily into customized bandages.” The concept of so-called electronic tattoos were first developed in the late 2000s at the University of Illinois by John A. Rogers, who is now the Louis Simpson and Kimberly Querrey Professor of Materials Science and Engineering at Northwestern University."</em> <a href="https://pratt.duke.edu/about/news/print-in-place-electronics">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A*STAR researchers have developed a method to generate large monolayer crystals of molybdenum disulfide for use in scaled-down and flexible electronics. Electronic devices are becoming smaller in size, yet the number of functions each gadget can perform is constantly increasing. Driving these improvements is an essential component known as field-effect transistor (FET). The most common FET in modern times—called MOSFET, short for metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor—was built using silicon around the end of the 1950s. However, silicon-based FETs that are miniaturized below a certain size face issues arising from the short channel effect, which negatively impacts the flow and control of electric current. Scientists led by Dongzhi Chi at the Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE), in collaboration with colleagues at the National University of Singapore and Shenzhen University, China, are now seeking to circumvent this limitation with an alternative material: molybdenum disulfide."</em> <a href="https://research.a-star.edu.sg/articles/highlights/bigger-better-conductive-crystals-a-boon-for-electronics/">[...]</a>

Researchers from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign used a salt-based propellant that had already been proven successful in combustion engines, and demonstrated its compatibility with electrospray thrusters. “We need a propellant that will work in both modes,” said Joshua Rovey, associate professor in the Department of Aerospace Engineering in The Grainger College of Engineering at the U of I. “So, we created a propellant that is a mixture of two commercially available salts--hydroxylammonium nitrate and emim ethylsulfate. We have published other research papers showing that salt propellants work in the high-acceleration combustion mode. Now we know that this unique combination of salts will also work in the electric fuel-efficient mode.” With electrospray or colloid propulsion, the thrusters electrostatically accelerate ions and droplets from these liquids."</em> <a href="https://aerospace.illinois.edu/news/new-salt-based-propellant-proven-compatible-dual-mode-rocket-engines">[...]</a>

Zeolites are a class of natural or manufactured minerals with a sponge-like structure, riddled with tiny pores that make them useful as catalysts or ultrafine filters.

Now, research from MIT helps explain why only this small subset has been found, and could help scientists find or produce more zeolites with desired properties.

They provide a route through which PCBs can be quickly populated with SMD components, however, for accurate results, the heat across the oven needs to be controlled and timed correctly. To achieve this, manufacturers use a kind of controller, like “Tiny Reflow Controller”, and with several DIY reflow ovens being used by makers around the world, we thought it would be a good fit for today’s tutorial to focus on the development of DIY Reflow Oven Controller. As mentioned above, reflow oven controllers are quite important in ensuring just the right amount of heat is applied in the soldering process for SMD components and this importance has led to the development of quite a number of different Reflow oven controller projects, which someone can find on the internet. However, for today’s tutorial, we will look at the first version of Rocket Stream’s tiny Reflow Oven Controller v1 which is probably the most well tested DIY reflow oven controller on the internet, as it is the one being used by Rocket Stream themselves for the manufacturing of their boards.The Rocket Stream’s Reflow Oven Controller v1 is powered by the ATtiny1634R and uses the latest thermocouple sensor interface IC MAX31856 from Maxim. It is one of the cheapest designs on the internet as Rocket Stream was able to reduce the overall cost of the design by not using a development board like the Arduino and using as many SMD parts as possible in place of through-hole components, to reduce the time that goes in and the work involved leaving only the terminal block and the LCD connector as the only through-hole components.The ATtiny1634R is one of the new ATtinys we discussed in the last article."</em> <a href="https://www.electronics-lab.com/project/tiny-reflow-controller-character-lcd/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This is "yet another" PID temperature controller. I've made this one, because bought one was crappy and I needed something solid. There are two or three other DIY controllers "on the market" but this one, at least I see it this way :), is much more robust and has all features I needed. Key features: interface accessible both from LCD screen and WWW webpage unlimited (only by storage) kiln programs number, program file size limited to 10KiB (but this is artificial limit - can be extended) internal ESP storage for programs, data, logs (perhaps later SD - but I'm not sure yet) local preferences on disk, editable with Web interface online monitoring, program management, editing, graphs and kiln controll build in clock synchronised with NTP servers (if Internet connected) safety features build in (temperature run out protection, probe failure, SSR failure, kiln insulation failure) simply cool and cheap (comparing to commercially available products) all in one solution Supplies: - ESP32-Wrover board - MAX31855 breakout board (or two) - K-type thermocouple - DC->AC solid state relay Kind of optional, but recommended: - 128x65 dot matrix LCD 12864B v2 - Rotary encoder with button Optional: - DC/AC secondary relay - like SLA-05VDC-SL-C (240V/30A) mechanical relay - Additional MAX31855 board with K-type thermocouple for housing temperature measuring - Perhaps a kiln :)"</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/PIDKiln-PID-Temperature-Controller-to-Ceramicglass/">[...]</a>

What has happened ???? May be it is the 3-wires cable that has a short circuit.... How to see ? With a voltmeter of course, you can verify... but most of time you will only measure that everything is right.

<p><em>"This article will discuss design practices that ensure better thermal management, including some common methods for removing excess heat from a PCB. Most electronic components dissipate heat whenever a current flows through them. The amount of heat depends on the power, device characteristics, and circuit design. Besides the components, the resistance of the electrical connections, copper traces, and vias contribute to some heat, and power losses. To avoid failures or circuit malfunctions, designers should aim at producing PCBs that operate and remain within safe temperature limits. While some circuits will work without additional cooling, there are situations where adding heat sinks, cooling fans, or a combination of several mechanisms is inevitable."</em> <a href="https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/pcb-thermal-management-techniques/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This project describes a simple low-current meter I devised to check the sleep current of different microcontroller circuits, such as ones based on AVR microcontrollers. It's capable of measuring currents of between 10µA and 30nA with reasonable accuracy, using an ATtiny84 and a few other low-cost parts. Introduction Measuring very small currents accurately is notoriously difficult with normal digital multimeters; they either don't provide a low current range at all, or if they do, they create a voltage drop referred to as the "burden voltage" which can render the display inaccurate. One way round this is to use a precision current adapter, such as David L. Jones's µCurrent [1], but such circuits are expensive. Since I didn't need high accuracy I decided that an alternative approach would be to calculate the current draw based on the time it takes a capacitor to discharge. A capacitor discharging into a resistive load is exponential, like radioactive decay."</em> <a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2S67">[...]</a>
