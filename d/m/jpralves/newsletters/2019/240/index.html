<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1868, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Sommerfeld">Arnold Sommerfeld</a>. Este físico alemão criou um modelo atómico que permitia explicar as linhas espectrais de estrutura fina. O seu primeiro trabalho foi sobre a teoria do giroscópio (com Klein) e, depois, sobre a propagação de ondas na telegrafia sem fio. Mais significativa foi a sua maior contribuição ao desenvolvimento da teoria quântica, em geral, e na sua aplicação a linhas espectrais e ao modelo atómico de Bohr. Ele desenvolveu também uma teoria do electrão no estado metálico, valiosa para o estudo da termoelectricidade.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1879, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clyde_Cessna">Clyde Vernon Cessna</a>. Este piloto norte-americano, fabricante de aeronaves ficou conhecido por ter inventado a asa cantilever e uma configuração de cauda em forma de V assim como um desenho simples e flexível de monoplano. Ele é mais conhecido como o principal fundador da Cessna Aircraft Corporation.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1901, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg">Werner Heisenberg</a>. Este físico e filósofo alemão descobriu uma maneira de formular a mecânica quântica em termos de matrizes (1925). Por esta descoberta, recebeu o Prémio Nobel de Física em 1932. Em 1927, publicou o seu princípio de indeterminação ou incerteza, sobre o qual construiu a sua filosofia e pelo qual é mais conhecido. Ele também fez importantes contribuições às teorias da hidrodinâmica da turbulência, do núcleo atómico, do ferromagnetismo, dos raios cósmicos e das partículas elementares, e planeou o primeiro reactor nuclear alemão pós-Segunda Guerra Mundial, em Karlsruhe, na Alemanha Ocidental.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1903, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._F._Powell">C. F. Powell</a>. Este Físico inglês recebeu o Prémio Nobel de Física em 1950 pelo seu desenvolvimento do método fotográfico de estudo de processos nucleares e pela descoberta resultante do pião (pi-meson), uma partícula subatómica pesada. O pião provou ser a partícula hipotética proposta em 1935 por Yukawa Hideki do Japão na sua teoria.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1932, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Lee_Glashow">Sheldon Lee Glashow</a>. Este Físico teórico americano, com Steven Weinberg e Abdus Salam, recebeu o Prémio Nobel de Física em 1979 pelos seus esforços complementares na formulação da teoria eletrofraca, que explica a unidade do electromagnetismo e da força fraca.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou a NASA apresentou os primeiros resultados da sonda Parker que foi lançada para estudar o Sol. A sonda está resistindo a temperaturas escaldantes para recolher dados, que estão a ser apresentados pela primeira vez em quatro artigos que evidenciam características previamente desconhecidas e apenas teorizadas sobre o nosso volátil vizinho celeste. Durante os seus voos iniciais, a Parker estudou o Sol a uma distância de cerca de 24 milhões de quilómetros. Esta distância é mais próxima do Sol do que Mercúrio, mas a sonda ainda se aproximará ainda mais no futuro, pois viaja a mais de 213.000 km/h, mais rápido do que qualquer outra nave anterior. A informação que a Parker  descobriu sobre como o Sol ejecta constantemente material e energia ajudarão os cientistas a reescrever os modelos que eles usam para entender e prever o clima espacial ao redor do nosso planeta, além de entender o processo pelo qual as estrelas são criadas e evoluem. Estas informações serão vitais para proteger os astronautas e a tecnologia no espaço - uma parte importante do programa Artemis da NASA, que enviará a primeira mulher e o próximo homem para a Lua em 2024 e, eventualmente, para Marte.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. É apresentada a revista MagPi nº88 de Dezembro e também os livros "Raspberry PI Projects Book Volume 5" e "Book of Making Volume 2".</p>

<p><em>"The Sun is revealing itself in dramatic detail and shedding light on how other stars may form and behave throughout the universe – all thanks to NASA's Parker Solar Probe. The spacecraft is enduring scorching temperatures to gather data, which are being shared for the first time in four new papers that illuminate previously unknown and only-theorized characteristics of our volatile celestial neighbor. The information Parker has uncovered about how the Sun constantly ejects material and energy will help scientists rewrite the models they use to understand and predict the space weather around our planet, and understand the process by which stars are created and evolve. This information will be vital to protecting astronauts and technology in space – an important part of NASA’s Artemis program, which will send the first woman and the next man to the Moon by 2024 and, eventually, on to Mars. The four papers, now available online from the journal Nature, describe Parker’s unprecedented near-Sun observations through two record-breaking close flybys. They reveal new insights into the processes that drive the solar wind – the constant outflow of hot, ionized gas that streams outward from the Sun and fills up the solar system – and how the solar wind couples with solar rotation."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/first-nasa-parker-solar-probe-results-reveal-surprising-details-about-our-sun">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A little robotic explorer will be rolling into Antarctica this month to perform a gymnastic feat - driving upside down under sea ice. BRUIE, or the Buoyant Rover for Under-Ice Exploration, is being developed for underwater exploration in extraterrestrial, icy waters by engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. It will spend the next month testing its endurance at Australia's Casey research station in Antarctica, in preparation for a mission that could one day search for life in ocean worlds beyond Earth. There are moons throughout the solar system believed to be covered in deep oceans hidden beneath thick, frozen surfaces. Scientists like Kevin Hand, JPL lead scientist on the BRUIE project, believe that these lunar oceans, such as those on Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus, may be the best places to look for life in our solar system. But first, they'll need a tough aquatic explorer capable of navigating solo through an alien ocean locked under ice sheets that could be 6 to 12 miles (10 to 19 kilometers) thick."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7543">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/coating-solar-cells-touch-screens-1122">Clear, conductive coating could protect advanced solar cells, touch screens</a></h2>

<p><em>"New material should be relatively easy to produce at an industrial scale, researchers say. MIT researchers have improved on a transparent, conductive coating material, producing a tenfold gain in its electrical conductivity. When incorporated into a type of high-efficiency solar cell, the material increased the cell’s efficiency and stability. The new findings are reported today in the journal Science Advances, in a paper by MIT postdoc Meysam Heydari Gharahcheshmeh, professors Karen Gleason and Jing Kong, and three others. “The goal is to find a material that is electrically conductive as well as transparent,” Gleason explains, which would be “useful in a range of applications, including touch screens and solar cells.” The material most widely used today for such purposes is known as ITO, for indium titanium oxide, but that material is quite brittle and can crack after a period of use, she says. Gleason and her co-researchers improved a flexible version of a transparent, conductive material two years ago and published their findings, but this material still fell well short of matching ITO’s combination of high optical transparency and electrical conductivity."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/coating-solar-cells-touch-screens-1122">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The challenge of building an energy future that preserves and improves the planet is a massive undertaking. But it all hinges on the charged particles moving through invisibly small materials. Scientists and politicians have recognized the need for an urgent and sizable shift in the world’s mechanisms of energy production and consumption in order to arrest its momentum toward environmental cataclysm. A course correction of this magnitude is certainly daunting, but a new report in the journal Science suggests that the technological path to achieving sustainability has already been paved, it’s just a matter of choosing to follow it. The report, authored by an international team of researchers, lays out how research in the field of nanomaterials for energy storage over the last two decades has enabled the big step that will be necessary to make use of sustainable energy sources. “Most of the biggest problems facing the push for sustainability can all be tied back to the need for better energy storage,” said Yury Gogotsi, PhD, Distinguished University and Bach professor at Drexel University’s College of Engineering and lead author of the paper."</em> <a href="https://drexel.edu/now/archive/2019/November/nanomaterials-energy-storage/">[...]</a>

Strange metals don’t behave like regular metals, whose electrons act independently; instead their electrons behave in some unusual collective manner. For their part, high-temperature superconductors operate at much higher temperatures than conventional superconductors; how they do this is still unknown. In many high-temperature superconductors, changing the temperature or the number of free-flowing electrons in the material can flip it from a superconducting state to a strange metal state or vice versa. Scientists are trying to find out how these states are related, part of a 30-year quest to understand how high-temperature superconductors work so they can be developed for a host of potential applications, from maglev trains to perfectly efficient power transmission lines."</em> <a href="https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/news/2019-11-21-theorists-probe-relationship-between-strange-metals-and-high-temperature">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Artificial neurons on silicon chips that behave just like the real thing have been invented by scientists – a first-of-its-kind achievement with enormous scope for medical devices to cure chronic diseases, such as heart failure, Alzheimer's, and other diseases of neuronal degeneration. Critically the artificial neurons not only behave just like biological neurons but only need one billionth the power of a microprocessor, making them ideally suited for use in medical implants and other bio-electronic devices. The research team, led by the University of Bath and including researchers from the Universities of Bristol, Zurich and Auckland, describe the artificial neurons in a study published in Nature Communications. Designing artificial neurons that respond to electrical signals from the nervous system like real neurons has been a major goal in medicine for decades, as it opens up the possibility of curing conditions where neurons are not working properly, have has their processes severed as in spinal cord injury, or have died. Artificial neurons could repair diseased bio-circuits by replicating their healthy function and responding adequately to biological feedback to restore bodily function. In heart failure for example, neurons in the base of the brain do not respond properly to nervous system feedback, they in turn do not send the right signals to the heart, which then does not pump as hard as it should."</em> <a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2019/december/artificial-neurons.html">[...]</a>

Hydrogen molecules seek out and automatically repair errors in atomic-scale circuitry and can be used to significantly improve the rewriting speeds of atomic data storage. This work builds on the decades-long dedication by Wolkow’s research group to realizing the potential for atomic-scale manufacturing, something that has shifted from an idealistic dream to an ever more likely reality in the next few years. “It will take a couple of years, but there’s an actual path to atomic-scale devices that will be very impactful for our world,” said Roshan Achal, lead author on the new discovery, currently completing his PhD with Wolkow."</em> <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/science/news/2019/november/data-storage-ai-carbon-emissions">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scientists at Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech) combine forced convection cooling with thermo-electrochemical energy conversion to create a self-sustaining liquid cooling system. A liquid electrolyte is circulated through a cell to cool a hot object, and the reversible chemical reaction in the cell generates a higher electric power than the hydrodynamic pump work required to drive the liquid through the cell. This technology resolves the longstanding unaddressed issue of the loss of free energy component of the thermal energy that accompanies forced convection cooling, a process that has widespread use in the modern world. Active cooling is crucial in most modern technologies, ranging from microprocessors in data centers to turbines and engines. Forced convection cooling, which circulates a coolant fluid over the surface of a hot object, is effective for meeting such cooling requirements but demands a pumping power to send the coolant through the heat generating section. However, active cooling — fast removal of a large quantity of thermal energy in the heat source under a large temperature difference — promptly destroys the free-energy component of the thermal energy, which is an energy portion that can be converted to an electric work."</em> <a href="https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/news/2019/045723.html">[...]</a>

Infants, for instance, hold expectations for how objects should move and interact with each other, and will show surprise when they do something unexpected, such as disappearing in a sleight-of-hand magic trick. Now MIT researchers have designed a model that demonstrates an understanding of some basic “intuitive physics” about how objects should behave. The model could be used to help build smarter artificial intelligence and, in turn, provide information to help scientists understand infant cognition. The model, called ADEPT, observes objects moving around a scene and makes predictions about how the objects should behave, based on their underlying physics."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/adept-ai-machines-laws-physics-1202">[...]</a>

The board can drive 2 DC motors or a stepper motor with the help of dual H bridge circuit in the IC. SN754410 IC is being widely used for driving motors as it operates in wide range of voltage and can drive up to 1A current per channel. The additional thing here is the power switching circuit which will cut off the power to IC, this can be very power efficient than normal sleep modes. It needs an external signal from controller to turn ON the power to the driver circuit. The switching circuit is built around a couple of NPN transistors and a P channel MOSFET which will let the power flow only when we apply pulse to the circuit."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Power-Efficient-Motor-Driver-Board/">[...]</a>

It uses easy-to-acquire parts, but if you'd prefer to use a high-quality joystick, the design can accommodate for that too. Of course you could use this design for any application you like. This design is quite easy to make using easy to acquire parts, and the 3D printing doesn't need to be particularly good either.

It is capable of charging and desulfating/rejuvenating just about any rechargeable battery of any type, so long as the battery is not totally unrecoverable. For more info on Mikey's DA PIMP 2: mikeysklar.blogspot.com/p/da-pimp-battery-desulfator.html After eagerly waiting for Mikey to release DA PIMP 3 for a long while, I decided to design my own with a focus on safety and voltmeter accuracy and call it DIMP ("Desulfator In My Pocket") version 1. However, after communicating with some fans of DA PIMP 2, it seems that there is a preference for the all-in-one desulfator + voltmeter design of DA PIMP 1 and 2, so I have designed DIMP version 2 with an integrated voltmeter. Here are the differences between Mikey's DA PIMP 2 and my DIMP 2: Switched to four-digit LED display Rewrote voltmeter code on ATMEGA48V-10PU for four-digit display and improved accuracy at the low end Replaced rare Schurter rocker switch with commonplace OMRON A8L rocker switch Replaced dangerous jumper headers (used to select current output) with C&amp;K L202 slider switches Increased max power rating for R1 resistor Changed diode bridge from round to D3K rectangular package Reduced fuse cartridge size to 5mm x 15mm 2AG Reduced PCB width to 61mm to fit soap box case Increased PCB length to 97mm to fit the slider switches and extra display resistor Moved 9V battery so that it will fit better vertically under the soap box's domed lid Added J5 and J6 strain relief holes for 9V battery leads Added PCB mounting holes (J4 at top left is at 12.5mm,17.5mm from top left corner, J7 at bottom right is at -4.0mm,-4.0mm from bottom right corner) for 3D-printed housings with screw bosses DIMP 2 is sold on ebay as a PCB and pre-programmed ATMEGA48V-10PU for DIY assembly.

<p><em>"Take a $9 M5StickC, few lines of YAML configuration to build ESPHome, Home Assistant and start controlling your TVs and climates in minutes. In this project I document how I changed my Home Assistant setup replacing the Logitech Harmony Hub ($60) for a cheaper, smaller, and more versatile M5StickC ($9) with just ESPHome onboard and a few lines of YAML configuration. The ingredients are: A running Home Assistant instance (mine is hass.io on a RPi4) The SmartIR custom component An MQTT broker (mine is the mosquitto hassio addon) An M5StickC The configuration/source files of this project. Due to the great ability of the ESPHome lib/firmware for templatable actions, I was able to setup the remote_transmitter component to translate generic JSON inputs into IR codes to transmit with just 16 lines of ESPHome YAML config. So I built a firmware that acts as an MQTT->IR bridge, and that can run on a M5StickC (or a M5CameraF + grove IR transmitter), making it fully integrated with the smartir custom component of Home Assistant. In this way I can set up several "media_player" or "climate" entities, with just the list of codes they support as commands."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/alessandro-polselli/turn-m5stickc-into-universal-ir-remote-home-automation-d3ec0d">[...]</a>

In the last couple of years a lot of photovoltaic power station have been built, but usually they are using fix placement and thus the solar panels rarely receive the light in the optimal, 90 degree angle. I wanted to do some experiments on how I can create an inexpensive solar tracker solar panel while I can remotely control and monitor the results. Another issue I'd like to handle is the negative energy price at peak production hours.
