<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1774 - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Henry_(chemist)">William Henry</a>. Este Médico e químico inglês, em 1803, propôs a chamada lei de Henry, que afirma que a massa de um gás dissolvido por um determinado volume de solvente, a uma temperatura constante, é directamente proporcional à pressão do gás acima do líquido, desde que nenhuma ação química ocorra. A lei vale apenas para gases levemente solúveis a baixa pressão. Henry era amigo íntimo de John Dalton, mas, apesar das habilidades e alcance superiores como experimentador, não possuía a ousadia de Dalton como teórico, e Henry nunca se comprometeu com a teoria atómica.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1846, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugen_Baumann">Eugen Baumann</a>. Este químico alemão descobriu que a glândula tiróide era rica em iodo, um elemento antes desconhecido que ocorre naturalmente no tecido animal, tornando a glândula tiróide única por ser o único tecido a conter iodo. Isto levou à descoberta da hormona da tiróide contendo iodo e ao seu tratamento em distúrbios da tiróide.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1866, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Werner">Alfred Werner</a>. Este químico suíço ficou conhecido pela sua pesquisa inicial sobre a estrutura dos compostos de coordenação e deu-lhe o Prémio Nobel de Química de 1913. Ele demonstrou que a estereo-química não era apenas propriedade dos compostos de carbono, mas era geral para toda a química. A sua teoria da coordenação química (1893) reconheceu que muitos metais pareciam mostrar valência variável e formar compostos complexos. Certos metais, como o cobalto e a platina, foram capazes, por meio das suas valências secundárias, de se unirem a um certo número de átomos ou moléculas. Estes foram denominados por "compostos de coordenação" de Werner e o número máximo de átomos (ou "ligantes", como ele os chamava) que podem ser unidos ao metal central é o seu número de coordenação.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1900, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A1ria_Telkes">Mária Telkes</a>. Esta física húngaro-americana foi pioneira na aplicação de energia solar à destilação de água e aquecimento doméstico. Ela imigrou para os EUA em 1925, trabalhou como biofísica (1926-37) e naturalizou-se em 1937. Como consultora civil do Escritório de Pesquisa e Desenvolvimento Científico dos EUA durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial, ela elaborou um sistema de destilação de água aquecida por energia solar para tornar a água do mar potável. No final da década de 1940, ela projectou um sistema de armazenamento químico de energia solar para a primeira casa com aquecimento solar, um projecto do MIT construído em Dover, Massachusetts. Ela desenvolveu um fogão movido a energia solar e, na década de 1970, experimentou um sistema de ar condicionado que armazenava o ar fresco da noite para uso durante o calor do dia seguinte.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1927, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Noyce">Robert Noyce</a>. Este engenheiro e inventor americano que, com Jack Kilby foram responsáveis pela invenção do circuito integrado, um sistema de transístores interligados num único micro-chip de silício. Em 1957 co-fundou a Fairchild Semiconductor. Em 1968, ele e seu colega Gordon E. Moore foram co-fundadores da N.M. Electronics, que mais tarde seria renomeada para Intel Corporation.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou a Harbor Air e magniX anunciam o primeiro voo bem-sucedido do primeiro avião elétrico comercial do mundo. O voo bem-sucedido do ePlane, um DHC-2 de Havilland Beaver para seis passageiros, equipado com um sistema de propulsão magni500 de 750 cavalos de potência (560 kW), ocorreu no rio Fraser no terminal da Harbor Air Seaplanes em Richmond (YVR South). O avião foi pilotado pelo CEO e fundador da Harbor Air, Greg McDougall. Este vôo histórico significa o início da terceira era na aviação - a era da eletricidade.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou a Blue Origin lançou com sucesso a missão New Shepherd. Esta missão foi mais um passo no sentido de verificar que o New Shepard está preparado para voos espaciais humanos, à medida que continua a ser amadurecida a segurança e a confiança do veículo. Este foi o sexto voo para este veículo New Shepard em particular. A Blue Origin até agora reutilizou dois boosters cinco vezes cada um consecutivamente, sendo que hoje marca um recorde com este booster a completar o seu sexto voo para o espaço e de volta.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como alguns modelos 3D úteis. É apresentado o Livro "Earth at Night" pela NASA.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/about/media-center/press-item.html/n4214.html">Fully Integrated Power-Management IC from STMicroelectronics Saves Board Space, Bill of Materials, and Power Consumption</a></h2>

<p><em>"With features including four DC/DC buck converters, a boost DC/DC converter, and six low-dropout regulators (LDOs), the STMicroelectronics STPMIC1 power-management IC (PMIC) satisfies the complex power demands of highly integrated application-processor based systems. The chip is optimized as a companion PMIC for ST’s STM32MP1* heterogeneous multicore microprocessors, which target a broad range of applications by integrating single or dual Arm® Cortex®-A7 and Cortex-M4 cores, an optional 3D graphics processing unit, and rich digital and analog peripherals. More than simply saving board space and BOM cost, compared to arranging the same number of power rails using discrete components, the STPMIC1 also provides power-rail monitoring and protection, handles power-up/down sequencing, and meets the ST32MP1 accuracy and settling-time specifications. ST Authorized Partner Octavo Systems has utilized the STM32MP1 and STPMIC1 to create the OSD32MP1x family of microprocessor system-in-package (SiP) devices, which occupy a footprint up to 64% smaller than an equivalent system implemented with discrete components while also addressing engineering challenges such as power sequencing. Greg Sheridan, VP of Strategy at Octavo Systems commented, “The STPMIC1 is the perfect power-management solution for the OSD32MP1x family of system-in-package devices. With a single power input and 14 output rails including a 5V boost, it provides all the power needed for the STM32MP1 microprocessor while still providing plenty of options to power the rest of the system giving our SiP, which is packed in a tiny 18mm x 18mm package, the flexibility to support a wide range of applications.” In addition to supplying power rails for the microprocessor unit (MPU) and external system components, the STPMIC1 also provides a DDR memory reference voltage, a 500mA USB OTG power switch, and a general-purpose power switch."</em> <a href="https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/about/media-center/press-item.html/n4214.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"TSMC has been fast advancing its manufacturing processes. It is on track to move 5nm node to commercial production in the second half of 2020, and will soon break ground for a 3nm facility where volume production will start in 2022. Next year promises to be a fruitful one thanks to 5G picking up momentum, but in the meantime, Taiwanese IC desingers see orders slow down from Chinese clients who are conducting year-end inventory checks. But phone vendors are set to launch more 5G devices in 2020, including foldable ones. But vendors of such foldable phones have to make sure they receive sufficient supply for OLED panels. TSMC to kick off 3nm process manufacturing in 2022: TSMC is firmly on track to move 5nm process technology to commercial production in the first half of 2020 and will kick off production of chips built using a newer 3nm process node in 2022, according to JK Wang, the firm's senior vice president for fab operations."</em> <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20191206VL200.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A U.S. Naval Research Laboratory-built camera mounted on the NASA Parker Solar Probe revealed an asteroid dust trail that has eluded astronomers for decades. Karl Battams, a computational scientist in NRL’s Space Science Division, discussed the results from the camera called Wide-Field Imager for Solar Probe (WISPR) on Dec. 11 during a NASA press conference. WISPR enabled researchers to identify the dust cloud trailing the orbit of the asteroid 3200 Phaethon. “This is why NRL’s heliospheric imagers are so ground-breaking,” Battams said. “They allow you to see near-Sun outflows massively fainter than the Sun itself, which would otherwise blind our cameras."</em> <a href="https://www.nrl.navy.mil/news/releases/nrl-camera-aboard-nasa-spacecraft-confirms-asteroid-phenomenon">[...]</a>

<p><em>"After 18 months of planning, ICON and New Story just unveiled two affordable 3D-printed homes in a groundbreaking development for Tabasco, Mexico. In Tabasco, Mexico, a family living below the poverty line recently visited their future home: a 3D-printed, 500-square foot structure with two bedrooms, one bath, a wraparound cement patio, and an awning over the front porch. With an off-white exterior complimented by breeze blocks, the dwelling is earthen, compact, and even stylish. It’s one of two fully furnished homes—printed in about 24 hours and finished by local nonprofit ÉCHALE—that will soon make up a larger community of 50 dwellings with green spaces, parks, amenities, and basic utilities. Tabasco is a seismic zone, so the homes were engineered beyond standard safety requirements—and they’ll endure for generations. Through the development and design process, families selected to live in the new community—ones in utmost need—provided feedback to create homes that would best suit their lifestyles."</em> <a href="https://www.dwell.com/article/3d-printed-village-icon-new-story-tabasco-mexico-b76d0150">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news/intel-introduces-horse-ridge-enable-commercially-viable-quantum-computers/">Intel Introduces ‘Horse Ridge’ to Enable Commercially Viable Quantum Computers</a></h2>

<p><em>"Intel Labs today unveiled what is believed to be a first-of-its-kind cryogenic control chip — code-named “Horse Ridge” — that will speed up development of full-stack quantum computing systems. Horse Ridge will enable control of multiple quantum bits (qubits) and set a clear path toward scaling larger systems — a major milestone on the path to quantum practicality. Developed together with Intel’s research collaborators at QuTech, a partnership between TU Delft and TNO (Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research), Horse Ridge is fabricated using Intel’s 22nm FinFET technology. In-house fabrication of these control chips at Intel will dramatically accelerate the company’s ability to design, test and optimize a commercially viable quantum computer. “While there has been a lot of emphasis on the qubits themselves, the ability to control many qubits at the same time had been a challenge for the industry.

<p><em>"A novel experimental facility integrates automation and active learning, illuminating a path to accelerated scientific discovery. In its first year of operation, the Intelligent Towing Tank (ITT) conducted about 100,000 total experiments, essentially completing the equivalent of a PhD student’s five years’ worth of experiments in a matter of weeks. The automated experimental facility, developed in the MIT Sea Grant Hydrodynamics Laboratory, automatically and adaptively performs, analyzes, and designs experiments exploring vortex-induced vibrations (VIVs). Important for engineering offshore ocean structures like marine drilling risers that connect underwater oil wells to the surface, VIVs remain somewhat of a phenomenon to researchers due to the high number of parameters involved. Guided by active learning, the ITT conducts series of experiments wherein the parameters of each next experiment are selected by a computer. Using an “explore-and-exploit” methodology, the system dramatically reduces the number of experiments required to explore and map the complex forces governing VIVs."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/intelligent-towing-tank-propels-research-1209">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Newly synthesized compound of iron and tin atoms in 1-to-1 ratio displays unique behavior. Since 2016, a team of MIT researchers consisting of graduate students Linda Ye and Min Gu Kang, associate professor of physics Joseph G. Checkelsky, and Class of 1947 Career Development Assistant Professor of Physics Riccardo Comin has focused on exploring the electronic structure that arises when atoms of iron (Fe) and tin (Sn) combine in repeating patterns that look like Japanese kagome baskets, or the Star of David. The electronic behavior of these crystalline “kagome” structures varies with the ratio of iron to tin atoms, usually 3-to-2 or 3-to-1. Last year, the MIT team members and their colleagues reported that Fe3Sn2, a compound with a 3-to-2 ratio of iron to tin, generates Dirac fermions — a special kind of electronic state in which the spin of the electron and the orbit of the electron are coupled to each other. This special state of electron movement is protected by the topology, or geometric structure, of the crystal. Iron-tin compounds are of particular interest because the natural magnetism of iron atoms further affects their electronic behavior, in particular causing the spins of neighboring electrons to alternate in opposite directions (clockwise or counterclockwise), which is called antiferromagnetism."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/mit-researchers-realize-ideal-kagome-metal-electronic-structure-1212">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers solve decades-old challenge of building a functional transistor integrated with ferroelectric RAM A computer chip processes and stores information using two different devices. If engineers could combine these devices into one or put them next to each other, then there would be more space on a chip, making it faster and more powerful. Purdue University engineers have developed a way that the millions of tiny switches used to process information – called transistors – could also store that information as one device. The method, detailed in a paper published in Nature Electronics, accomplishes this by solving another problem: combining a transistor with higher-performing memory technology than is used in most computers, called ferroelectric RAM. Researchers have been trying for decades to integrate the two, but issues happen at the interface between a ferroelectric material and silicon, the semiconductor material that makes up transistors. Instead, ferroelectric RAM operates as a separate unit on-chip, limiting its potential to make computing much more efficient."</em> <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2019/Q4/reorganizing-a-computer-chip-transistors-can-now-both-process-and-store-information.html">[...]</a>

The innovation is a critical step in pushing the limits for researchers who want to explore large libraries of polymers, including plastics and fibers, for chemical and biological applications such as drugs and regenerative medicine through tissue engineering. While a human researcher may be able to make a few polymers a day, the new automated system – featuring custom software and a liquid-handling robot – can create up to 384 different polymers at once, a huge increase over current methods. Synthetic polymers are widely used in advanced materials with special properties, and their continued development is crucial to new technologies, according to a study in the journal Advanced Intelligent Systems. Such technologies include diagnostics, medical devices, electronics, sensors, robots and lighting. “Typically, researchers synthesize polymers in highly controlled environments, limiting the development of large libraries of complex materials,” said senior author Adam J.

Giving computers vision has helped us fight wildfires in California, understand complex and treacherous roads — and even see around corners. Specifically, seven years ago a group of MIT researchers created a new imaging system that used floors, doors, and walls as “mirrors” to understand information about scenes outside a normal line of sight. Using special lasers to produce recognizable 3D images, the work opened up a realm of possibilities in letting us better understand what we can’t see. Recently, a different group of scientists from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) has built off of this work, but this time with no special equipment needed: They developed a method that can reconstruct hidden video from just the subtle shadows and reflections on an observed pile of clutter."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/using-computers-view-unseen-computational-mirrors-mit-csail-1206">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A physicist at the University of California, Riverside, has performed calculations showing hollow spherical bubbles filled with a gas of positronium atoms are stable in liquid helium. The calculations take scientists a step closer to realizing a gamma-ray laser, which may have applications in medical imaging, spacecraft propulsion, and cancer treatment. Extremely short-lived and only briefly stable, positronium is a hydrogen-like atom and a mixture of matter and antimatter — specifically, bound states of electrons and their antiparticles called positrons. To create a gamma-ray laser beam, positronium needs to be in a state called a Bose-Einstein condensate — a collection of positronium atoms in the same quantum state, allowing for more interactions and gamma radiation. Such a condensate is the key ingredient of a gamma-ray laser. “My calculations show that a bubble in liquid helium containing a million atoms of positronium would have a number density six times that of ordinary air and would exist as a matter-antimatter Bose-Einstein condensate,” said Allen Mills, a professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy and sole author of the study that appears today in Physical Review A."</em> <a href="https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2019/12/05/gamma-ray-laser-moves-step-closer-reality">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In a surprising new study, University of California, Berkeley, researchers show that heat energy can travel through a complete vacuum thanks to invisible quantum fluctuations. To conduct the challenging experiment, the team engineered extremely thin silicon nitride membranes, which they fabricated in a dust-free clean room, and then used optic and electronic components to precisely control and monitor the temperature of the membranes when they were locked inside a vacuum chamber. (UC Berkeley photo by Violet Carter) If you use a vacuum-insulated thermos to help keep your coffee hot, you may know it’s a good insulator because heat energy has a hard time moving through empty space. Vibrations of atoms or molecules, which carry thermal energy, simply can’t travel if there are no atoms or molecules around. But a new study by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, shows how the weirdness of quantum mechanics can turn even this basic tenet of classical physics on its head. The study, appearing this week in the journal Nature, shows that heat energy can leap across a few hundred nanometers of a vacuum, thanks to a quantum mechanical phenomenon called the Casimir interaction."</em> <a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2019/12/11/heat-energy-leaps-through-empty-space-thanks-to-quantum-weirdness/">[...]</a>

Stretchy and squeezy soft sensors that can fit around body parts or squeezed in hands could be used for applications including sports and rehabilitation after injury or stroke. For example, soft electrical force sensors in the form for a squeeze ball could monitor the rehabilitation of patients with hand injuries or neurological disorders. While such sensors have been in development for a long time, none have made it to market because they cannot easily be integrated with electronic components, like the wires, computer chips and batteries needed to gather, process and send the data the sensor collects. Now, a team of researchers from Imperial have invented a way to bond the stretchy and squeezy force-sensitive soft materials to electrical components. They have developed a bond so strong that the stretchy rubber itself breaks before the bond between the two different materials does."</em> <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/194255/stretchy-squeezy-soft-sensors-step-closer/">[...]</a>

The proposed FM transmitter will allow combining a stereo input simultaneously from the source so that the info contained inside both the channels get into the air for an optimal reception. The stability of the transmitter is improved by tapping the antenna from one top turn of the coil as shown in the above circuit. This actually enhances the response of the circuits due to a couple of reasons. The antenna gets aloof from the collector of the transistor allowing it to function freely without unnecessary loading, and the slipping of the antenna to the top further allows the relevant side of the coil to get a higher stepped up voltage induced across itself and also the coil generating a higher concentration of transmission power on the antenna. Although this enhancement may not actual increase the range of the device, it makes sure that the circuit does not get rattled when hand held, or when the grip is encircled close over the circuit inside its enclosure."</em> <a href="http://electronics-diy.com/fm-music-transmitter.php">[...]</a>

After a quick Google Search i wasn't able to find anything like i wanted for a reasonable price, but i found a Audio Dial for only 15€ including Shipping on Ebay. I thought that for the price it was worth a try, even when there is no chance of changing the Audio control to something else, i at least will have a nice looking USB Knob with a metal Case and a Long micro USB Cable. After it arrive i first gave it a try on Controling the Audio on my PC and it worked nicely.
