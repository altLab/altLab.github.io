<p>Faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1706, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a>. Este estadista norte-americano, cientista, inventor, diplomata, autor, impressor e editor, tornou-se amplamente conhecido nos círculos científicos europeus pelos seus relatos de experiências e teorias eléctricas. Ele inventou um tipo de fogão, que ainda é fabricado, para dar mais calor do que lareiras, assim como o pára-raios. Ele usou óculos bi-focais que também foram suas ideias. Agarrando o fato de que pelo esforço conjunto uma comunidade pode ter amenidades que apenas os poucos ricos podem obter para si, ele ajudou a estabelecer instituições que as pessoas agora tomam como garantidas: uma empresa de bombeiros (1736), uma biblioteca (1731), uma companhia de seguros (1752). ), uma academia (1751) e um hospital (1751). Em alguns casos, essas fundações foram as primeiras desse tipo na América do Norte.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1781, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hare_(chemist)">Robert Hare</a>. Este Químico norte-americano inventou o primeiro maçarico de oxi-hidrogénio com o objectivo de produzir grande calor. Ele foi capaz de derreter quantidades consideráveis de platina com este maçarico. Mais tarde, descobriu-se que quando uma chama de maçarico agia num bloco de óxido de cálcio, uma luz branca brilhante resultava - o centro das atenções. O seu dispositivo também foi o pai dos modernos maçaricos de soldadura. Ele apresentou um artigo descrevendo a sua invenção em 10 de Dezembro de 1801 para a Chemical Society of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1889, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_H._Fowler">Ralph H. Fowler</a>. Este físico e astrónomo inglês cuja formação universitária em matemática o levou a trabalhar em termodinâmica e mecânica estatística, com importantes aplicações em físico-química. No campo da astronomia, ele colaborou com Arthur Milne nos espectros de estrelas e suas temperaturas e pressões. Ele também trabalhou na mecânica estatística de estrelas anãs brancas (1926) com P.A.M. Dirac, a quem ele tinha apresentado a teoria quântica. Fowler propôs que as estrelas anãs brancas consistem num gás degenerado de densidade extremamente alta.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que a China, através da sua sonda Chang'e 4 está a fazer experiências com sementes de algodão. Tendo tido algum sucesso inicial com a germinação das mesmas quando veio a noite lunar o frio matou as plantas. Estes pioneiros da fotossíntese fazem parte da experiência biológica da Chang'e 4, que também incluiu sementes de plantas de batata, entre outras, bem como ovos de mosca-das-frutas e leveduras. Estes organismos foram enviados num contentor de 2,6 kg, que aterrou com a Chang'e 4 na noite de 2 de Janeiro.</p>

<p>Também esta semana ficámos a saber que o CERN tem planos para construir um novo acelerador de partículas, designado por FCC - Future Circular Collider. Nos próximos dois anos, a comunidade da física de partículas estará a actualizar a Estratégia Europeia para a Física de Partículas, delineando o futuro da disciplina além do horizonte do LHC - Large Hadron Collider . O roteiro para o futuro deve, em particular, levar a escolhas cruciais para a pesquisa e desenvolvimento nos próximos anos, em última análise, com vista a construir o acelerador de partículas que sucederá o LHC e será capaz de ampliar significativamente o nosso conhecimento da matéria e do universo. O novo CDR contribui para a Estratégia Europeia. A possibilidade de um futuro colisor circular será examinada durante o processo de estratégia, juntamente com a outra opção de colisor pós-LHC no CERN, o colisor linear CLIC. “O objetivo final da FCC é fornecer um anel acelerador de protões supercondutor de 100 quilómetros, com uma energia de até 100 TeV, significando uma ordem de grandeza mais poderosa que o LHC”, disse o Director de Aceleradores e Tecnologia do CERN, Frédérick Bordry. “O cronograma da FCC prevê começar com uma máquina de electrões-positrões, assim como o LEP precedeu o LHC. Isso permitirá que um programa abundante beneficiasse a comunidade da física de partículas durante o século XXI ”.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker.</p>

<p><em>"The moon is a lifeless world once again. The cotton plants that sprouted on the moon's far side aboard China's Chang'e 4 lander are dead, done in by the bitter cold of the lengthy lunar night, GBTimes reported today (Jan. 16). These photosynthesizing pioneers were part of Chang'e 4's biological experiment, which also included seeds of potato, rapeseed and Arabidopsis plants, as well as fruit-fly eggs and yeast. These organisms were encased in a 5.7-lb. (2.6 kilograms) canister, which touched town on the lunar far side with the Chang'e 4 lander-rover duo on the night of Jan. 2.

<p><em>"Geneva. Today, the Future Circular Collider (FCC) collaboration submitted its Conceptual Design Report (CDR) for publication, a four-volume document that presents the different options for a large circular collider of the future. It showcases the great physics opportunities offered by machines of unprecedented energy and intensity and describes the technical challenges, cost and schedule for realisation. Over the next two years, the particle physics community will be updating the European Strategy for Particle Physics, outlining the future of the discipline beyond the horizon of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The roadmap for the future should, in particular, lead to crucial choices for research and development in the coming years, ultimately with a view to building the particle accelerator that will succeed the LHC and will be able to significantly expand our knowledge of matter and the universe. The new CDR contributes to the European Strategy."</em> <a href="https://home.cern/news/press-release/accelerators/international-collaboration-publishes-concept-design-post-lhc">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A periodic table chart discovered at the University of St Andrews is thought to be the oldest in the world. The chart of elements, dating from 1885, was discovered in the University’s School of Chemistry in 2014 by Dr Alan Aitken during a clear out. The storage area was full of chemicals, equipment and laboratory paraphernalia that had accumulated since the opening of the chemistry department at its current location in 1968. Following months of clearing and sorting the various materials a stash of rolled up teaching charts was discovered. Within the collection was a large, extremely fragile periodic table that flaked upon handling. Suggestions that the discovery may be the earliest surviving example of a classroom periodic table in the world meant the document required urgent attention to be authenticated, repaired and restored."</em> <a href="https://news.st-andrews.ac.uk/archive/worlds-oldest-periodic-table-chart-found-in-st-andrews/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A brief and unusual flash spotted in the night sky on June 16, 2018, puzzled astronomers and astrophysicists across the globe. The event - called AT2018cow and nicknamed "the Cow" after the coincidental final letters in its official name - is unlike any celestial outburst ever seen before, prompting multiple theories about its source. Over three days, the Cow produced a sudden explosion of light at least 10 times brighter than a typical supernova, and then it faded over the next few months. This unusual event occurred inside or near a star-forming galaxy known as CGCG 137-068, located about 200 million light-years away in the constellation Hercules. The Cow was first observed by the NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System telescope in Hawaii. So exactly what is the Cow?"</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7314">[...]</a>

<p><em>"STMicroelectronics is boosting feature integration in low-cost, low-power 8-bit microcontrollers (MCUs) with the new STM8L050. As the latest in the ultra-energy-conscious STM8L series, it embeds rich analog peripherals, a DMA controller, and separated data EEPROM, all in an inexpensive SO-8 package with up to six user I/Os. STMicroelectronics’ STM8L050 Extends Choice and Freedom in&amp;nbsp;8-bit Microcontrollers, with Rich Analog and DMA in Low-Cost 8-pin Package Leveraging ST’s powerful, efficient STM8 core running at up to 16 MHz, the STM8L050 delivers economy and performance for resource-constrained products like industrial sensors, toys, access cards, e-bike controllers, home-automation or lighting products, smart printer cartridges, or battery chargers. The integrated DMA (Direct Memory Access) controller speeds application performance by streamlining data transfers between peripherals and memory, or from memory to memory, ultimately saving power consumption. The 256 bytes of separated EEPROM allows applications to store important program data when the MCU is powered down, while allowing maximum utilization of Flash for code storage. Alongside two comparators, the STM8L050 has a 4-channel 12-bit analog-digital converter (ADC) and a low-power real-time clock (RTC) with programmable alarm and periodic wakeups, allowing designers to minimize external analog components."</em> <a href="https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/about/media-center/press-item.html/n3990.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Nearly 19 million acres of forests are destroyed annually, equal to 27 football pitches a minute. Forests serve as homes for thousands of animals, and for many people they’re a source of food, water, clothing, medicine and shelter. The so-called lungs of the Earth also mitigate climate change by acting as a carbon sink. And as cities expand and competition for space increases, managing vital green spaces is becoming increasingly important. To deepen our understanding of these complex ecosystems, 20tree.ai, a Portugal-based startup and member of the NVIDIA Inception program, is combining AI and satellite imagery. Their work allows for the monitoring of entire forests in a fraction of the time currently required."</em> <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2019/01/17/ai-for-smarter-forest-management/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"While diving into the Atlantic Ocean off the shores of North Carolina with his friends in 2010, Ian Burkhart, then a college student, sustained a devastating spinal cord injury that left him paralyzed from the chest down. But with a brain-computer interface powered by neural networks, he can now use his right hand to pick up objects, pour liquids and play Guitar Hero. Burkhart is the first participant in a clinical trial led by Ohio State University and Battelle, a nearby independent research and development organization. A Blackrock Microsystems microchip implanted in Burkhart’s brain connects to a computer running algorithms developed at Battelle. The algorithms interpret his neural activity and send signals to an electrode sleeve on his right hand. The sleeve, also invented at Battelle, stimulates the nerves and muscles in his arm to elicit a specific hand movement."</em> <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2019/01/16/neural-networks-restore-movement-paralyzed-limbs/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Over 1,400 years ago, Chinese people built the first known stone arch bridge in an epoch we do not readily think of as technological. Now, in an age when the prominence of technology cannot be denied, the glory of those bygone civil engineers has been recreated through 3D printing technology. Two 3D-printed bridges — the world’s largest 3D-printed concrete pedestrian bridge in Baoshan District and a resin bridge in Putuo District ­— have brought technology more widely used in education, medicine and the automobile industry into architecture and construction. The technique is much faster and cleaner than the alternatives. The bridges are both more durable and cheaper than conventional construction techniques, according to Xu Weiguo, an architecture professor with Tsinghua University, who built the Baoshan bridge. The 26.3-meter bridge across a canal in Wisdom Bay Innovation Park on the Wenzaobang River was completed on Saturday."</em> <a href="https://www.shine.cn/news/metro/1901148065/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The smallest building blocks within the power stations of organisms which get their energy directly from the sun are basically miniature reactors surrounded by collectors which capture photons and forward them to the centre. The close correlation between structure and interaction of the components boosts productivity, a strategy which an international team of researchers is using for increasing the efficiency of solar technology.

<h2><a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/catalog-atom-vacancy-2-d-materials-0114">Researchers catalog defects that give 2-D materials amazing properties</a></h2>

<p><em>"Theoretical analysis distinguishes observed “holes” from the huge list of hypothetically possible ones. Amid the frenzy of worldwide research on atomically thin materials like graphene, there is one area that has eluded any systematic analysis — even though this information could be crucial to a host of potential applications, including desalination, DNA sequencing, and devices for quantum communications and computation systems. That missing information has to do with the kinds of minuscule defects, or “holes,” that form in these 2-D sheets when some atoms are missing from the material’s crystal lattice. Now that problem has been solved by researchers at MIT, who have produced a catalog of the exact sizes and shapes of holes that would most likely be observed (as opposed to the many more that are theoretically possible) when a given number of atoms is removed from the atomic lattice. The results are described in the journal Nature Materials in a paper by graduate student Ananth Govind Rajan, professors of chemical engineering Daniel Blankschtein and Michael Strano, and four others at MIT, Lockheed Martin Space, and Oxford University. “It’s been a longstanding problem in the graphene field, what we call the isomer cataloging problem for nanopores,” Strano says."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/catalog-atom-vacancy-2-d-materials-0114">[...]</a>

During human evolution, the neocortex, the evolutionarily youngest part of the cerebral cortex, expanded dramatically and had to fold into wrinkles to fit inside the restricted space of the skull. The human neocortex supports advanced cognitive skills such as reasoning and language. But how did the human neocortex become so big? The answer may lie in genes that are unique to humans, such as ARHGAP11B.

As these defects move, they affect the internal electric environment within the cell.

<p><em>"By 2050, batteries based on lithium-ion will be the cheapest way to store electricity, such as from solar or wind farms, according to a new study. The new research calculates the cost of storing energy with different technologies, including large-scale batteries and pumped-storage hydroelectricity, and predicts those costs into the future. Based on this model, battery technologies based on lithium-ion are predicted to be the cheapest way of storing energy for most applications, such as making sure energy grids do not suffer large fluctuations and allowing consumers to manage their bills. These applications are particularly important in a world that relies more heavily on energy sources that may be intermittent – such as wind or solar power. The new study, published today in Joule by researchers at Imperial College London, could help industry and policymakers decide where to invest research and capital to make the best use of energy storage technologies. While previous studies of energy storage costs primarily focused on the investment costs only, the new study determines the ‘levelized cost of storage’ – the full costs of storing energy including investment, operation and charging cost, as well as technology lifetime, efficiency and performance degradation."</em> <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/189691/batteries-predicted-become-cheapest-option-storing/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Lithium-air batteries are poised to become the next revolutionary replacement for currently used lithium-ion batteries that power electric vehicles, cell phones and computers. Lithium-air batteries, which currently are still in the experimental stages of development, can store 10 times more energy than lithium-ion batteries, and they are much lighter. That said, lithium-air batteries could be even more efficient and provide more charge with the incorporation of advanced catalysts made from two-dimensional materials. Catalysts help increase the rate of chemical reactions inside batteries, and depending on the type of material from which the catalyst is made, they can help significantly boost the ability of the battery to hold and provide energy. “We are going to need very high-energy density batteries to power new advanced technologies that are incorporated into phones, laptops and especially electric vehicles,” said Amin Salehi-Khojin, associate professor of mechanical and industrial engineering in UIC’s College of Engineering.

<p><em>"Rather than building up plastic filaments layer by layer, a new approach to 3D printing lifts complex shapes from a vat of liquid at up to 100 times faster than conventional 3D printing processes, University of Michigan researchers have shown. 3D printing could change the game for relatively small manufacturing jobs, producing fewer than 10,000 identical items, because it would mean that the objects could be made without the need for a mold costing upwards of $10,000. But the most familiar form of 3D printing, which is sort of like building 3D objects with a series of 1D lines, hasn’t been able to fill that gap on typical production timescales of a week or two. “Using conventional approaches, that’s not really attainable unless you have hundreds of machines,” said Timothy Scott, an associate professor of chemical engineering at U-M, who co-led the development of the new 3D printing approach with Mark Burns, the T.C. Chang Professor of Engineering at U-M. Their method solidifies the liquid resin using two lights to control where the resin harden—and where it stays fluid. This enables the team to solidify the resin in more sophisticated patterns."</em> <a href="https://news.engin.umich.edu/2019/01/3d-printing-100-times-faster/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers at The University of Manchester’s National Graphene Institute in the UK have succeeded in making artificial channels just one atom in size for the first time. The new capillaries, which are very much like natural protein channels such as aquaporins, are small enough to block the flow of smallest ions like Na+ and Cl- but allow water to flow through freely. As well as improving our fundamental understanding of molecular transport at the atomic scale, and especially in biological systems, the structures could be ideal in desalination and filtration technologies. “Obviously, it is impossible to make capillaries smaller than one atom in size,” explains team leader Sir Andre Geim. “Our feat seemed nigh on impossible, even in hindsight, and it was difficult to imagine such tiny capillaries just a couple of years ago.” Naturally occurring protein channels, such as aquaporins, allow water to quickly permeate through them but block hydrated ions larger than around 7 A in size thanks to mechanisms like steric (size) exclusion and electrostatic repulsion. Researchers have been trying to make artificial capillaries that work just like their natural counterparts, but despite much progress in creating nanoscale pores and nanotubes, all such structures to date have still been much bigger than biological channels."</em> <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/atomic-scale-capillaries-block-smallest-ions-thanks-to-graphene/">[...]</a>

The keyboard is based on tactile pushbuttons that are available for under 6 pence/cents each. I decided to keep the board as compact as possible by providing only the keys needed to program in uLisp, which meant departing from a standard keyboard layout."</em> <a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2AEE">[...]</a>

This also comes with a DHT22 sensor, allowing for the sending of information made with the MQTT protocol.

Game save is by default and very handy."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Homemade-Odroid-go-Compatible-Game-Console/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A while ago i've made a custom desktop CNC mill. Since then i was upgrading it with new components. Last time i've added a second Arduino with 4 digit display to control RPM of my spindle using PID loop. I had to connect it with primary Arduino board with 5 wires, so they can communicate. But during my first test i broke a motor controller, so i've bought a new, more powerful one. It also had 5 more wires i had to connect."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/PCB-That-Helps-With-Cable-Management/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"IntroductionAs a beginner in electronics, you're pretty limited when it comes to powering your newly-fabricated circuits. Now, that would not be a problem if you make absolutely no mistakes. But, let's face it that it is a rarity. So, no matter whether you messed up a connection on the output side of your IC or you mix up the polarity of your capacitor something will get destroyed because your power supply will pump out the overcurrent according to it's set voltage no matter. What one solution to this problem is using a variable bench power supply with a current limit function so that we can prevent a big current flow when an error occurs but those are pretty expensive. Obviously, this is not usable when you create a battery powered project."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Over-Current-Protection/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This article goes over the design of firmware for a custom PCB project: a precision inclinometer subsystem. I recently designed a custom PCB with a muRata SCA103T-D04 inclinometer IC. My goal was to build a subsystem with truly ridiculous precision, able to accurately sense down to a thousandth of a degree of incline. This article will cover some highlights of how I designed the firmware for the board's MSP430 microcontroller to gather and process data from the IC.

The guests received a card with an RFID sticker on it along with their invitation. On the back of the card was written (in french) something like "This card is of great importance, keep it safe and carry it on you at the wedding". I didn't want them to know what it was for until the wedding.
