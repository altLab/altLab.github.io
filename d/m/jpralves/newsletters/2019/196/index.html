<p>Faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1769 - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9-Jacques_Garnerin">André-Jacques Garnerin</a>. Este Aeronauta francês foi o primeiro a usar um pára-quedas regularmente e com sucesso. Ele aperfeiçoou o pára-quedas e deu saltos de maiores altitudes do que era possível antes. Em 22 de Outubro de 1797, aos 28 anos, Garnerin fez o seu primeiro salto sobre o Parc Monceau, em Paris. Ele caiu de um balão de ar quente a 3000 pés. O seu pára-quedas, com 36 arcos e linhas, era semi-rígido, lembrando um pouco um guarda-chuva. A descida foi um sucesso, excepto que ele balançou para frente e para trás violentamente enquanto caía. O físico Lalande, que participou do evento, sugeriu melhorar o fluxo de ar com uma pequena abertura no topo do dossel.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1841, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Loyd">Sam Loyd</a>. Foi um criador americano de quebra-cabeças que era mais conhecido por compor problemas e jogos de xadrez, incluindo Parcheesi, além de outros jogos baseados em matemática e quebra-cabeças. Ele estudou engenharia e pretendia tornar-se um engenheiro mecânico, mas ganhou a vida com seus quebra-cabeças e problemas de xadrez. O enigma mais famoso de Loyd foi o Quebra-cabeça 14-15 que ele produziu em 1878. A mania varreu a América, onde os empregadores colocam avisos proibindo jogar o quebra-cabeça durante o expediente. O quebra-cabeça 15 de Loyd é o familiar arranjo de 4x4 de 15 quadrados numerados numa bandeja que deve ser reordenada, deslizando uma peça de cada vez no espaço vazio.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1868, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_William_Richards">Theodore William Richards</a>. Este Químico analítico norte-americano recebeu o Prémio Nobel de Química de 1914 "em reconhecimento das suas determinações precisas do peso atómico de um grande número de elementos químicos". O seu trabalho refinou meticulosamente os métodos clássicos de análise gravimétrica para melhor reduzir as fontes de erro. O seu trabalho e o de colegas de trabalho geraram valores precisos de peso atómico para mais de 60 elementos. Em 1913, ele descobriu que o peso atómico do chumbo comum diferia do chumbo produzido a partir do decaimento radioactivo do urânio e, portanto, concordava com a previsão de isótopos de Soddy. Os valores de Richard não melhoraram até que a espectrometria de massa se tornou disponível após a Segunda Guerra Mundial. Ele também realizou trabalhos em termo-química e electroquímica.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1881, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Langmuir">Irving Langmuir</a>. Este Químico e físico norte-americano fez estudos de filmes moleculares em superfícies sólidas e líquidas que abriram novos campos na pesquisa de colóides e bioquímica e lhe deram o Prémio Nobel de Química em 1932. Os seus primeiros trabalhos sobre gases levaram à invenção da bomba de condensação de Langmuir. Em 1913, Langmuir descobriu que a vida útil das lâmpadas de vácuo de tungsténio em uso poderia ser consideravelmente ampliada se fossem preenchidas com uma mistura de nitrogénio e árgon. Ele também desenvolveu um maçarico de soldagem com hidrogénio capaz de temperaturas de até 3.000 ° C, e fez o primeiro uso do termo plasma. Enquanto estudava a estrutura atómica, ele introduziu os termos covalência e electrovalência. Na química de superfície, ele trabalhou o fenómeno da absorção e a aplicação disso à catálise.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1929, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_M%C3%B6ssbauer">Rudolf Ludwig Mössbauer</a>. Este Físico alemão foi co-vencedor (com o americano Robert Hofstadter) do Prémio Nobel de Física em 1961 pelas suas pesquisas sobre a absorção de ressonância de raios gama e sua descoberta a respeito do efeito Mössbauer. O efeito Mössbauer ocorre quando os raios gama emitidos pelos núcleos dos isótopos radioactivos têm um comprimento de onda e frequência invariáveis. Isto ocorre se os núcleos emissores forem mantidos firmemente num cristal. Normalmente, a energia dos raios gama seria alterada por causa do recuo do núcleo irradiante. As descobertas de Mössbauer ajudaram a provar a teoria geral da relatividade de Einstein. As suas descobertas também são usadas para medir o campo magnético de núcleos atómicos e estudar outras propriedades de materiais sólidos.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1956, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum">Guido van Rossum</a>. Este  programador holandês ficou conhecido como o autor da linguagem de programação Python, pela qual ele foi o "ditador benevolente da vida" [BDFL]. Enquanto trabalhava no Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica (CWI), Van Rossum escreveu e contribuiu com uma rotina glob() para o BSD Unix e ajudou a desenvolver a linguagem de programação ABC. Ele também criou o Grail, um antigo navegador da Web escrito em Python, e envolvido em discussões sobre o padrão HTML. Em dezembro de 1989, Van Rossum estava a procura de um "hobby" projeto de programação que iria mantê-lo ocupado durante a semana em torno do Natal "como seu escritório foi fechado ele decidiu escrever um interpretador para uma" nova linguagem de script [ele tinha pensado ultimamente: um descendente de ABC que atraísse os hackers do Unix / C ". Ele atribui a escolha do nome "Python" a "estar com um humor ligeiramente irreverente (e um grande fã do Circo Voador de Monty Python)". Em Julho de 2018, Van Rossum anunciou que deixaria o cargo de BDFL da linguagem de programação Python.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou foi lançado o Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3+. Esta versão mais recente da placa Raspberry para aplicações industriais oferece mais de dez vezes o desempenho do ARM, duas vezes a capacidade de RAM e até oito vezes a capacidade de Flash do Compute Module original. O CM3+ é derivado da placa CM3, mas incorpora o design térmico aprimorado e o processador Broadcom BCM2837B0 da placa Raspberry Pi 3B+. Isto significa que, com excepção de um pequeno aumento na altura z, o CM3+ é um substituto directo do CM3 de uma perspectiva eléctrica e de tamanho. Observe-se que, devido às limitações da fonte de alimentação, a velocidade máxima do processador permanece em 1,2 GHz, em comparação com 1,4 GHz para o Raspberry Pi 3B+.</p>

<p>Também esta semana ficámos a conhecer a iniciativa de sustentabilidade da Volvo. Sabe-se que Um camião de lixo de plástico entra nos oceanos do mundo a cada minuto, e mais de metade da costa de Sydney é artificial. Habitats ricos e vibrantes foram substituídos por paredões e degradados pela poluição do plástico. Projectado para imitar a estrutura das raízes dos manguezais nativos, o Living Seawall adiciona complexidade à estrutura de paredão existente e fornece um habitat para a vida marinha. Isto ajuda a biodiversidade e atrai organismos filtradores que realmente absorvem e filtram poluentes - como as partículas e metais pesados - mantendo a água "limpa". Quanto mais organismos tivermos, mais limpa a água.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como um modelo 3D que poderá ser útil. São apresentadas as revistas newelectronics de 8 e 22 de Janeiro e a revista MagPI nº 78.</p>

<p><em>"Today we bring you the latest iteration of the Raspberry Pi Compute Module series: Compute Module 3+ (CM3+). This newest version of our flexible board for industrial applications offers over ten times the ARM performance, twice the RAM capacity, and up to eight times the Flash capacity of the original Compute Module. A long time ago… On 7 April 2014 we launched the original Compute Module (CM1), with a Broadcom BCM2835 application processor, a single-core ARM11 at 700MHz, 512MB of RAM, and 4GB of eMMC Flash. Although it seems like yesterday, that was nearly half a decade ago! At that point I had no kids, looked significantly younger (probably because I had no kids), and had more hair (fortunately I’m still better off in that department than Eben). [This is fair – Ed.]"</em> <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/compute-module-3-on-sale-now-from-25/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Our oceans are in distress One garbage truck of plastic enters the world’s oceans every minute, and more than half of Sydney’s shoreline is artificial. Rich, vibrant habitats have been replaced with seawalls and degraded by plastic pollution. The Volvo Ocean Race has been hosting beach clean-ups all over the world to help combat plastic pollution. But while they’re important, beach clean-ups alone aren’t enough to save our oceans. There’s so much plastic in the ocean that scientists say it’s simply not feasible to remove it all. Tearing down seawalls isn’t viable either."</em> <a href="https://www.volvocars.com/au/about/australia/living-seawall">[...]</a>

<p><em>"NASA's Curiosity rover has taken its last selfie on Vera Rubin Ridge and descended toward a clay region of Mount Sharp. The twisting ridge on Mars has been the rover's home for more than a year, providing scientists with new samples - and new questions - to puzzle over. On Dec. 15, Curiosity drilled its 19th sample at a location on the ridge called Rock Hall. On Jan. 15, the spacecraft used its Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) camera on the end of its robotic arm to take a series of 57 pictures, which were stitched together into this selfie. The "Rock Hall" drill hole is visible to the lower left of the rover; the scene is dustier than usual at this time of year due to a regional dust storm. Curiosity has been exploring the ridge since September of 2017."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7320">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-breaks-terabyte-threshold-for-smartphone-storage-with-industrys-first-1tb-embedded-universal-flash-storage">Samsung Breaks Terabyte Threshold for Smartphone Storage with Industry's First 1TB Embedded Universal Flash Storage</a></h2>

<p><em>"Powered by the company’s fifth-generation V-NAND, the new Universal Flash Storage offers 20x more storage than a 64GB internal memory and 10x the speed of a typical microSD card for data-intensive applications Samsung Electronics, the world leader in advanced memory technology, today announced that it has begun mass producing the industry’s first one-terabyte (TB) embedded Universal Flash Storage (eUFS) 2.1, for use in next-generation mobile applications. Just four years after introducing the first UFS solution, the 128-gigabyte (GB) eUFS, Samsung has passed the much-anticipated terabyte threshold in smartphone storage. Smartphone enthusiasts will soon be able to enjoy storage capacity comparable to a premium notebook PC, without having to pair their phones with additional memory cards. “The 1TB eUFS is expected to play a critical role in bringing a more notebook-like user experience to the next generation of mobile devices,” said Cheol Choi, executive vice president of Memory Sales &amp; Marketing at Samsung Electronics. “What’s more, Samsung is committed to assuring the most reliable supply chain and adequate production quantities to support the timely launches of upcoming flagship smartphones in accelerating growth of the global mobile market.” Within the same package size (11.5mm x 13.0mm), the 1TB eUFS solution doubles the capacity of the previous 512GB version by combining 16 stacked layers of Samsung’s most advanced 512-gigabit (Gb) V-NAND flash memory and a newly developed proprietary controller. Smartphone users will now be able to store 260 10-minute videos in 4K UHD (3840×2160) format, whereas the 64GB eUFS widely used in many current high-end smartphones is capable of storing 13 videos of the same size."</em> <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-breaks-terabyte-threshold-for-smartphone-storage-with-industrys-first-1tb-embedded-universal-flash-storage">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) today announced a new direction finding feature that holds the potential to significantly enhance the performance of Bluetooth location services solutions. The new feature allows devices to determine the direction of a Bluetooth signal, thereby enabling the development of Bluetooth proximity solutions that can understand device direction as well as Bluetooth positioning systems that can achieve down to centimeter-level location accuracy. Bluetooth location services solutions generally fall into two categories; proximity solutions and positioning systems. Today, proximity solutions use Bluetooth to understand when two devices are near each other, and approximately how far apart. They include item finding solutions such as personal property tags, as well as point-of-interest (PoI) information solutions like proximity marketing beacons. By including the new direction finding feature, Bluetooth proximity solutions can add device direction capability."</em> <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/news/pressreleases/2019/01/bluetooth-enhances-support-for-location-services-with-new-direction-finding-feature">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In search of stiffness-tunable materials that help increase the load capacity of soft robotic systems without sacrificing their compliance during robot-object interaction, thermally activated shape memory polymers (SMPs) stand out as a promising candidate. Not only are SMPs capable of reversibly changing stiffness by two to three orders of magnitude, they are also compatible with 3D printing. However, thus far it has been reported that SMP-based soft actuators generally suffer from limitations such as slow responses, small deformations and difficulties in automated fabrications with microfeatures. Researchers from the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) and Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) recently proposed a paradigm to use finite-element simulations and hybrid multimaterial 3D printing to design and manufacture fast-response, stiffness-tunable (FRST) soft actuators which are able to complete a softening-stiffening cycle within 32 seconds. “We combine a commercial inkjet multimaterial 3D printing technology with the direct-ink writing approach to fabricate our fully printed FRST actuator,” said Assistant Professor Qi (Kevin) Ge from SUTD’s Science and Math Cluster, who is one of the co-leaders of this project. “The stiffness tunability is provided by an embedded SMP layer, and the fast response is enabled by embedded heating and cooling elements.” In fact, the integration of the SMP layer into the actuator body enhances its stiffness by up to 120 times without sacrificing flexibility and adaptivity."</em> <a href="https://dmand.sutd.edu.sg/news-events/news/multimaterial-3d-printing-used-develop-fast-response-stiffness-tunable-soft-actuator/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In the Quest for Smaller, Faster 2D Processors, NYU Tandon-Led Research Team Invents Thermal Lithography Process for Higher Quality, Lower Cost, and Mass Production Potential An international team of researchers has reported a breakthrough in fabricating atom-thin processors — a discovery that could have far-reaching impacts on nanoscale chip production and in labs across the globe where scientists are exploring 2D materials for ever-smaller and -faster semiconductors. The team, headed by New York University Tandon School of Engineering Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering Elisa Riedo, outlined the research results in the latest issue of Nature Electronics. They demonstrate that lithography using a probe heated above 100 degrees Celsius outperformed standard methods for fabricating metal electrodes on 2D semiconductors such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS₂). Such transitional metals are among the materials that scientists believe may supplant silicon for atomically small chips. The team’s new fabrication method — called thermal scanning probe lithography (t-SPL) — offers a number of advantages over today’s electron beam lithography (EBL). First, thermal lithography significantly improves the quality of the 2D transistors, offsetting the Schottky barrier, which hampers the flow of electrons at the intersection of metal and the 2D substrate."</em> <a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/news/breakthrough-reported-fabricating-nanochips">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Small tweaks in component ratios generate electronically different layers from the same material to create transparent transistors. Worldwide demand is growing for transparent conducting oxides for use in solar cells, flat panel displays, smart windows and semiconductor-based consumer electronics. KAUST researchers have engineered a zinc-oxide-based transparent material that displays tunable electronic properties depending on the tweaking of a new type of dopant. Transparent electronics rely on indium tin oxide, a transparent and electrically conductive material that has an exorbitant cost due to the scarcity of indium. Zinc-oxide-based materials, such as hafnium-doped zinc-oxide materials, are expected to offer affordable, green and abundant alternatives to indium tin oxide. However, hafnium-doped zinc-oxide materials typically require high deposition temperatures and display inadequate performance for real-life device applications."</em> <a href="https://discovery.kaust.edu.sa/en/article/781/all-in-one-transparent-transistors">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers from Arizona State University, North Carolina State University and the University of North Carolina have developed an intelligent system for “tuning” powered prosthetic knees, allowing users to walk comfortably with the prosthetic device in minutes rather than hours. The system is the first to rely solely on reinforcement learning to tune a robotic prosthesis. Jennie Si, a professor in the School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering in ASU’s Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering, co-authored a paper released this week in the journal IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics. Using the reinforcement learning framework, Si developed the algorithm that essentially “teaches” a prosthetic device to adapt to a user’s normal walking gait using data collected from a suite of sensors in the device and the person’s natural walking pattern. Normally when someone receives a robotic prosthetic knee, a human practitioner works with them to modify a handful of parameters to specifically accommodate their walking gait. The process can take hours."</em> <a href="https://asunow.asu.edu/20190118-reinforcement-learning-steps-robotic-prosthetics-forward">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The field has narrowed in the race to protect sensitive electronic information from the threat of quantum computers, which one day could render many of our current encryption methods obsolete. As the latest step in its program to develop effective defenses, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has winnowed the group of potential encryption tools—known as cryptographic algorithms—down to a bracket of 26. These algorithms are the ones NIST mathematicians and computer scientists consider to be the strongest candidates submitted to its Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization project, whose goal is to create a set of standards for protecting electronic information from attack by the computers of both tomorrow and today. “These 26 algorithms are the ones we are considering for potential standardization, and for the next 12 months we are requesting that the cryptography community focus on analyzing their performance,” said NIST mathematician Dustin Moody. “We want to get better data on how they will perform in the real world.” Currently, the security of some cryptographic algorithms—which protect everything from online banking transactions to people’s online identities and private email messages—relies on the difficulty conventional computers have with factoring large numbers. Quantum computers are still in their infancy, but their design—which draws upon very different scientific concepts than conventional computers—may eventually enable them to factor these large numbers relatively quickly, revealing our secrets."</em> <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2019/01/nist-reveals-26-algorithms-advancing-post-quantum-crypto-semifinals">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://eng.snu.ac.kr/node/16695?language=en">Research Team Led by SNU College of Engineering Professor Jang Wook Choi Develops a Next Generation Aluminum Secondary Battery System</a></h2>

<p><em>"SNU College of Engineering announced on 10th that Professor Jang Wook Choi of the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering with Professor J. Fraser Stoddart from Northwestern University, the recipient of 2016 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, teamed up for a joint-research to develop the next generation aluminum secondary battery system. The recent wide use of electricity-based transportation like the electric car and drone has called for a high demand of secondary batteries. However, the price rise of lithium and transition metals used in commercialized lithium ion batteries has led to an increase of cost burden along with the rise of demand. To overcome this limitation, the research team focused on aluminum, which is a much more affordable material with greater capacity. However, one critical fallback of aluminum ion is that it destroys the structure of most oxides; thus, finding a suiting rechargeable bipolar substance is difficult. Hence, the team departed from the conventional oxides to turn toward stable organic substance that hosts aluminum complex ions."</em> <a href="https://eng.snu.ac.kr/node/16695?language=en">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The QUTIS group at the UPV/EHU has participated in a piece of international research together with the CSIC and the University of Ulm in Germany A piece of work involving international collaboration and the participation of the Quantum Technologies for Information Science (QUTIS) group of the UPV/EHU’s Department of Physical Chemistry, has produced a series of protocols for quantum sensors that could allow images to be obtained by means of the nuclear magnetic resonance of single biomolecules using a minimal amount of radiation. The results of the research have been published in the prestigious interdisciplinary physics journal Physical Review Letters. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is the technique behind a variety of applications, such as medical imaging, neuroscience or detection of drugs and explosives. With the help of quantum sensors, NMR has been adapted to work in the nanoscale regime, where it has both the potential to impact many disciplines, such as life sciences, biology, medicine, and to provide measurements of incomparable precision and sensitivity. In particular, “we expect that the combination of quantum sensors and dynamical decoupling techniques allows NMR imaging of single biomolecules” said the authors, among which are Dr. Jorge Casanova (Ikerbasque researcher) and Ikerbasque Professor Enrique Solano, at the Quantum Technologies for Information Science (QUTIS) group of the UPV/EHU’s Department of Physical Chemistry, as well as researchers of the CSIC, and the University of Ulm (Germany). This quantum-enhanced NMR “will be able to resolve chemical shifts in tiny picoliter samples, producing biosensors with unparalleled sensitivity and providing new insights into the structure, dynamics, and function of biomolecules and biological processes”, they added."</em> <a href="https://www.ehu.eus/en/-/erresonantzia-magnetikoaren-sentikortasuna-hobetzen-duten-sentsore-kuantikoak">[...]</a>

SNU College of Engineering (Dean Kook Heon Char) announced on 13th that research team led by Professor Yoon Young Kim of the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering has developed a new technology that greatly amplifies sensor signals by adding a pair of resonators to where the vibrational and ultrasonic wave sensors are attached. Conventional sensor signal amplification technology faced limitation as related researches narrowed themselves to only the sensor itself. However, Kim’s team led a paradigm shift to widen their view and use metamaterials to reduce the effective mechanical resistance around the sensor to hence amplify the signal. The team demonstrated with experiments that the signal of piezoelectric sensor, a sensor commonly used for measuring vibration and supersonic signals, can be amplified more than 300% using this newly-developed technology. The technology is expected to have a wide range of application beyond sensing like vibrational and ultrasonic excitation."</em> <a href="https://eng.snu.ac.kr/node/16697?language=en">[...]</a>

These transform environmental parameters into electrical signals that can be processed and measured with a computer. Due to their two-dimensional structure, graphene-based sensors are extremely sensitive and promise good performance at low manufacturing cost in the next years. To achieve this, graphene needs to make efficient electrical contacts when integrated with a conventional electronic circuit."</em> <a href="https://phys.org/news/2019-01-waterproof-graphene-electronic-circuits.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Even without a brain or a nervous system, the Venus flytrap appears to make sophisticated decisions about when to snap shut on potential prey, as well as to open when it has accidentally caught something it can’t eat. Researchers at the School of Engineering and Applied Science have taken inspiration from these sorts of systems. Using stimuli-responsive materials and geometric principles, they have designed structures that have “embodied logic.” Using multi-material 3D printers, the researchers can make these active structures with nested if/then logic gates, and can control the timing of each gate, allowing for complicated mechanical behaviors in response to simple changes in the environment. For example, by utilizing these principles an aquatic pollution-monitoring device could be designed to open and collect a sample only in the presence of an oil-based chemical and when the temperature is over a certain threshold. The Penn engineers published an open access study outlining their approach in the journal Nature Communications. The study was led by Jordan Raney, an assistant professor in Penn Engineering’s Department of Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics, and Yijie Jiang, a postdoctoral researcher in Raney’s lab."</em> <a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/engineers-3d-print-smart-objects-embodied-logic">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This Instructable will provide a step by step procedure for building a USB laptop keyboard controller. I created this guide and video to hopefully make it easier for people to re-purpose an old laptop. A typical laptop keyboard relies on the motherboard for the scanning circuitry. I use a Teensy microcontroller mounted on a connector board to take over this function. Teensies are often used by the mechanical keyboard enthusiasts at Geekhack and Deskthority and the TMK software is the most popular controller code. The TMK code is a bit of an overkill if you just want a simple USB keyboard but it will certainly provide all the features you could ever need."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-a-USB-Laptop-Keyboard-Controller/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.hackster.io/RolfK/self-balancing-robot-via-stepper-motor-0c61ca">Self Balancing Robot via Stepper Motor</a></h2>

<p><em>"With stepper motor via microstepping, digital motion processing, auto tuning via Twiddle Algorithmus, cascaded PID Controller I bought my first Arduino three years ago. I was fascinated by by the idea of a self-balancing-robot and this was my first project. I underestimated the difficulties, so the development took a long time. Many changes were necessary: The most important changes were: - Change from Arduino Mega to Arduino DUE - Change from direct-current-motor with encoder to stepper motor - Use of digital motion processing - MP 6500 stepper motor driver carrier Features of the Robot - Control of the robot via an Android Bluethoot App. - Stepper Motor, Unipolar/Bipolar, 200 Steps/Rev, 42×48mm, 4V, 1.2 A/Phase - Stepper Motor Driver Carrier can deliver up to 1.5 A per phase continuously, four different step resolutions: full-step, half-step, 1/4-step, and 1/8-step. - cascaded PID Controller for Motor and for Position - Task Dispatcher via Interrupt - PWM Controller - MPU-6050 sensor with accelerometer and gyro, using Digital Motion Processing with MPU-6050 - Auto Tuning via Twiddle Algorithmus - Battery Control - Software Design Object oriented - planned Step: drive in all diretcions Restrictions Running only at Arduino Due Stepper Motors I decided to use Stepper engines because they offer the following advantages: Exact positioning, no accumulated errors Holding torque in rest position No deceleration/lag due to the moment of inertia of the motor simple position sensing by counting PWM signal MPU-6050 Accelerometer + Gyro The MPU-6050 sensor contains a MEMS accelerometer and a MEMS gyro in a single chip."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/RolfK/self-balancing-robot-via-stepper-motor-0c61ca">[...]</a>

<p><em>"It's funny how the most random event can lead you on some multi-years quest. My passion for plotters started with such an event. My friend Alexandre had a broken desktop printer and, knowing my passion for dismantling things, proposed to give it to me. I spent a great evening marvelling at the inner complexity of such a common appliance, not knowing that it was the beginning of my passion for CNC machines. CNC machines (for Computer Numerical Control) are tools that transform bits into atoms. I spend the following summer self-teaching practical electronics with my Friend Sebastian (who went on working at Festo), to be able, by myself, to build some."</em> <a href="https://www.benjaminpoilve.com/projects/plotter-story.html">[...]</a>
