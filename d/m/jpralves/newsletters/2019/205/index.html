<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1821, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Yale_Jr.">Linus Yale Jr.</a>. Este inventor norte-americano e fabricante de fechaduras, ficou conhecido pela sua invenção da fechadura de cilindro conhecida por seu nome. O seu primeiro negócio de fechaduras, estabelecido em Shelburne Falls, Massachusetts (início da década de 1840), começou com a produção de fechaduras bancárias, como a Yale Infallible Bank Lock (1851). Ele introduziu o bloqueio de combinação (c.1862). O seu conhecimento especializado deu-lhe fama por poder abrir as fechaduras "invioláveis" dos seus concorrentes. Ele patenteou pela primeira vez a fechadura da porta do cilindro do tambor em 1861. O seu modelo aprimorado de 1865 continua a ser um projecto seguro usado nas fechaduras de Yale de hoje. Ele começou a produção em massa deste tipo de tranca, e com parceiros, fundou a Yale Lock Manufacturing Co. no último ano de sua vida (1868).</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1823, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Wilhelm_Siemens">Carl Wilhelm Siemens</a>. Este engenheiro e inventor germano-inglês inventou o “sistema regenerativo” de uso de gases residuais para pré-aquecer gases combustíveis, para o forno aberto usado na fabricação de aço. Ele também foi importante na indústria telegráfica, pioneira no cabo submarino. Ele ajudou na engenharia da linha telegráfica de Londres-Calcutá (1869), uma conquista marcante nas comunicações. O seu nome no nascimento foi Carl Wilhelm Siemens, o irmão mais novo de Ernst Werner Siemens (mais tarde conhecido como Werner von Siemens, que fundou o que hoje é a multinacional Siemens). Carl visitou pela primeira vez a Inglaterra como agente de seu irmão para introduzir um dispositivo de eletrodeposição.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1846, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Pictet">Raoul Pictet</a>. Este químico suíço foi pioneiro da criogenia. O seu interesse original era a produção artificial de gelo (para refrigeração) e levou-o a estudar a produção de temperaturas extremamente baixas. Ele produziu oxigénio líquido, trabalhando independentemente do cientista francês Louis Paul Cailletet, que também é creditado com sua descoberta em 1877. No entanto, Pictet usou equipamentos mais elaborados e foi capaz de produzir maiores volumes de gases liquefeitos. Pictet usou um método em cascata, no qual ele evaporou o dióxido de enxofre líquido para liquefazer o dióxido de carbono, que por sua vez era permitido evaporar e arrefecer o oxigénio abaixo de sua temperatura crítica. O oxigénio pode então ser liquefeito por pressão. Isto também foi mais fácil de aplicar a outros gases.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1949, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shing-Tung_Yau">Shing-Tung Yau</a>. Este matemático nascido na China recebeu a Medalha Fields em 1982 pelo seu trabalho em equações diferenciais parciais e geometria diferencial. O seu trabalho também tem aplicações em topologia, geometria algébrica, teoria de representação e relatividade geral. Trabalhando em colaboração com Richard M. Schoen, Yau resolveu um problema em aberto de longa data na teoria da relatividade, mostrando a positividade da massa no espaço-tempo. Como consequência, Schoen e Yau foram capazes de dar a primeira demonstração rigorosa de como os buracos negros podem ser formados por causa da condensação da matéria. Um buraco negro possui um campo gravitacional tão forte que nenhuma matéria ou radiação pode escapar a ele.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1950, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Sasson">Steven Sasson</a>. Este engenheiro electrotécnico e inventor norte-americano construiu a primeira câmara digital enquanto trabalhava na Kodak. O seu supervisor pediu que ele explorasse a aplicação de um dispositivo electrónico de carga acoplada (CCD) como um sensor de imagem numa câmara. O protótipo experimental que ele construiu era do tamanho de uma torradeira e pesava quase 4 quilos. Ela tirou a primeira foto digital em Dezembro de 1975, convertendo a imagem num sinal electrónico que foi digitalizado e armazenado numa fita de cassete. Mantendo-se concentrada no tradicional filme fotográfico de celulóide que há muito tempo era o negócio gigantesco da Kodak, só em 1996 é que a empresa começou a vender câmaras digitais no mercado. Infelizmente para a empresa, ela não foi apenas eclipsada por outros fabricantes de câmaras digitais, mas a mudança tecnológica destruiu o seu negócio de filmes fotográficos, apesar de ter acumulado 1.000 patentes de imagens digitais.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que a Amazon tenciona lançar para o espaço cerca de 3,236 satélites para criar uma rede que possibilite disponibilizar uma rede Internet de alta velocidade global. Conhecido como Project Kuiper, o movimento representa a mais recente ambição espacial de Jeff Bezos.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. É apresentada a revista micro:mag nº4.</p>

<p><em>"Similar to our computers which handle electrons to perform the calculations and logics, all the circuitry in living beings is based on the transport of ions, such as sodium, chloride, calcium, etc. Nature exploits incredibly subtle transport of these elementary charges and an artillery of ion channels to perform advanced functions by manipulating the - often exotic - behaviour of ion transport at molecular scales. Achieving such features in artificial channels remains a considerable challenge. As published in Nature, Researchers from the Micromegas team at the Physics Department at ENS, Paris in collaboration with the Condensed Matter Physics laboratory and National Graphene Institute at The University of Manchester, have been able to highlight mechano-sensitive properties of ion transport in few angstroms thick artificial channels. Just over two years ago, Manchester researchers led by Dr Radha Boya and Prof Sir Andre Geim showed that by stacking two-dimensional atomic layers similar to stacking bricks of Lego, it is indeed possible to assemble molecular and smooth channels at the atomic scale in a controlled manner. The atomic layers used for building the channel are held together by so-called van der Waals forces."</em> <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/controlling-pressure-driven-ionic-flow-by-voltage-at-molecular-scale/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Paper-based diagnostic tests are cheap, convenient and biodegradable. However, their use is limited by conventional dyes—which are not bright enough to show trace amounts of analyte, are prone to fading, and can be environmentally toxic. Now researchers are using quantum physics to overcome these limitations, says a review published in Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology. The bizarre optical properties of tiny metal particles—smaller than light waves—can be captured on paper to detect even a single target molecule in a test sample. These hyper-sensitive testing devices could be assembled and customized at the point of use in low-resource environments, with virtually limitless applications spanning medicine, forensics, manufacturing and environmental safety. "A new generation of paper-based analytical devices is being developed, which use metal nanoparticles for analyte identification," says lead author Dr. Eden Morales-Narváez of the Center for Optics Research in Mexico."</em> <a href="https://phys.org/news/2019-03-quantum-physics-origami-ultimate-get-well.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/engineers-demonstrate-lighter-flexible-airplane-wing-0401">MIT and NASA engineers demonstrate a new kind of airplane wing</a></h2>

<p><em>"Assembled from tiny identical pieces, the wing could enable lighter, more energy-efficient aircraft designs. A team of engineers has built and tested a radically new kind of airplane wing, assembled from hundreds of tiny identical pieces. The wing can change shape to control the plane’s flight, and could provide a significant boost in aircraft production, flight, and maintenance efficiency, the researchers say. The new approach to wing construction could afford greater flexibility in the design and manufacturing of future aircraft. The new wing design was tested in a NASA wind tunnel and is described today in a paper in the journal Smart Materials and Structures, co-authored by research engineer Nicholas Cramer at NASA Ames in California; MIT alumnus Kenneth Cheung SM ’07 PhD ’12, now at NASA Ames; Benjamin Jenett, a graduate student in MIT’s Center for Bits and Atoms; and eight others. Instead of requiring separate movable surfaces such as ailerons to control the roll and pitch of the plane, as conventional wings do, the new assembly system makes it possible to deform the whole wing, or parts of it, by incorporating a mix of stiff and flexible components in its structure."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/engineers-demonstrate-lighter-flexible-airplane-wing-0401">[...]</a>

<p><em>"If you look under the hood of the internet, you’ll find lots of gears churning along that make it all possible. For example, take a company like AT&amp;T. They have to intimately understand what internet data is going where so that they can better accommodate different levels of usage. But it isn’t practical to precisely monitor every packet of data, because companies simply don’t have unlimited amounts of storage space. (Researchers actually call this the “Britney Spears problem,” named for search engines’ long-running efforts to tally trending topics.) Because of this issue, tech companies use special algorithms to roughly estimate the amount of traffic heading to different IP addresses."</em> <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/news/using-machine-learning-make-better-estimations">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In order to make autonomous cars navigate more safely in difficult conditions – like icy roads – researchers are developing new control systems that learn from real-world driving experiences while leveraging insights from physics. Researchers at Stanford University have developed a new way of controlling autonomous cars that integrates prior driving experiences – a system that will help the cars perform more safely in extreme and unknown circumstances. Tested at the limits of friction on a racetrack using Niki, Stanford’s autonomous Volkswagen GTI, and Shelley, Stanford’s autonomous Audi TTS, the system performed about as well as an existing autonomous control system and an experienced racecar driver. “Our work is motivated by safety, and we want autonomous vehicles to work in many scenarios, from normal driving on high-friction asphalt to fast, low-friction driving in ice and snow,” said Nathan Spielberg, a graduate student in mechanical engineering at Stanford and lead author of the paper about this research, published March 27 in Science Robotics. “We want our algorithms to be as good as the best skilled drivers – and, hopefully, better.” While current autonomous cars might rely on in-the-moment evaluations of their environment, the control system these researchers designed incorporates data from recent maneuvers and past driving experiences – including trips Niki took around an icy test track near the Arctic Circle. Its ability to learn from the past could prove particularly powerful, given the abundance of autonomous car data researchers are producing in the process of developing these vehicles."</em> <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2019/03/27/autonomous-driving-unknown/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The electrical energy from batteries powers not only the ignition system that turns the engine and moves electric vehicles but also powers almost every sensing feature of today’s automobiles. Electricity turns on the car headlights for night travel, rolls the windows up and down, senses numerous actions within the car to keep drivers aware and alert to their environment. Today’s autos come with many sensors – “door ajar”, “seatbelt not fastened”, “low tire pressure”, “engine rpm’s”, “obstacle proximity”, etc. Newer autonomous sensors can even alert the engine to slow down and stop if the driver is inattentive or incapacitated. Each sensor requires just a little bit of energy from the car’s battery, but all those little bits add up; and, as the industry begins to focus more on electric vehicles, networked vehicles, and passenger infotainment features, the number of sensors may increase significantly. To deal with the problem of battery depletion, UF Engineers have developed a new type of sensor that creates its own energy, extending battery life of automobiles."</em> <a href="https://www.eng.ufl.edu/newengineer/news/tiny-sensors-big-potential/">[...]</a>

The rise of energy consumption in recent decades has led to an increasing demand for renewable energy and energy-saving systems. In response to this growing worldwide need, researchers have developed a more efficient and effective smart window that can block the flow of light and heat as required. The study, which was led by Dr Behnam Akhavan from The Applied Plasma and Surface Engineering Research Group, focused on responding to the rise of energy consumption by using thin plasma fabricated coatings which were applied to glass windows. The new technology consists of electrochromic coatings made of transparent materials that darken in colour with the application of a small electrical voltage. Produced for the first time using a new plasma sputtering technology, the coatings are made up of a layer of silver that is approximately 10,000 times thinner than the width of human hair, placed in between two nano-thin layers of tungsten oxide."</em> <a href="https://sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2019/04/01/new-plasma-technology-creates--smart--windows.html">[...]</a>

MIT researchers have designed a novel flash-storage system that could cut in half the energy and physical space required for one of the most expensive components of data centers: data storage. Data centers are server farms that facilitate communication between users and web services, and are some of the most energy-consuming facilities in the world. In them, thousands of power-hungry servers store user data, and separate servers run app services that access that data.

But another challenge may have an even greater impact on someone’s daily life: Often, stroke survivors lose sensation and muscle control in one arm and hand, making it difficult to dress and feed themselves or handle everyday objects such as a toothbrush or door handle. Now, doctors and engineers at Stanford and Georgia Tech are working on a novel therapy that could help more stroke survivors regain the ability to control their arms and hands – a vibrating glove that gently stimulates the wearer’s hand for several hours a day.

<p><em>"Texas A&amp;M University researchers are looking to nature for inspiration in developing a new method of underwater plasma generation using shrimp as a model – a discovery which could provide significant improvements for actions ranging from water sterilization to drilling. Dr. David Staack, associate professor in the J. Mike Walker '66 Department of Mechanical Engineering, and Xin Tang, a Ph.D. candidate and graduate research assistant in the department, used 3D printing technology to replicate not only the physical shape of a snapping shrimp's claw, but also the complex mechanism through which it generates plasma. The team’s research was published March 15 in the online journal Science Advances. "Generally, when you look to nature, evolutionary pressure makes it so that nature is very efficient at doing things," Staack said. "I find it interesting that the shrimp has been doing intense shock waves, plasma chemistry and nanoparticle synthesis for millions of years." When the snapping shrimp – also known as the pistol shrimp – snaps its claw, it shoots out a jet of water fast enough to generate a bubble which, when it collapses, creates a loud noise and emits light."</em> <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/news/2019/03/shrimp-claw-inspires-new-method-of-underwater-plasma-generation.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A few weeks ago I received a last minute invite to participate in a PhabLabs Hackathon at Science Centre Delft in the Netherlands. For an enthusiastic hobbyist like me, who can normally spend only a limited amount of time on tinkering, I saw this as a great opportunity to schedule some dedicated time to turn one of my many ideas, within the scope of the Hackathon: Photonics, into an actual project. And with the great facilities in the Makerspace at Science Centre Delft it was just impossible to turn down this invite. One of the ideas I already had for a while related to photonics was that I wanted to do something with Persistence of Vision (POV). There are already tons of examples available online of how to build a basic POV display using some basic components: microcontroller, old fan/hard disk/motor and one string of leds connected perpendicular to the axis of the rotating device. With a relatively simple setup you can already create an impressive 2 dimensional image, e.g."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Transparent-3D-Volumetric-POV/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This project started all the way back when I was in 6th grade and completely new to electronics, when I thought to myself, "Hey, let's build a drone....it shouldn't be that hard......right?" Yea, guess what, it's hard. Almost 4 years later, this project is coming to a close, and along the way, I have built my engineering knowledge from the ground up, and I will be sharing my knowledge with everyone in the Instructables community so that if another 6th grader were to find themselves upon this Instructable, I hope they will not spend nearly as much time trying to build a drone, but still acquire the same knowledge that I have. This drone tutorial go cover how I built my drone as well as go deep into the nitty-gritty aspects from the construction of the frame all the way to the code. I hope that by reading this instructable, you will be able to fully understand and admire the concepts and theory behind quadcopter building. I would like to thank and recommend some Youtube channels that I have watched and learned from which helped arm me with the knowledge that I have today: - Joop Brokking: https://www.youtube.com/user/MacPuffdog (He has an AMAZING playlist for drone building) - Great Scott: https://www.youtube.com/user/greatscottlab (Great electronics information) - Electronoobs: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjiVhIvGmRZixSzup...

<p><em>"A solder reflow oven is a very useful piece of equipment for boards with a large quantity of surface mount components or making batches of surface mount boards. The reason that I made this was because I had to make several boards containing around twenty parts each. It was too much of a pain to try and solder them by hand, considering all I own is a convention soldering iron. Looking around I saw that actual solder ovens were out of my budget, so I ended up modifying a twenty dollar toaster oven from Amazon. All in all this cost me about $50 to make, and I was able to use parts that I already had sitting around. It made my life much easier to be able to use the oven to do the soldering instead of a traditional iron."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Sub-100-Solder-Reflow-Oven/">[...]</a>

Today, we will take a look on how to build a cheap version of one of the most important tools for any electronics engineer or maker; The Oscilloscope. The Oscilloscope is a test instrument used for the visualization and observation of varying signal voltages, usually as a two-dimensional plot with one or more signals plotted against time. They are used in the design and debugging of electronic devices to view and compare waveforms, determine voltage levels, frequency, noise and other parameters of signals applied at its input as it changes with time. This makes Oscilloscopes a very important tool on the desk of an electronics engineer or maker. However, Oscilloscopes are quite expensive, they cost between $45 – $100 for a small oscilloscope and above $300 for advanced oscilloscopes, which puts them beyond the reach of basic users."</em> <a href="http://www.electronics-lab.com/project/hs101-high-quality-cheap-diy-oscilloscope/">[...]</a>
