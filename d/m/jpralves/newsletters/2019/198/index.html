<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1793, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldsworthy_Gurney">Goldsworthy Gurney</a>. Este inventor inglês construiu carruagens a vapor tecnicamente bem sucedidas meio século antes do advento do automóvel movido a gasolina. A sua carruagem viajou com sucesso entre Londres e Bath a uma velocidade média de 24 km/h. Outra de suas invenções foi o "Bude Light", que acendeu a Câmara dos Comuns por 60 anos. Era uma lâmpada de óleo comum com gás de oxigénio introduzido no meio da chama. O carbono não queimado na chama de óleo queimava com uma luz branca intensa, em vez da fraca chama amarela da lâmpada de óleo. Ele também introduziu o uso dos holofotes nos faróis.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1819, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Latham_Sholes">Christopher Latham Sholes</a>. Este inventor norte-americano desenvolveu a máquina de escrever. Como editor de jornais e revistas, ele desenvolveu uma máquina de numeração de páginas em meados do século XIX. Um amigo sugeriu que ele modificasse a máquina para um dispositivo de impressão de cartas. Sholes patenteou a máquina de escrever em 1868 e em 1873 vendeu os direitos à Remington.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1838, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_E._Knight">Margaret E. Knight</a>. Este Inventor norte-americano de máquinas e mecanismos para uma variedade de fins industriais e todos os dias. Ela criou, mas não patenteou, a sua primeira invenção aos 12 anos, um dispositivo de segurança de corte que desligava automaticamente um tear quando a ponta de aço do carreto caía. A sua primeira patente foi em 1870, quando ela inventou uma máquina para fazer sacos de papel de fundo quadrado, uma melhoria em relação aos sacos em forma de V. As 27 patentes que ela possuía para invenções incluíam um escudo de saia e vestido (1883), um fecho para vestimentas (1884), um espeto (1885) e até uma nova manga de válvula para um motor automático. Ela também recebeu seis patentes ao longo de anos para máquinas usadas na fabricação de calçado. Ela nunca se casou e o seu génio criativo nunca a deixou rica. Como uma mulher da classe trabalhadora auto-suficiente, ela raramente tinha sido capaz de esperar por royalties, mas vendeu os direitos de suas invenções directamente. Embora ela não tenha sido a primeira mulher a receber uma patente, ela foi uma das mais prolíficas.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1839, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Hankel">Hermann Hankel</a>. Este matemático alemão trabalhou na teoria dos números complexos, a teoria das funções e a história da matemática. Na sua educação na Universidade de Leipzig, ele aprendeu física com seu pai, Wilhelm Gottlieb Hankel. Ele estudou matemática lá ensinada por August Möbius, seguido por um ano em Göttingen com Bernhard Riemann e depois completou o seu doutorado em Berlim sob Karl Weierstrass e Leopold Kronecker. Embora tenha morrido tão jovem, aos 34 anos, deixou um legado da transformada de Hankel e da matriz de Hankel. Os escritos que ele deixou estavam às vezes cheios de erros, e outras vezes mostravam compreensão, especialmente sobre o trabalho de Hermann Grassman para o cálculo de vectores e o trabalho sobre séries infinitas de Bernard Bolzano.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1859, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_Gale_Ferris_Jr.">George Washington Gale Ferris Jr.</a>. Este engenheiro e inventor norte-americano inventou a gigantesca roda de observação para a Exposição Mundial de Colombo, Chicago, Illinois (1893), criada para rivalizar com a Torre Eiffel, construída por Gustave Eiffel para o mundo de 1889. Feira em Paris. Ferris começou como engenheiro de construção em projectos de túneis rodoviários e pontes ferroviárias, e mais tarde estabeleceu seu próprio negócio como Ferris &amp; Company. A sua idéia audaciosa para a roda de observação gastou US $ 400 mil do seu dinheiro para financiamento, mas sua construção foi adiada para que a sua abertura em 21 de Junho de 1893 fosse mais de um mês após a abertura da Exposição.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1869, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Thomson_Rees_Wilson">Charles Thomson Rees Wilson</a>. Este físico escocês dividiu (com Arthur H. Compton) o Prémio Nobel de Física de 1927 pela sua invenção da câmara nebulosa de Wilson, que se tornou amplamente usada no estudo da radioactividade, raios X, raios cósmicos e outros fenómenos nucleares. A sua descoberta foi um método de tornar visíveis os rastos dessas partículas electricamente carregadas. Baseia-se na formação de nuvens, que se desenvolvem quando o ar suficientemente húmido é subitamente expandido, reduzindo assim a temperatura abaixo do ponto de condensação. Após esse momento, o vapor condensa-se em pequenas gotas, formando partículas de poeira redondas ou, até mesmo, uma partícula atómica carregada electricamente. A formação de gotículas é tão densa que as fotografias mostram rastos contínuos de partículas que viajam através da câmara como linhas brancas.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1877, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenleaf_Whittier_Pickard">Greenleaf Whittier Pickard</a>. Este engenheiro electrotécnico norte-americano inventou o detector de cristal que foi um dos primeiros dispositivos amplamente utilizados para receber transmissões de rádio (um componente chave, até ser substituído pelo tubo de vácuo triodo, e depois pelo transístor). A sua patente de 20 de novembro de 1906 descreveu-a como "um meio de receber inteligência comunicada por ondas eléctricas". Ele também foi um dos primeiros cientistas a demonstrar a transmissão electromagnética da fala sem fio. Em 1899, ele transmitiu uma mensagem falada a uma distância de dezasseis quilómetros. Pickard conduziu numerosas experiências para determinar o efeito do Sol e das manchas solares no rádio. No seu estudo sobre a polarização das ondas de rádio, ele contribuiu para o desenvolvimento do localizador de direcção e observou, já em 1908, que erros na leitura de bússolas de rádio poderiam ser causados por construções, árvores e outros objetos.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1878, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Nieuwland">Julius Arthur Nieuwland</a>. Este Químico orgânico belga-americano estudou reacções de acetileno e inventou o neoprene. Ele foi ordenado sacerdote (1903) antes de receber seu Ph.D. (1904). Ele não seguiu a sua própria descoberta da reacção entre o acetileno e o tricloreto de arsénio, mas levou ao desenvolvimento do agente de guerra química lewisite apelidado de "o orvalho da morte", um gás venenoso e vesicante usado na Primeira Guerra Mundial. Ele colaborou com Químicos da DuPont na polimerização de acetileno e desenvolvimento de cloropreno, que por sua vez poderia ser polimerizado para a primeira borracha sintética de sucesso - o neoprene. Isto foi superior à borracha em muitos aspectos, como na sua resistência à luz solar, abrasão e temperaturas extremas.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1898, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Zwicky">Fritz Zwicky</a>. Este astrónomo e físico suíço-americano propôs a existência da matéria escura responsável pelo universo de massa adicional no universo. O seu trabalho em supernovas produziu uma melhor compreensão teórica dessas estrelas infrequentes que têm um brilho excepcional por um curto período de tempo. A sua carreira incluiu contribuições para a propulsão a jato e a física de cristais, líquidos e gases, mas ele é mais conhecido pela astrofísica. Ele procurou por supernovas e calculou a sua frequência tão rara quanto uma por milénio por galáxia tipica. Depois de Lev Landau ter proposto estrelas de neutrões extremamente densas e compactas em 1932, Zwicky e Walter Baade sugeriram que elas poderiam estar no centro das supernovas, o que contribuiu para o desenvolvimento da teoria da evolução estelar.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1911, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willem_Johan_Kolff">Willem Johan Kolff</a>. Este médico holandês-americano e engenheiro biomédico foi pioneiro em órgãos artificiais. Ele inventou a máquina de rim artificial em 1943, antes de emigrar para os EUA (1950). Na primavera de 1955, a Sociedade Americana de Órgãos Internos Artificiais foi formada. Kolff tornou-se seu primeiro presidente. Ele liderou uma equipa que inventou o primeiro coração totalmente artificial, uma bomba pneumática, que foi testada em 12 de dezembro de 1957, implantada no peito do cão. Manteve o cão de 20,7 kg vivo por 90 minutos. Esta foi a primeira vez que um animal viveu com um coração totalmente artificial implantado. Em 2 de dezembro de 1982, sob sua supervisão, o primeiro coração totalmente artificial foi implantado em um paciente humano. Foi projectado por Robert K. Jarvik, um dos alunos de Kolff, que implantou o coração artificial que manteve o paciente, Barney Clark, vivo por 112 dias, comprovando assim a viabilidade de tal procedimento.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1917, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_A._Hauptman">Herbert A. Hauptman</a>. Este matemático e cristalógrafo norte-americano dividiu o Prémio Nobel de Química de 1985 com Jerome Karle, com quem colaborou, “pelas suas notáveis realizações no desenvolvimento de métodos directos para a determinação de estruturas cristalinas”. Eles desenvolveram métodos matemáticos para interpretar os padrões formados no filme fotográfico por raios X difractados através de um composto químico cristalino para determinar sua estrutura molecular. O conhecimento da estrutura tem dois grandes benefícios. Um, na compreensão da função das moléculas em contextos biológicos, especificamente aqueles de “processos receptores de sinais”. Estes incluem processos como actividade enzimática; antígeno - anticorpo; e substância de cheiro - receptor de aroma. Outra é estudar o mecanismo e a dinâmica química das reações.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1954, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Drinfeld">Vladimir Drinfeld</a>. Este matemático soviético cujo trabalho em grupos quânticos e na teoria dos números foi reconhecido com a atribuição de uma Medalha Fields em 1990, quando ele tinha 36 anos, e com o Instituto de Física de Baixa Temperatura e Engenharia em Kharkov, na Rússia. Os seus interesses foram amplos, passando da geometria algébrica e da teoria das formas automórficas para a muito mais nova teoria de grupos quânticos relevantes à física, que ele introduziu em 1985. Este conceito inovador também foi desenvolvido independentemente pelo matemático japonês Michio Jimbo.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que a NASA finalizou a missão do rover Opportunity em Marte. Ao fim de 15 anos de serviço a missão do rover Opportunity, um dos mais bem-sucedidos e duradouros feitos da exploração interplanetária chega ao fim. O rover Opportunity parou de se comunicar com a Terra quando uma tempestade de poeira em Marte cobriu o local onde se encontrava em Junho de 2018. Depois de mais de mil comandos para tentar restaurar o contacto, engenheiros da Unidade de Operações de Voo Espacial do Laboratório de Propulsão a Jato da NASA (JPL) fizeram a sua última tentativa de reviver o Opportunity na passada Terça-feira, sem sucesso. A comunicação final do veículo movido a energia solar foi recebida em 10 de Junho.</p>

<p>Também esta semana ficámos a saber através de um documento desclassificado do US Homeland Security que a partir do próximo dia 6 de Abril de 2019 poderá haver problemas diversos nos sistemas de localização que usam o sistema de GPS. O Problema decorre de um "overflow" que irá ocorrer nesta data. Os sinais GPS dos satélites incluem um timestamp, necessário em parte para calcular a localização, que armazena o número da semana usando dez bits binários. Isto significa que o número da semana pode ter 210 ou 1.024 valores inteiros, contando de zero a 1.023 neste caso. A cada 1.024 semanas, ou aproximadamente a cada 20 anos, o contador passa de 1.023 para zero. Se os dispositivos em uso hoje não tiverem sido projectados ou corrigidos para lidar com esse último rollover, eles serão revertidos para um ano anterior após essa 1.024ª semana em Abril, causando tentativas de calcular a posição falhar. Os dados do sistema e navegação podem até ser corrompidos.</p>

<p>Ainda esta semana, a ARM apresentou a próxima arquitectura de microcontroladores - a Armv8.1-M. A tecnologia Arm Helium é uma nova extensão vetorial M-Profile que traz recursos avançados de computação para a arquitectura Armv8.1-M. Disponibilizando até 15 vezes de desempenho para machine learning e aumento de até 5 vezes para tarefas de processamento de sinal nos dispositivos mais pequenos.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. É apresentada a revista newelectronics de 12 de Fevereiro.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7334">NASA's Opportunity Rover Mission on Mars Comes to End</a></h2>

<p><em>"One of the most successful and enduring feats of interplanetary exploration, NASA's Opportunity rover mission is at an end after almost 15 years exploring the surface of Mars and helping lay the groundwork for NASA's return to the Red Planet. The Opportunity rover stopped communicating with Earth when a severe Mars-wide dust storm blanketed its location in June 2018. After more than a thousand commands to restore contact, engineers in the Space Flight Operations Facility at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) made their last attempt to revive Opportunity Tuesday, to no avail. The solar-powered rover's final communication was received June 10. "It is because of trailblazing missions such as Opportunity that there will come a day when our brave astronauts walk on the surface of Mars," said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. "And when that day arrives, some portion of that first footprint will be owned by the men and women of Opportunity, and a little rover that defied the odds and did so much in the name of exploration.""</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7334">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/02/12/current_gps_epoch_ends/">GPS uses 10 bits to store the week. That means it runs out... oh heck - April 6, 2019</a></h2>

<p><em>"Nav gadgets will be Gah, Properly Screwed if you don't or can't update firmware Older satnavs and such devices won't be able to use America's Global Positioning System properly after April 6 unless they've been suitably updated or designed to handle a looming epoch rollover. GPS signals from satellites include a timestamp, needed in part to calculate one's location, that stores the week number using ten binary bits. That means the week number can have 210 or 1,024 integer values, counting from zero to 1,023 in this case. Every 1,024 weeks, or roughly every 20 years, the counter rolls over from 1,023 to zero. The first Saturday in April will mark the end of the 1,024th week, after which the counter will spill over from 1,023 to zero. The last time the week number overflowed like this was in 1999, nearly two decades on from the first epoch in January 1980."</em> <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/02/12/current_gps_epoch_ends/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.arm.com/company/news/2019/02/next-generation-armv8-1-m-architecture">Next-generation Armv8.1-M architecture: Delivering enhanced machine learning and signal processing for the smallest embedded devices</a></h2>

<p><em>"Arm Helium technology is a new M-Profile Vector Extension bringing enhanced compute capabilities to the Armv8.1-M architecture Delivering up to 15x performance uplift for machine learning and up to 5x uplift to signal processing tasks on the smallest of edge devices For next-generation Cortex-M processors, aimed at small, embedded devices, where local decision-making is required The drive towards a world of a trillion connected devices is accelerating and will continue to do so, but only if we can find ways to efficiently expand the compute capabilities on a greater number of constrained devices at the far edge of the network. Increasing the compute capabilities in these devices will immediately open the door for developers to write machine learning (ML) applications directly for the device for decision-making at the source, thus enhancing data security while cutting down on network energy consumption, latency and bandwidth usage. To achieve this, we’re introducing Arm Helium technology, the M-Profile Vector Extension (MVE) for the Arm Cortex-M series processors that will enhance the compute performance of the Armv8.1-M architecture on the secure foundation of Arm TrustZone. Helium will deliver up to 15x more ML performance and up to 5x uplift to signal processing for future Arm Cortex-M processors, unlocking new market opportunities for our partners where performance challenges have limited the use of low-cost and highly energy-efficient devices. The next level of compute Advanced digital signal processing (DSP) is available today through Arm Neon technology in richer Cortex-A based devices. For more constrained applications, Arm also added DSP extensions in its higher performance Cortex-M processors (Cortex-M4, Cortex-M7, Cortex-M33 and Cortex-M35P)."</em> <a href="https://www.arm.com/company/news/2019/02/next-generation-armv8-1-m-architecture">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Orbex has publicly unveiled its Prime rocket for the first time at the opening of its new headquarters and rocket design facility in Forres in the Scottish Highlands. Designed to deliver small satellites into Earth’s orbit, the rocket was unveiled at an opening ceremony attended by VIPs from the UK and European space community as well as local community stakeholders. The completed engineering prototype of the Stage 2 rocket (the stage that will transit into orbital flight after launch) is made from a specially-formulated lightweight carbon fibre and aluminium composite and includes the world’s largest 3-D printed rocket engine. Orbex Prime is a completely re-thought and re-engineered two-stage rocket, designed by Orbex aerospace engineers with professional experience from organisations including NASA, ESA and Ariane, as well as other commercial spaceflight companies. Thanks to its novel architecture, Prime launchers are up to 30% lighter and 20% more efficient than any other vehicle in the small launcher category, packing more power per cubic litre than many heavy launchers. Seen for the first time, the 3-D printed rocket engine was uniquely manufactured in a single piece without joins in partnership with additive manufacturer SLM Solutions."</em> <a href="https://orbex.space/orbexreveals">[...]</a>

<p><em>"STMicroelectronics, a global semiconductor leader serving customers across the spectrum of electronics applications, has combined its cutting-edge LED-control know-how with advanced power technologies in a new all-in-one LED control chip that enables future luminaires to save more energy and deliver better user experiences. STMicroelectronics Reveals State-Of-The-Art Lighting Controller&amp;nbsp;for Even Greater Energy Savings with Convenience and Simplicity The HVLED001B controller simplifies designing LED-lighting modules, maximizes energy efficiency at all dimming levels, and ensures smoother brightness control. Lighting innovator TCI of Italy, a lead customer, has already designed forthcoming products containing the new chip to increase energy savings, safety, and usability. Explaining that to create mid- and high-power LED luminaires to satisfy the latest lighting regulations and market demands is no easy challenge, a technical spokesperson for TCI said, “ST’s new LED driver enabled us to achieve our high performance targets, leveraging built-in features that simplify design and reduce the bill of materials. LED power-up is extremely fast, taking less than 0.4 seconds, and efficiency remains very high even at the lower dimming levels where conventional drivers can lose their edge.” Matteo Lo Presti, Executive Vice President, Analog Sub-Group General Manager in ST’s Analog, MEMS and Sensors Group, added, “As well as further improving energy efficiency under all operating conditions, the latest luminaires must support smart-grid management and power quality by increasing power factor and reducing harmonic distortion. The HVLED001B makes these targets achievable, at the same time as supporting improved start-up performance and dimming accuracy.” The HVLED001B is in production now, housed in the familiar and compact SSOP10 package, and available from $0.687 for orders of 1000 pieces."</em> <a href="https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/about/media-center/press-item.html/p4133.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A newly launched installer tool can let you experience Windows 10 on the Raspberry Pi 3. The new application comes from the same maker who brought the Windows 10 on ARM onto Lumia 950 and 950 XL handset. The developer named Jose Manuel Nieto Sanchez says the tool is “super easy to use” with “no-hassle.” There is also a dedicated Github page where you can find the WoA installer, to create a bootable Windows 10 on ARM image for Raspberry Pi. For setup, you just need a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B or B+, a microSD card (an A1 rating is recommended) and a Windows 10ARM64 image, the latest core package, and these instructions. With a set of binaries, and the Core Package, the tool could be run easily, but Sanchez points out that these binaries do not belong to him. They are bundled and “offered just for convenience to make your life easier, since this tool is focused on simplicity.” Earlier, the only way to run Windows was only by using the Windows IoT Core, but Windows 10 on ARM is far more capable but don’t expect a super speedy booting or snappy experience."</em> <a href="https://fossbytes.com/you-can-run-windows-10-arm-on-raspberry-pi-3-with-this-woa-installer/">[...]</a>

Google declined to comment on the hires. Jim McGregor, who follows the semiconductor industry for Tirias Research, said since most traditional chipmakers long have had large presences in Bengaluru, it made sense for the industry’s new players to start following to find experts. “Everyone tries to keep things close to home when starting out, but when you reach a certain level of success you have to expand out,” McGregor said. Since 2014, Google has designed computer server chips for its data centers and an image processing chip for its Pixel smartphones."</em> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-google-chips/google-extends-chip-making-efforts-to-design-hub-bengaluru-idUSKCN1Q01B8">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Ordnance Survey and a team of world-leading aeronautic engineers are developing a highly innovative solar powered, High Altitude Pseudo Satellite (HAPS) that is going to change the face of Earth observation and the way we map our planet. The pioneering enterprise, called Astigan, will give quicker and better images of the Earth through a platform which will fly at 67,000 ft, nearly twice the cruising height of a commercial airliner. The platform, which weighs 149kg and has a wingspan of 38m, can be positioned to view any part of the Earth and collect data over much wider areas compared to conventional aerial imagery capture. The platform has been designed to complement existing satellite services and it will fly for 90 days at a time without the need for landing, the equivalent of circling the Earth four-and-a-half times. Business Minister Lord Henley said: “The UK has a particularly successful track record in mapping and associated technology. This exciting new unmanned aircraft project is a brilliant example of the innovative thinking behind our modern Industrial Strategy and should lead to global business opportunities."</em> <a href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/about/news/2019/astigan-high-altitude-pseudo-satellite.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Research from the lab of assistant professor of chemistry Gabriela Schlau-Cohen advances the understanding of plants' photosynthetic machinery. Green plants capture light that spans the visible solar spectrum, and while a broad spectral range is required for sufficient absorption, the process requires energy to be funneled rapidly and efficiently downhill to drive charge separation and water splitting. Carotenoids, the accessory pigments in photosynthesis, play light harvesting, photoprotective, and structural roles. Understanding these roles, however, has proved to be a challenge due to the fact that carotenoid's energetics are highly sensitive to their environment. Now a team led by Thomas D. and Virginia W. Cabot Career Development Assistant Professor Gabriela Schlau-Cohen has discovered that a single carotenoid — LHCII — in the major antenna complex of green plants serves as the nexus of light harvesting by accum ulating energy and transferring it through a debated dark state. These photophysics reveal how plants expand their capacity to capture and utilize solar energy."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/mit-research-reveals-how-plants-expand-capacity-to-use-solar-energy-0206">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Approach suppresses spectral cross-talk in dual-band photodetectors A new method developed by Northwestern Engineering’s Manijeh Razeghi has greatly reduced a type of image distortion caused by the presence of spectral cross-talk between dual-band long-wavelength photodetectors. The work opens the door for a new generation of high spectral-contrast infrared imaging devices with applications in medicine, defense and security, planetary sciences, and art preservation. “Dual-band photodetectors offer many benefits in infrared imaging, including higher quality images and more available data for image processing algorithms,” said Razeghi, Walter P. Murphy Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering in the McCormick School of Engineering. “However, performance can be limited by spectral cross-talk interference between the two channels, which leads to poor spectral contrast and prevents infrared camera technology from reaching its true potential.” A paper outlining her work, titled “Suppressing Spectral Crosstalk in Dual-Band Long- Wavelength Infrared Photodetectors with Monolithically Integrated Air-Gapped Distributed Bragg Reflectors,” was recently published in the IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics. Dual-band imaging allows for objects to be seen in multiple wavelength channels through a single infrared camera. The use of dual-band detection in night-vision cameras, for example, can help the wearer better distinguish between moving targets and objects in the background."</em> <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/news/articles/2019/02/new-method-improves-infrared-imaging-performance.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Experimental study done at UC Riverside and University of Washington on monolayer tungsten ditelluride could lead to more energy-efficient electronic devices A research team comprised of scientists at the University of California, Riverside, and the University of Washington has for the first time directly imaged “edge conduction” in monolayer tungsten ditelluride, or WTe2, a newly discovered 2-D topological insulator and quantum material. The research makes it possible to exploit this edge conduction feature to build more energy-efficient electronic devices. In a typical conductor, electrical current flows everywhere. Insulators, on the other hand, do not readily conduct electricity. In topological insulators, a special type of material, the interior works as an insulator, but the boundaries of such materials are guaranteed to be conductive due to its topological property, resulting in a feature called “topological edge conduction.” Topology is the mathematical study of the properties of a geometric figure or solid that is unchanged by stretching or bending. Applying this concept to electronic materials leads to discoveries of many interesting phenomena, including topological edge conduction."</em> <a href="https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2019/02/08/scientists-image-conducting-edges-promising-2-d-material">[...]</a>

Whether it is designing the most effective method for fuel injection in engines, building machinery to water acres of farmland, or painting a car, humans rely on liquid sprays for countless industrial processes that enable and enrich our daily lives. To understand how to make liquid jet spray cleaner and more efficient, though, researchers have to focus on the little things: Scientists must observe fluids flowing in atomic, microsecond detail in order to begin to understand one of science’s great challenges—turbulent motion in fluids. Experiments serve as an important tool for understanding industrial spray processes, but researchers have increasingly come to rely on simulation for understanding and modelling the laws governing the chaotic, turbulent motions present when fluids are flowing quickly. A team of researchers led by Prof. Dr. Markus Klein at the Bundeswehr University Munich (German: Universität der Bundeswehr München) understood that modelling the complexities of turbulence accurately and efficiently requires it to employ high-performance computing (HPC), and recently, it has been using Gauss Centre for Supercomputing (GCS) resources at the Leibniz Supercomputing Centre (LRZ) in Garching near Munich to create high-end flow simulations for better understanding turbulent fluid motion. “Our goal is to develop simulation software that someone can apply commercially for real engineering problems,” says Dr. Josef Haßlberger, collaborator on the Klein team."</em> <a href="http://www.gauss-centre.eu/SharedDocs/Meldungen/GAUSS-CENTRE/EN/2019/news_03_Uni_Bundeswehr_Jet_Spray.html">[...]</a>

The problem is that there is a limit to how small the main components that make these functions possible; transistors, can shrink to fit on-chip and still provide higher performance and energy efficiency. Instead of cramming more transistors onto a single chip, companies have been exploring stacking or arranging multiple chips close to each other into a single assembled unit to boost performance and keep manufacturing costs low – a technique called heterogeneous integration. Through a new center funded by the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC), Purdue University and Binghamton University will improve how to "package," or protect and supply power to, chips of various functions integrated together. The Center for Heterogeneous Integration Research in Packaging, or CHIRP, will be co-directed by Ganesh Subbarayan, professor of mechanical engineering at Purdue, and Bahgat Sammakia, vice president for research and a distinguished professor of mechanical engineering at Binghamton.

However, LSBs face the obstacle of having a capacity reaching its theoretical maximum because they are prone to uncontrolled growth of lithium sulfide on the electrodes, which leads to blocking electron transfer.

So, I decided to use them for something useful. Most obvious idea was to develop own 8-bit retro computer."</em> <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/163671-6502-retro-controller-board">[...]</a>

This is because the hydrogen and oxygen atoms don’t have free electrons. In a typical domestic water supply, it’s the impurities such as sodium, calcium, and magnesium salts that enable electrons to flow. This interesting fact means that you can assess the purity of water by measuring its electrical resistance."</em> <a href="https://makezine.com/projects/build-a-water-quality-tester-you-can-hear/">[...]</a>

Anyway, in this instructable, part of a series I'm starting here AND on youtube is about how to start it. Please make sure to watch my youtube video as well where I explain everything as one segment and you can code along side me."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Start-Developing-STM32-on-Linux/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Components: - ATtiny1614 microcontroller - SOP14 adapter board - 128x64 OLED screen with SSD1306 driver - JS5208 5 way switch - WS2812B LED - 2mm PMMA optic fiber - micro usb breakout (I used part of a custom PCB from an earlier project, you could use this one for example. Unfortunately all the breakouts I can find use connectors without through hole pins, so they tear out easily.) - power switch (this one looks similar to mine) - Threaded inserts for the LCD case back (These are pretty unnecesary, you can just screw directly into the plastic if you make the hole smaller, or glue the case together. I have a lot of them so I use them for everything. They push into the plastic with a soldering iron set to low heat (~100 °C).) The hole in the side cover (opposite the window) is used to reprogram the MCU without dissasembling the tinypc."</em> <a href="https://github.com/PaulKlinger/tinypc">[...]</a>

See the video below to see how the project was built. You can follow the tutorial and build it yourself, but I recommend that you check out this tutorial afterwards, so you can look back at it and see how it was done! Step 1: Building the frame The frame is basically built by eye, and can be sawed out by a jigsaw in some plywood, or you can use a cnc cutter like we did. the measurements aren't that important, as long as they match what you want to have in your final product."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/by-zylauv/diy-arduino-cocktail-machine-0eee04">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The aim of this project is to design, build, and test a low-cost measurement system for Building Performance Evaluation studies that includes at least temperature, relative humidity, illuminance, and is extensible to additional sensors, and to develop the prototype of these devices. This results in a customized and affordable system that enable stakeholders conduct the measurements required for building performance evaluation in an efficient and affordable manner by logging multiple environmental parameters at once. The Open Source Data Logger (OPENSDL) developed was compared against a HOBO U12-012 data logger. This commercially available counterpart system, can measure 3 parameters, namely- temperature, RH, and illuminance, and one external channel for other sensor types. A different sensing device would be required for measurement of any other parameter. The characteristics of parameters to be measured are limited to the proprietary hardware and software, which restricts the system to measuring of certain parameters with specific accuracies."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Open-Source-Data-Logger-OPENSDL/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Just a side project for fun (actually trying out other combinations with the spy mirror, in this case a combination of diffuse acrylic as kind of light guidance). Nothing new by itself, just a remix/thrown together of well-known technologies 2 circles of spy mirror acrlic hold sheets of normal acrylic in between, where the middle layer holds spaces for diffuse acrylic rods as clock pointer. A strip of WS2812b Leds is then wrapped around, everything covered with 3D-printed parts. In the socket a 3*AA battery holder is used for power supply, control is done with an Arduino Nano (clone) and a PCF8523 real time clock module. Minutes and Hours should be at the moment distiguished by brightness (not really the best way), while both change color over time. Easier and better to distinguish would be of course two different (constant) colors for hours and minutes, but where is the art in useful displays ^^."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/MirrorClock/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The esp-link firmware connects a micro-controller to the internet using an ESP8266 Wifi module. It implements a number of features: - transparent bridge between Wifi and serial, useful for debugging or inputting into a uC - flash-programming attached Arduino/AVR microcontrollers and LPC800-series and other ARM microcontrollers via Wifi - built-in stk500v1 programmer for AVR uC's: program using HTTP upload of hex file - outbound REST HTTP requests from the attached micro-controller to the internet - MQTT client pub/sub from the attached micro-controller to the internet - serve custom web pages containing data that is dynamically pulled from the attached uC and that contain buttons and fields that are transmitted to the attached uC (feature not fully ready yet) The firmware includes a tiny HTTP server based on esphttpd with a simple web interface, many thanks to Jeroen Domburg for making it available! The REST and MQTT functionality are loosely based on espduino but significantly rewritten and no longer protocol compatible, thanks to tuanpmt for the inspiration! The following people contributed significant functionality to esp-link: brunnels (espduino integration), cskarai (custom dynamic web pages), beegee-tokyo (lots of code documentation), susisstrolch (syslog feature), bc547 and katast (misc contributions). Esp-link is the work of many contributors! Note that http://github.com/jeelabs/esp-link is the original esp-link software which has notably been forked by arduino.org as Esp-Link and shipped with the initial Arduino Uno Wifi."</em> <a href="https://github.com/jeelabs/esp-link">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Sunlight is essential for our survival, but too much of a good thing can sometimes be harmful. That certainly applies to the invisible ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths of sunlight, for too much exposure to UV can cause sunburn and even skin cancer. Yet, moderate exposure is important, for both mammals and reptiles depend on ultraviolet sunlight to manufacture the vitamin D that supports the growth of bones and fights some diseases. ULTRAVIOLET AND HEALTH Light is specified according to its wavelength. For example, green light near the peak response of human vision has a wavelength of 500 nanometers (nm) or half a micrometer. If UV wavelengths were visible, they would appear adjacent to the violet portion of a rainbow."</em> <a href="https://makezine.com/projects/build-hack-and-deploy-detectors-to-measure-solar-uv-radiation/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Reusing some left over spy mirror acrylics (because we didn't want to throw away stuff) and experimenting with UV light. While the big led cubes can be scaled up easily, for smaller cubes using LED stripes become to complicated and take to much space. Therefore we needed another light source for the columns. Thats why i exchanged the active stripes with the passive fluorescent material, enlightened by a single LED. As a result, infinity earrings were born (just by chance happening at valentines day :). Since they are easy to make, can reuse left over material and use few different construction techniques as well as electronics, they might be a also a nice idea for children workshops (or even easier/faster: just one micro cube on a small podest similar like the big one in an instructable before) For each mini cube we need a little bit of spy mirror (lasercut into 6 27*27 square millimiter pieces), a 3D printed frame for both mirrors and batteries (2 2032 3V coin cells), a 5mm UV diode and fluorescent paint."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Infinity-Earrings/">[...]</a>
