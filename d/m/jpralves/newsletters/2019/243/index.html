<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1791, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage">Charles Babbage</a>. Este matemático inglês foi pioneiro da computação mecânica, para tentar eliminar imprecisões nas tabelas matemáticas. Em 1822, ele tinha uma pequena máquina de calcular capaz de calcular quadrados. Ele produziu protótipos de partes de um mecanismo de diferença maior. (Georg e Edvard Schuetz posteriormente construíram os primeiros dispositivos de trabalho com o mesmo desenho, que foram bem-sucedidos em aplicações limitadas.) Em 1833, ele iniciou a sua máquina analítica programável, precursora dos computadores modernos. As suas outras invenções incluem o cowcatcher (uma armação de metal na frente de uma locomotiva para afastar o gado ou outros obstáculos na linha), dinamómetro, medidor padrão de ferrovia, tarifas postais uniformes, luzes ocultas para faróis, sinais de hora de Greenwich, oftalmoscópio heliográfico. Ele também tinha interesse em cifras e fechaduras.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1838, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clemens_Winkler">Clemens Winkler</a>. Este químico alemão descobriu o elemento químico germânio (1886). No início da sua carreira, ele desenvolveu novas técnicas para análise de gás industrial e desenvolveu a bureta de gás Winkler. Quando, na Academia de Mineração Freiberg, a Escola Freiberg de Mineração analisou o mineral argirodita (um minério de sulfeto de prata), ele descobriu que todos os elementos conhecidos continham apenas 93% do seu peso. Depois de passar quatro meses a investigar e isolar os 7% restantes, ele encontrou o novo elemento a que chamou germânio, em nome da Alemanha. Este foi o terceiro dos elementos (eka-silício) previsto por Dmitry I. Mendeleyev em 1871.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1928, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Cooper_(inventor)">Martin Cooper</a>. Este engenheiro americano é pioneiro no sector de comunicações sem fio, especialmente na gestão de espectro de rádio, com onze patentes nessa área. Enquanto estava na Motorola na década de 1970, Cooper inventou o primeiro telemóvel (diferente do telefone do carro) em 1973 e liderou a equipa que o desenvolveu e o colocou no mercado em 1983. Ele é considerado o "pai do telemóvel" e também é citado como a primeira pessoa na história a fazer um telefonema através de um telemóvel em público.</p>

<p>E nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que a ultima missão espacial do ano vai ser lançada no dia 27 de Dezembro. Lançada pela Russia, no foguetão Rockot, transportará o 15º grupo de três satélites de comunicações de baixa órbita Gonets-M. Também se espera que o mesmo lançamento entregue um par de esferas de vidro polido, chamadas Blits-M que são usadas como reflectores a laser em estudos gravitacionais de alta precisão.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker.</p>

<p>Esta é a última newsletter de 2019, nesse sentido resta-me desejar a todos os excelente 2020 cheio de projectos e de alegrias!</p>

They received official production numbers No. 24, 25 and 26. The same launch was also expected to deliver a pair of polished glass spheres called Blits-M which are used as laser reflectors in high-accuracy gravitational studies, even though only one actually made it onboard the rocket. The Blits series was developed at SPP, a Roskosmos enterprise specialized in guidance and tracking systems for the military and space industry.

<p><em>"With natural language processing widely being adopted across a growing number of use cases from search engines to mobile smart assistants, leading pre-training language models like Baidu’s ERNIE (Enhanced Representation through kNowledge IntEgration) are receiving strong attention within the machine learning community due to their advancements. After substantial progress since its release earlier this year, today we are excited to announce that ERNIE has achieved new state-of-the-art performance on GLUE and become the world’s first model to score over 90 in terms of the macro-average score (90.1). GLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation) is a widely-recognized multi-task benchmark and analysis platform for natural language understanding (NLU). It comprises multiple NLU tasks including question answering, sentiment analysis, textual entailment, and an associated online platform for model evaluation, comparison, and analysis. ERNIE is a continual pre-training framework that builds and learns incrementally by pre-training tasks through sequential multi-task learning. We introduced ERNIE 1.0 early this year and released the improved ERNIE 2.0 model in July."</em> <a href="http://research.baidu.com/Blog/index-view?id=128">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Study: After eBay improved its translation software, international commerce increased sharply. A new study co-authored by an MIT economist shows that improved translation software can significantly boost international trade online — a notable case of machine learning having a clear impact on economic activity. The research finds that after eBay improved its automatic translation program in 2014, commerce shot up by 10.9 percent among pairs of countries where people could use the new system. “That’s a striking number. To have it be so clear in such a short amount of time really says a lot about the power of this technology,” says Erik Brynjolfsson, an MIT economist and co-author of a new paper detailing the results. To put the results in perspective, he adds, consider that physical distance is, by itself, also a significant barrier to global commerce."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/machine-learning-sales-ebay-translation-1220">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Technique may help remotely image and assess health of infants, burn victims, and accident survivors in hard-to-reach places. For most people, getting an ultrasound is a relatively easy procedure: As a technician gently presses a probe against a patient’s skin, sound waves generated by the probe travel through the skin, bouncing off muscle, fat, and other soft tissues before reflecting back to the probe, which detects and translates the waves into an image of what lies beneath. Conventional ultrasound doesn’t expose patients to harmful radiation as X-ray and CT scanners do, and it’s generally noninvasive. But it does require contact with a patient’s body, and as such, may be limiting in situations where clinicians might want to image patients who don’t tolerate the probe well, such as babies, burn victims, or other patients with sensitive skin. Furthermore, ultrasound probe contact induces significant image variability, which is a major challenge in modern ultrasound imaging. Now, MIT engineers have come up with an alternative to conventional ultrasound that doesn’t require contact with the body to see inside a patient."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/first-laser-ultrasound-images-humans-1219">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/capturing-co2-from-trucks-and-reducing-their-emiss/">Capturing CO2 from trucks and reducing their emissions by 90%</a></h2>

<p><em>"Researchers at EPFL have patented a new concept that could cut trucks’ CO2 emissions by almost 90%. It involves capturing CO2 within the exhaust system, converting it into a liquid and storing it on the vehicle. The liquid CO2 would then be delivered to a service station and where it will be turned back into fuel using renewable energy. In Europe, transport is responsible for nearly 30% of the total CO2 emissions, of which 72% comes from road transportation*. While the use of electric vehicles for personal transportation could help lower that number, reducing emissions from commercial transport – such as trucks or buses – is a much greater challenge. Researchers at EPFL have now come up with a novel solution: capturing CO2 directly in the trucks’ exhaust system and liquefying it in a box on the vehicle’s roof."</em> <a href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/capturing-co2-from-trucks-and-reducing-their-emiss/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A molecule that’s known for its smelly and poisonous nature on Earth may be a sure-fire sign of extraterrestrial life. Phosphine is among the stinkiest, most toxic gases on Earth, found in some of the foulest of places, including penguin dung heaps, the depths of swamps and bogs, and even in the bowels of some badgers and fish. This putrid “swamp gas” is also highly flammable and reactive with particles in our atmosphere. Most life on Earth, specifically all aerobic, oxygen-breathing life, wants nothing to do with phosphine, neither producing it nor relying on it for survival. Now MIT researchers have found that phosphine is produced by another, less abundant life form: anaerobic organisms, such as bacteria and microbes, that don’t require oxygen to thrive. The team found that phosphine cannot be produced in any other way except by these extreme, oxygen-averse organisms, making phosphine a pure biosignature — a sign of life (at least of a certain kind)."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/phosphine-aliens-stink-1218">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Physical computing is a complex activity that consists of different but tightly coupled tasks: programming and assembling hardware for circuits. Prior work clearly shows that this coupling is the main source of mistakes that unfruitfully take a large portion of novices’ debugging time. While past work presented systems that simplify prototyping or introduce novel debugging functionalities, these tools either limit what users can accomplish or are too complex for beginners. In this paper, we propose a general-purpose prototyping tool based on conversation. HeyTeddy guides users during hardware assembly by providing additional information on requests or by interactively presenting the assembly steps to build a circuit. Furthermore, the user can program and execute code in real-time on their Arduino platform without having to write any code, but instead by using commands triggered by voice or text via chat."</em> <a href="http://makinteract.kaist.ac.kr/project/heyteddy-2019">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/805235">New polymer material may help batteries become self-healing, recyclable</a></h2>

<p><em>"Lithium-ion batteries are notorious for developing internal electrical shorts that can ignite a battery’s liquid electrolytes, leading to explosions and fires. Engineers at the University of Illinois have developed a solid polymer-based electrolyte that can self-heal after damage – and the material can also be recycled without the use of harsh chemicals or high temperatures. The new study, which could help manufacturers produce recyclable, self-healing commercial batteries, is published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. As lithium-ion batteries go through multiple cycles of charge and discharge, they develop tiny, branchlike structures of solid lithium called dendrites, the researchers said. These structures reduce battery life, cause hotspots and electrical shorts, and sometimes grow large enough to puncture the internal parts of the battery, causing explosive chemical reactions between the electrodes and electrolyte liquids. There has been a push by chemists and engineers to replace the liquid electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries with solid materials such as ceramics or polymers, the researchers said."</em> <a href="https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/805235">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A new uncrackable security system created by researchers at the University of St Andrews, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) and the Center for Unconventional Processes of Sciences (CUP Sciences) is set to revolutionise communications privacy. The international team of scientists have created optical chips that enable information to be sent from user to user using a one-time unhackable communication that achieves ‘perfect secrecy’, allowing confidential data to be protected more securely than ever before on public classical communication channels. The proposed system uses silicon chips that contain complex structures that are irreversibly changed to send information in a one-time key that can never be recreated nor intercepted by an attacker. The technology overcomes the major threat of quantum computers, which are soon predicted to be able to crack existing communication methods, uses existing communication networks and takes up less space on networks. The results, published in the scientific journal Nature Communications, open a new pathway towards implementing ‘perfect secrecy’ cryptography at the global scale with contained costs. First author, Professor Andrea di Falco of the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of St Andrews, said: “This new technique is absolutely unbreakable, as we rigorously demonstrated in our article."</em> <a href="https://news.st-andrews.ac.uk/archive/new-security-system-to-revolutionise-privacy/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Handling very soft, delicate items without damaging them is hard enough with human hands, let alone doing it at the microscopic scale with laboratory instruments. Three new studies show how scientists have honed a technique for handling tiny, soft particles using precisely controlled fluid flows that act as gentle microscopic hands. The technique allows researchers to test the physical limits of these soft particles and the things made from them – ranging from biological tissues to fabric softeners. The three studies, led by the University of Illinois’ Charles Schroeder, the Ray and Beverly Mentzer Faculty Scholar of chemical and biomolecular engineering, detail the technology and application of the Stokes trap – a method for manipulating small particles using only fluid flow. In the newest study, published in the journal Soft Matter, the team used the Stokes trap to study the dynamics of vesicles – squishy fluid-filled particles that are stripped-down versions of cells and have direct relevance to biological systems, the researchers said. This follows up on two recent studies in the journals Physical Review Fluids and Physical Review Applied that expanded the power of the trapping method."</em> <a href="https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/805238">[...]</a>

The ability to transmit messages across relatively long distances on a silicon chip using multiple qubits could open new possibilities for quantum computing. The Princeton team, led by professor Jason Petta, connected the qubits via a narrow cavity that carried light in a way similar to the fiber optic cables that deliver internet signals to homes and businesses. The cavity contained a single photon, which could receive a message from one qubit and transmit it to the next qubit. The two qubits were located about one-half centimeter apart.

In addition, Node.js has a built-in HTTP module that allows Node.js to transfer data over the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol(HTTP) and it can create an HTTP server that listens to server ports. The SerialPort object of Node.js is also quite useful to open a port and it allows reading or writing to the serial port at any time.

At that time it was one of the cheapest on the market. It has never really gone away and now it is used by hobbyists and professionals for many applications. The version I am using is the W65C02S6TPG-14 which is made by Western Design Centre and uses ten times less power than the original. It is special in that it does not have to run at 1 MHz like the original chip."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/6502-Minimal-Computer-with-Arduino-MEGA/">[...]</a>

The new MINI FLIGHT RECORDER (MFR from now on) has the following functionality: – Barometric/Altimeter sensor MPL3115A2 – Built in temperature sensor – 3D High g accelerometer ADXL375 – 128×32 OLED graphic display – 2MB built-in memory – 820 seconds recording time from all sensors – 40 SPS (25 msec between data points) – Built-in LIPO battery – Battery level indication – Built-in USB LIPO charger – USB port – Size 38x12x12mm (including battery) – Weight 5.6gr (including battery) – USB bootloader – Firmware update through the USB"</em> <a href="http://www.blog.exrockets.com/blog/mini-flight-recorder/">[...]</a>

Send LED pixel strip state as a table (number of pixels * 3 RGB channels) over the internet available WebSocket. Thanks to that you can integrate LED pixel strips with other systems in very easy way. Sample application could be: make light FFT efect to a music played on your laptop smart TV backlight connecting ledstrip with a movement sensor in your lobby make a cool light decoration for your christmas tree that interacts with environment (eg. if someones enters room)"</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/donowak/internet-api-for-led-pixel-strip-based-on-esp32-faec91">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Take Nvidia's JetBot platform to the next level by expanding the functionality of the Jetbot API by adding new sensors and drivers. Nvidia’s JetBot Platform After training your Jetson Nano to recognize how many fingers you’re holding up or whether you’re giving a thumb’s up or thumb’s down gesture, you might be wondering about the next possible project. Nvidia has developed a robotics platform that utilizes the Jetson Nano called the JetBot. It lets users control two motors via I2C and a PCA9685, along with viewing output on an OLED or via the web, and finally, it has support for a camera in order to perform computer vision tasks. On its own, the JetBot is a nice development platform to have fun with and experiment, but it lacks support for many important sensors and has limited capabilities for motor control. Possible Customizations Since I was planning on creating several robotics projects that rely on sensors besides a sole camera, I needed a way to interface them with the JetBot API and GPIO."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/gatoninja236/building-a-custom-jetbot-with-jetson-nano-8d41b6">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Thanks to the MT8870 chip, connecting the outputs of STQ, Q4, Q3, Q2 and Q1 to a transistor allowing to open or close the buttons of a GAMEPAD, DTMF tones can be decoded. We only ineed 5 pins (control buttons). It has been created as proof of concept a simple program in VB6 (to work in old equipment W95) to be able to read the buttons and translate it to DTMF tones. The program is not optimized, so send the tones slowly. You can use the web generator http://mamclain.com/?page=RND_SOFTWARE_DTMF_WEB_APP Can be tested with Windows' own joystick tester The concept is very simple, being the most difficult part in the manualities, to leave the control well prepared. The MT8870 can be powered with the 5 volts of usb, which we can take out following the cables of the control with a mulitester."</em> <a href="https://github.com/rpsubc8/gamepadDTMF/blob/master/readmeEnglish.md">[...]</a>

<p><em>"As always, friends ask me to support them for the technlogical part in their events, parties and so on. So this Christmas I’m involved in various Christmas pageants: I’ll be responsible to manage the audio part of the event (I don’t like to use the word ‘deejay’). I come from Commodore64 and Arcade coin-ops so I developed an idiosyncrasy for the mouse and I prefer a lot using keys and keyboard shortcuts when is possible… but my laptop is very old and it doesn’t have multimedia buttons. So I thinked to build me an USB multimedia-only-keys keyboard. I had a spare Olimexino 32U4 (an Arduino Leonardo clone) and some Arcade-Style microswitch pushbuttons: knowing the fact that the Leonardo has a lot of pre-cooked example about keyboard and mouse emulation I don’t think it twice about using those components. There was some initial difficulties: the Arduino examples don’t cover the multimedia buttons."</em> <a href="https://www.settorezero.com/wordpress/en/una-tastiera-usb-con-controlli-per-i-media-players-con-arduino-leonardo/">[...]</a>
