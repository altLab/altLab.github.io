<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1797, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Pineo_Gesner">Abraham Pineo Gesner</a>. Este Químico e geólogo canadiano foi pioneiro na extracção de querosene (que ele nomeou) pela destilação seca de rocha asfáltica. Ele percebeu a utilidade desse líquido (conhecido como parafina na Inglaterra) como combustível mais limpo em lâmpadas para substituir o óleo de baleia. Ele também inventou um preservante de madeira, um processo de pavimentação de estradas de asfalto, briquetes de pó de carvão compactados e uma máquina para isolar fios eléctricos.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1802, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Gustav_Magnus">Heinrich Gustav Magnus</a>. Este químico e físico alemão descobriu o efeito Magnus (a força de sustentação produzida por um cilindro rotativo, que por exemplo, dá a curva a uma bola curva). Na pesquisa química, ele descobriu o primeiro dos compostos de platina-amónio. O sal verde de Magnus é [Pt(NH3)4][PtCl4]). Com interesses diversos na ciência, ele também trabalhou na absorção de gases pelo sangue, na expansão de gases quando aquecidos, nas pressões de vapor de água e em várias soluções, electrólise, correntes induzidas e termoeléctricas, óptica, magnetismo e hidrodinâmica. Em 1865, ele representou a Prússia numa conferência convocada para introduzir um sistema métrico uniforme de pesos e medidas na Alemanha.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1844, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah_McCoy">Elijah McCoy</a>.
Este inventor e engenheiro afro-americano destacou-se pelas suas 57 patentes americanas, a maioria das quais tem a ver com a lubrificação de motores a vapor.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1868, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_W._Wood">Robert W. Wood</a>. Este Físico americano fotografou o reflexo das ondas sonoras no ar e investigou os efeitos fisiológicos das ondas sonoras de alta frequência. A placa de zona que ele criou poderia substituir a lente objectiva de um telescópio. Ele inventou uma grade de difracção melhorada, fez pesquisas em espectroscopia e ampliou a técnica de espectroscopia Raman (um método para estudar matéria usando a luz espalhada por ela). Ele fez fotografias a mostrar a radiação infravermelha e ultravioleta e foi o primeiro a fotografar fluorescência ultravioleta. Wood foi o primeiro a observar o fenómeno de emissão de campo no qual partículas carregadas são emitidas de condutores num campo eléctrico.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1947, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Dyson">James Dyson</a>. Este Engenheiro e inventor inglês é conhecido pelas suas invenções que incluem o aspirador sem saco Dual Cyclone e o secador de mãos Airblade. Ele fundou a Dyson Research Ltd. em 1979. Desde 1970, quando reinventou o carrinho de mão como seu Ballbarrow, ele procurou criar novos produtos que funcionassem melhor do que qualquer coisa antes deles. Ele lançou um aspirador de pó sem saco fabricado e vendido no Japão em 1986. Quando foi introduzido na Grã-Bretanha em 1993, o seu aspirador de pó tornou-se o mais vendido no início de 1995. Da mesma forma, quando vendido nos EUA a partir de 2002, capturou 20% do mercado.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou uma equipa de cientistas anunciou que estão a preparar-se para a passagem de um asteróide dentro de uma década. A aproximação do Apophis em 2029 será uma oportunidade incrível para a ciência dizem os cientistas. É raro um asteróide deste tamanho passar tão perto da Terra. Embora os cientistas tenham visto pequenos asteróides, na ordem de 5 a 10 metros, passando pela Terra a uma distância similar, os asteróides do tamanho de Apophis são muito menos numerosos e, portanto, não passam tão perto da Terra quanto costumam. O asteróide Apophis tem um diâmetro de 370 metros e foi descoberto em 2004.</p>

<p>Também esta semana foi lançada a nova versão do sistema Fedora. A versão 30 conta como principais novidades o Gnome 3.32, o GCC 9, o Bash 5.0 e a glibc to 2.29.</p>

<p>Ainda esta semana ficámos a saber que programadores resolvem enigma criptográfico com 20 anos do MIT. Bernard Fabrot passou os últimos três anos e meio a tentar encontrar a solução para um quebra-cabeça anunciado pela primeira vez pelos pesquisadores do MIT em 1999. Separadamente, outra equipa liderada pelo executivo de tecnologia Simon Peffers está prestes a concluir uma solução. O quebra-cabeça envolve essencialmente fazer cerca de 80 triliões de quadraturas sucessivas sobre um número inicial, e foi especificamente projectado para evitar que alguém tente resolvê-lo mais rapidamente usando a computação paralela. Fabrot e Peffers adoptaram abordagens muito diferentes para o desafio. Fabrot usou um Intel Core i7-6700 simples, encontrado em PCs de consumo, e calculou a solução usando a Biblioteca Aritmética de Precisão Múltipla GNU (GMP). Por outro lado, a equipa de Peffers usou um novo algoritmo de multiplicação (projectado por Erdinç Öztürk da Universidade de Sabanci) para ser executado num acelerador de hardware programável chamado FPGA. A equipa, que está a trabalhar como parte de uma colaboração chamada Cryptophage, está no caminho certo para terminar o quebra-cabeça a 11 de maio, após apenas dois meses de computação. No anúncio original, a LCS prometeu que, se uma solução correta fosse apresentada, eles abririam uma “cápsula do tempo” especial projectada pelo arquitecto Frank Gehry e repleta de artefactos históricos do inventor da Web Tim Berners-Lee, do co-inventor da Ethernet, Bob Metcalfe e do fundador da Microsoft, Bill Gates. A cerimonia da abertura da cápsula acontecerá na quarta-feira, 15 de maio, às 16h. no Stata Center do MIT.</p>

<p><em>"Jets of fast-moving material shot from the area surrounding a black hole are wobbling so fast that their change in direction can be seen in periods as short as minutes, and astronomers say it’s happening because the rotating black hole’s powerful gravitational pull is dragging nearby space itself along with it. “We’ve never seen this effect happening on such short timescales,” said James Miller-Jones, of the Curtin University node of the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR), who led a team using the National Science Foundation’s Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). The team studied V404 Cygni, a black hole nine times more massive than the Sun, nearly 8,000 light-years from Earth. The black hole is drawing in material from a companion star with a mass about 70 percent that of the Sun. As the material streams toward the black hole, it forms a rotating disk, called an accretion disk, surrounding the black hole. In such systems, the disk becomes denser and hotter with decreasing distance from the black hole."</em> <a href="https://public.nrao.edu/news/black-hole-jets-rapid-wobble/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"On April 13, 2029, a speck of light will streak across the sky, getting brighter and faster. At one point it will travel more than the width of the full Moon within a minute and it will get as bright as the stars in the Little Dipper. But it won't be a satellite or an airplane - it will be a 1,100-foot-wide (340-meter-wide) near-Earth asteroid called 99942 Apophis that will cruise harmlessly by Earth, about 19,000 miles (31,000 kilometers) above the surface. That's within the distance that some of our spacecraft that orbit Earth. The international asteroid research community couldn't be more excited. This week at the 2019 Planetary Defense Conference in College Park, Maryland, scientists are gathering to discuss observation plans and science opportunities for the celestial event still a decade away."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7390">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This week MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) announced that a 20-year-old cryptographic puzzle was just solved by a self-taught programmer from Belgium, 15 years earlier than MIT scientists expected. Bernard Fabrot spent the last three and a half years computing the solution to a puzzle first announced by MIT researchers in 1999. Separately, another team led by tech executive Simon Peffers is nearing completion of computing a solution. The puzzle essentially involves doing roughly 80 trillion successive squarings of a starting number, and was specifically designed to foil anyone trying to solve it more quickly by using parallel computing. Fabrot and Peffers took very different approaches to the puzzle. Fabrot used a simple Intel Core i7-6700 found in consumer PCs, and computed the solution using the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP)."</em> <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/news/programmers-solve-mits-20-year-old-cryptographic-puzzle">[...]</a>

<p><em>"India’s electronics market is in its biggest boom ever. Fuelled by the demand for electronic devices, it is expected to reach a whopping $400 billion by 2020. Most of the electronic devices we use are imported; only a quarter of the devices are produced in the country. According to statistics, electronic goods in India account for more than 10% of total imports, second only to petroleum products! One electronic equipment that is almost always imported is the microprocessor—the ‘brain’ of an electronic device. A microprocessor is an integrated circuit (IC) that contains a few millions of transistors (semiconductor-based electronic devices) fused on a semiconductor chip."</em> <a href="https://researchmatters.in/news/welcome-ajit-%E2%80%98made-india%E2%80%99-microprocessor">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Astronomers using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope say they have crossed an important threshold in revealing a discrepancy between the two key techniques for measuring the universe's expansion rate. The recent study strengthens the case that new theories may be needed to explain the forces that have shaped the cosmos. A brief recap: The universe is getting bigger every second. The space between galaxies is stretching, like dough rising in the oven. But how fast is the universe expanding? As Hubble and other telescopes seek to answer this question, they have run into an intriguing difference between what scientists predict and what they observe."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/mystery-of-the-universe-s-expansion-rate-widens-with-new-hubble-data">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/27/18519778/spacex-starlink-fcc-approval-satellite-internet-constellation-lower-orbit">FCC approves SpaceX's plans to fly internet-beaming satellites in a lower orbit</a></h2>

<p><em>"The Federal Communications Commission has approved SpaceX’s request to fly a large swath of its future internet-beaming satellites at a lower orbit than originally planned. The approval was a major regulatory hurdle the company needed to clear in order to start launching its first operational satellites from Florida next month. In November, SpaceX sent a request to the FCC to partially revise plans for the company’s satellite internet constellation, known as Starlink. Under SpaceX’s original agreement with the commission, the company had permission to launch 4,425 Starlink satellites into orbits that ranged between 1,110 to 1,325 kilometers up. But then SpaceX decided it wanted to fly 1,584 of those satellites in different orbits, thanks to what it had learned from its first two test satellites, TinTin A and B. Instead of flying them at 1,150 kilometers, the company now wants to fly them much lower at 550 kilometers."</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/27/18519778/spacex-starlink-fcc-approval-satellite-internet-constellation-lower-orbit">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Twenty years ago, in April 1999, Microsoft introduced an update to its IntelliMouse line of input devices. On top it didn’t look much different than its predecessors—it still had a few buttons and a scroll wheel—but underneath it introduced a technology to the masses that brought an end to the prehistoric days of cleaning dirt and grime out of computer mice. I was a third-year college student at that point, and my digital media program had me spending endless hours in Photoshop, version 5.5, purchased with a much-welcomed student discount. My classes weren’t textbook dependent, which left money for pricey photo-editing software, and a desktop workstation that while powerful at the time, would be laughable today (16MB of RAM baby!). What wasn’t in the budget was a fancy Wacom tablet, which was still primarily targeted at professionals with budgets that could afford such luxuries. I was stuck using a mouse, which at the time relied on an archaic rubber-coated metal ball to translate my hand motions to the cursor on the screen."</em> <a href="https://gizmodo.com/20-years-ago-microsoft-changed-how-we-mouse-forever-1834274151">[...]</a>

Importantly, this process takes place at low temperatures, eliminating the creation of carbon dioxide that would have resulted from an unwanted breaking of carbon-carbon bonds. “The fact that we can make this conversion happen at lower temperatures protects the intermediate dehydrogenation products cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene from being further converted unwanted products.” — Stefan Vajda Cyclohexane is an important starting molecule in a wide range of chemical reactions, according to Argonne chemist Stefan Vajda, now at the J.

On its surface, the work is deceptively simple: Shoot a high-power laser beam onto a piece of metal for a fraction of a second and see what happens. But researchers say the physics of laser welding is surprisingly complex. A better understanding of the interaction between laser and metal could give industry more control over laser welding, a technology that is becoming increasingly popular in manufacturing. For the past three years, scientists at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have been collecting data on the most fundamental aspects of laser welding. The scope of their study is narrow, but the measurements of this complicated process are more accurate and comprehensive than any data ever collected on the subject, the researchers say."</em> <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2019/04/nist-research-sparks-new-insights-laser-welding">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A new generation of ultrafast process technology is on the market. Higher average laser power and greater pulse energy promise higher throughput and efficiency. When processing microfilters, for example, this makes it possible to drill hole sizes down to below one micrometer much more quickly. When scaling the processes, there are some non-trivial interaction mechanisms to contend with, which were one of the topics of the “5th UKP-Workshop: Ultrafast Laser Technology“ in Aachen. Ultrafast lasers with pulse durations in the picosecond and femtosecond range have experienced a major boom over the past few years. Several innovations in process technology permit ultrafast laser processes to be used in industrial fields such as consumer electronics."</em> <a href="https://www.ilt.fraunhofer.de/en/press/press-releases/press-release-2019/press-release-2019-3-13.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2019/may/high-thermal-conductivity-.html">New material to pave the way for more efficient electronic devices</a></h2>

<p><em>"Researchers at the University of Bristol have successfully demonstrated the high thermal conductivity of a new material, paving the way for safer and more efficient electronic devices – including mobile phones, radars and even electric cars. The team, led by Professor Martin Kuball at the Center for Device Thermography and Reliability (CDTR)[MK1] , found that by making an ultra-pure version of Boron Nitride it was possible to demonstrate its thermal conductivity potential for the first time, which at 550W/mk is twice that of copper. The paper: Modulating the thermal conductivity in hexagonal boron nitride via controlled boron isotope concentration is published today in Communications Physics. Professor Kuball explained: “Most semiconductor electronics heat up when used. The hotter they get, the greater the rate at which they degrade, and their performance diminishes. As we rely more and more upon our electronic devices, it becomes increasingly important to find materials with high thermal conductivity which can extract waste heat."</em> <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2019/may/high-thermal-conductivity-.html">[...]</a>

The work brings us closer to harnessing quantum technology to make more powerful computers, ultra-sensitive sensors and secure transmissions. “Both of these are transformative steps forward to quantum communications,” said co-author Andrew Cleland, the John A.

This allows the Arduino to test whether the sensor can "see" a particular LED. This process is repeated for each of the 1,024 individual LEDs rapidly to generate a map of visible pixels.

This has been represented in my past published Instructables (See References) and so a challenge was born when I discovered that the geyser in my new home roof space was connected to the mains power 24/7 with no local on/off control and was controlled by a relatively inaccurate internal thermostat not to mention the difficulty to adjust the water temperature setting. The task - how to bring the water temperature control easily to me with an ability to display/record the temperature/power consumption trends over the last 24 hours to allow me to maximise my water temperature when I needed it at the lowest possible power consumption. Main features of the controller include: Water temperature measurement and display Up to 4 extra optional sensors that can be attached to the external skin of the geyser to monitor the geyser external temperatures - used to assess the need for any external geyser insulation. After this exercise is done, you may if you prefer remove the sensors or simply leave them in place to monitor and log the geyser wall temperatures with the water temperature for reference.

So I thought why not combine both ideas and make a single gadget that can do both. At last, I ended up building a device that can not only measure curved lines and surface levelness but can also measure straight line distances and angle of a line. So basically this gadget works as an all in one digital level+ruler+protractor+roll-measure. The device is tiny enough to fit inside a pocket and its batteries can be easily recharged using a phone charger. This device uses an accelerometer and gyroscope sensor to accurately measure surface levelness and angle, a sharp IR sensor to measure the linear length in a non-contact way and an encoder with a wheel which can be rolled over a curved surface or a curved line to get its length."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/DIGITAL-LEVELRULERPROTRACTORROLL-MEASURE/">[...]</a>
