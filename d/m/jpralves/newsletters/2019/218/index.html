<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1883, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg">Rube Goldberg</a>. Este cartoonista norte-americano satirizou a preocupação americana com a tecnologia. O seu nome tornou-se sinonimo de qualquer processo simples tornado estranhamente complicado por causa da sua série de desenhos animados de "Invenção" que usam uma série de ferramentas, pessoas, plantas e passos estranhos para realizar as tarefas simples do dia-a-dia da maneira mais complicada. Goldberg aplicou a sua experiência como engenheiro de pós-graduação e usou suas habilidades de engenharia, capacidade de escrever histórias e de desenho para se certificar de que as “Invenções” pudessem funcionar, embora dezenas de braços, rodas, engrenagens, alças, copos e hastes fossem colocados em movimento por bolas, gaiolas de pássaros, baldes, botas, banheiras, pás e até animais vivos para tarefas simples, como espremer o sumo de uma laranja ou fechar uma janela em caso de começar a chover. Ficou conhecido por ser a inspiração para as máquinas de Rube Goldberg.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1961, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich">Brendan Eich</a>. Este norte-americano ficou conhecido por ser o criador da versão original da linguagem de programação Javascript. A primeira versão foi concluída em dez dias, a fim de cumprir o calendário de lançamentos do Netscape Navigator 2.0 Beta, e foi designada por Mocha, mas renomeada como LiveScript em Setembro de 1995 e posteriormente JavaScript no mesmo mês.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que a Google está a preparar a instalação de um novo cabo submarino no oceano Atlântico entre Portugal e a África do Sul. Designado por Equiano, quando estiver completo este passará a ser o terceiro cabo internacional privado depois da Dunant e do Curie e o 14º investimento em cabos submarinos globalmente. Esperando que a instalação esteja completa em 2021 este novo cabo terá cerca de 20 mais capacidade que o ultimo cabo construído para servir esta região.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. É apresentada também a revista newelectronics de 25 de Junho.</p>

<p><em>"Today we are introducing Equiano, our new private subsea cable that will connect Africa with Europe. Once complete, Equiano will start in western Europe and run along the West Coast of Africa, between Portugal and South Africa, with branching units along the way that can be used to extend connectivity to additional African countries. The first branch is expected to land in Nigeria. This new cable is fully funded by Google, making it our third private international cable after Dunant and Curie, and our 14th subsea cable investment globally. Google’s private subsea cables all carry the names of historical luminaries, and Equiano is no different. Named for Olaudah Equiano, a Nigerian-born writer and abolitionist who was enslaved as a boy, the Equiano cable is state-of-the-art infrastructure based on space-division multiplexing (SDM) technology, with approximately 20 times more network capacity than the last cable built to serve this region."</em> <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure/introducing-equiano-a-subsea-cable-from-portugal-to-south-africa">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Deep learning algorithms are a core element of artificial intelligence (AI) as they are the processes by which a computer is able to think and learn like a human being does. A Neural Processing Unit (NPU) is a processor that is optimized for deep learning algorithm computation, designed to efficiently process thousands of these computations simultaneously. Samsung Electronics last month announced its goal to strengthen its leadership in the global system semiconductor industry by 2030 through expanding its proprietary NPU technology development. The company recently delivered an update to this goal at the conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), one of the top academic conferences in computer vision fields. This update is the company’s development of its On-Device AI lightweight algorithm, introduced at CVPR with a paper titled “Learning to Quantize Deep Networks by Optimizing Quantization Intervals With Task Loss”.

<p><em>"The critical launch abort system for NASA's Orion spacecraft was put to its hardest test today, and it demonstrated its capability to pull the crew module and future astronauts to safety during a launch if there is an emergency. Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) designed and built the launch abort system for the test and is also the prime contractor building the Orion spacecraft for NASA. The Ascent Abort-2 flight test is a major test milestone that is enabling the safe passage of astronauts aboard Orion on the Artemis missions to the Moon and then Mars. During the test this morning from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida, the Orion launch abort system, with a mock-up Orion capsule, was launched on a modified Peacekeeper missile. At 31,000 feet, or about six miles up, into the flight, the on-board computers initiated the abort sequence. The launch abort motors, generating 400,000 pounds of thrust, then pulled the Orion capsule away from the rocket which was already traveling nearly 1,000 mph."</em> <a href="https://news.lockheedmartin.com/2019-07-02-Ensuring-Astronaut-Safety-Lockheed-Martin-and-NASA-Successfully-Demonstrate-Orion-Launch-Abort-System-in-Flight-Test">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Three of the 60 satellites SpaceX launched last month to begin its broadband megaconstellation have lost contact with ground control teams, a SpaceX spokesperson said June 28. Those three satellites will deorbit "passively," the spokesperson said, meaning Earth's gravity and atmospheric drag will pull them down until they burn up in the atmosphere. Observers had noticed some Starlink satellites had not initiated orbit raising after being released May 23 from a Falcon 9 upper stage into a 440-kilometer low Earth orbit. SpaceX said May 31 that all 60 satellites were initially responsive. SpaceX's spokesperson, in their June 28 statement, said the company will intentionally deorbit two functioning satellites as well, in order to test the spacecraft's ability to propulsively deorbit. "Three satellites which initially communicated with the ground but are no longer in service, will passively deorbit," the spokesperson said."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-loses-contact-with-3-starlink-satellites.html">[...]</a>

Mazda Motor Corp, Suzuki Motor Corp, Subaru Corp, Isuzu Motors and Toyota unit Daihatsu will each take a stake of a few percent in the venture, the sources said. With the move to autonomous driving and electric vehicles creating ructions across the industry and spawning once unlikely partnerships, the venture, Monet, which is developing an on-demand self-driving service platform, hopes to help Japan’s auto industry ride the shift. Monet, announced in October, added investment from Honda Motor Co and Toyota’s truck making subsidiary Hino Motors in March, leaving SoftBank Corp the largest shareholder with a 40.2% share and Toyota owning 39.8%. When Honda and Hino joined in March, the total investment in Monet was 2.5 billion yen ($23.20 million). It was not immediately clear how much the five new partners are investing in the venture."</em> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-softbank-toyota-monet-autonomous/softbank-toyotas-self-driving-car-venture-to-add-five-more-automakers-sources-idUSKCN1TS074">[...]</a>

In their paper published in the journal Science, the group describes how they happened to spot the new property and possible uses for it. Scientists have long known about such properties of light as wavelength. More recently, researchers have found that light can also be twisted, a property called angular momentum. Beams with highly structured angular momentum are said to have orbital angular momentum (OAM), and are called vortex beams. They appear as a helix surrounding a common center, and when they strike a flat surface, they appear as doughnut-shaped."</em> <a href="https://phys.org/news/2019-06-property.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Electrolyte additives can boost lithium-ion battery temperature range New additives can help lithium-ion batteries perform over a wider range of temperatures, a potential boon for electric cars, a new study finds. Electric cars struggle with extreme temperatures, which can degrade the electrolyte solutions that conduct ions between the negative electrodes, or anodes, and positive electrodes, or cathodes, within lithium-ion batteries. A key additive to most of these electrolyte solutions is ethylene carbonate, which helps produce a protective layer that prevents further decomposition of electrolyte components when they interact with the anode. However, ethylene carbonate has a high melting point, which limits its performance at low temperatures. Materials scientist Wu Xu at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Washington, and his colleagues previously showed they could extend the temperature range of lithium-ion batteries by partially replacing ethylene carbonate with propylene carbonate and adding cesium hexafluorophosphate. However, they wanted to improve the temperature range of lithium-ion batteries even further, so they could perform well from -40 to 60 degrees C. In the new study, Xu and his colleagues tested the effects of five electrolyte additives on the performance of lithium-ion batteries within this temperature range."</em> <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/energywise/green-tech/fuel-cells/lithium-additives">[...]</a>

The study has big implications for quantum information technology - the future of how sensitive information is shared and stored. The researchers published their results on June 28, 2019 in Communications Physics. "Quantum teleportation permits the transfer of quantum information into an otherwise inaccessible space," said Hideo Kosaka, a professor of engineering at Yokohama National University and an author on the study.

<p><em>"A joint team of scientists at the University of California, Riverside, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is getting closer to confirming the existence of an exotic quantum particle called Majorana fermion, crucial for fault-tolerant quantum computing — the kind of quantum computing that addresses errors during its operation. Quantum computing uses quantum phenomena to perform computations. Majorana fermions exist at the boundary of special superconductors called topological superconductors, which have a superconducting gap in their interiors and harbor Majorana fermions outside, at their boundaries. Majorana fermions are one of the most sought-after objects in quantum physics because they are their own antiparticles, they can split the quantum state of an electron in half, and they follow different statistics compared to electrons. Though many have claimed to have identified them, scientists still cannot confirm their exotic quantum nature. The UCR-MIT team overcame the challenge by developing a new heterostructure material system, based on gold, that could be potentially used to demonstrate the existence and quantum nature of Majorana fermions."</em> <a href="https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2019/06/28/new-material-shows-high-potential-quantum-computing">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Harvard/Argonne team clears up a decades-old mystery about the reverse Hall effect in high-temperature superconductors. Phase transitions occur when a substance changes from a solid, liquid or gaseous state to a different state — like ice melting or vapor condensing. During these phase transitions, there is a point at which the system can display properties of both states of matter simultaneously. A similar effect occurs when normal metals transition into superconductors — characteristics fluctuate and properties expected to belong to one state carry into the other. Scientists at Harvard have developed a bismuth-based, two-dimensional superconductor that is only one nanometer thick. By studying fluctuations in this ultra-thin material as it transitions into superconductivity, the scientists gained insight into the processes that drive superconductivity more generally."</em> <a href="https://www.anl.gov/article/confirmation-of-old-theory-leads-to-new-breakthrough-in-superconductor-science">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Material developed at MIT can passively capture solar heat for home heating or industrial applications. A newly developed material that is so perfectly transparent you can barely see it could unlock many new uses for solar heat. It generates much higher temperatures than conventional solar collectors do — enough to be used for home heating or for industrial processes that require heat of more than 200 degrees Celsius (392 degrees Fahrenheit). The key to the process is a new kind of aerogel, a lightweight material that consists mostly of air, with a structure made of silica (which is also used to make glass). The material lets sunlight pass through easily but blocks solar heat from escaping. The findings are described in the journal ACS Nano, in a paper by Lin Zhao, an MIT graduate student; Evelyn Wang, professor and head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering; Gang Chen, the Carl Richard Soderberg Professor in Power Engineering; and five others."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/aerogel-passive-heat-sunlight-0702">[...]</a>

<p><em>"People with chronic diseases like arthritis, diabetes and heart disease may one day forego the daily regimen of pills and, instead, receive a scheduled dosage of medication through a grape-sized implant that is remotely controlled. Researchers from Houston Methodist successfully delivered continuous, predetermined dosages of two chronic disease medications using a nanochannel delivery system (nDS) that they remotely controlled using Bluetooth technology. The nDS device provides controlled release of drugs without the use of pumps, valves or a power supply for possibly up to year without a refill for some patients. This technology will be tested in space next year. A proof-of-concept paper recently published in Lab on a Chip (online June 25) explains how the Houston Methodist nanomedicine researchers accomplished long-term delivery of drugs for rheumatoid arthritis and high blood pressure, medications that are often administered at specific times of the day or at varying dosages based on patient needs. “We see this universal drug implant as part of the future of health care innovation."</em> <a href="https://www.houstonmethodist.org/newsroom/remote-controlled-drug-delivery-implant-the-size-of-a-grape-may-help-chronic-disease-management/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Mobile motor could pave the way for robots to assemble complex structures — including other robots. Years ago, MIT Professor Neil Gershenfeld had an audacious thought. Struck by the fact that all the world’s living things are built out of combinations of just 20 amino acids, he wondered: Might it be possible to create a kit of just 20 fundamental parts that could be used to assemble all of the different technological products in the world? Gershenfeld and his students have been making steady progress in that direction ever since. Their latest achievement, presented this week at an international robotics conference, consists of a set of five tiny fundamental parts that can be assembled into a wide variety of functional devices, including a tiny “walking” motor that can move back and forth across a surface or turn the gears of a machine. Previously, Gershenfeld and his students showed that structures assembled from many small, identical subunits can have numerous mechanical properties."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/micro-robots-walk-0702">[...]</a>

Physicists from Professor Johannes Fink’s research group at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (IST Austria) have found a way to use a mechanical oscillator to produce entangled radiation. This method, which the authors published in the current edition of Nature, might prove extremely useful when it comes to connecting quantum computers. Entanglement is a phenomenon typical of the quantum world, which is not present in the so-called classical world — the world and laws of physics that govern our everyday lives. When two particles are entangled, the characteristics of one particle can be determined by looking at the other. This was discovered by Einstein, and the phenomenon is now actively used in quantum cryptography where it is said to lead to unbreakable codes."</em> <a href="https://ist.ac.at/en/news/building-a-bridge-to-the-quantum-world/">[...]</a>

Gen also lets expert researchers write sophisticated models and inference algorithms — used for prediction tasks — that were previously infeasible. In their paper, for instance, the researchers demonstrate that a short Gen program can infer 3-D body poses, a difficult computer-vision inference task that has applications in autonomous systems, human-machine interactions, and augmented reality. Behind the scenes, this program includes components that perform graphics rendering, deep-learning, and types of probability simulations."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/ai-programming-gen-0626">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A new study reveals a suite of quantum Hall states that have not been seen previously, shedding new light on the nature of electron interactions in quantum systems and establishing a potential new platform for future quantum computers. Researchers from Brown and Columbia Universities have demonstrated previously unknown states of matter that arise in double-layer stacks of graphene, a two-dimensional nanomaterial. These new states, manifestations of what’s known as the fractional quantum Hall effect, arise from the complex interactions of electrons both within each graphene layer as well as across layers. “The findings show that stacking 2D materials together in close proximity generates entirely new physics,” said Jia Li, assistant professor of physics at Brown, who initiated this work as a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia working with Cory Dean, professor of physics and Jim Hone, professor of mechanical engineering. “In terms of materials engineering, this work shows that these layered systems could be viable in creating new types of electronic devices that take advantage of these new quantum Hall states.” The research is published in the journal Nature Physics.

Data augmentation is one important tool, especially in situations where there isn’t enough training data, that improves learning by synthesizing new training samples automatically. Such is the case for few-shot learning, where only one or very few samples are available per category. Most prior work on few-shot classification for images investigates the ‘single label’ scenario, where every training image contains only a single object and hence has a single category label. However, a more challenging and realistic scenario is multi-label, few-shot image classification where training data has a small number of samples, and images have more than one label, which has not been explored extensively in prior work. In order to advance this topic, we investigate multi-label, few-shot image classification in our paper presented at IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR 2019) in June 2019."</em> <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2019/06/few-shot-learning/">[...]</a>

Once I figured out the start and end positions and figured out how much it would be required to be rotated (clockwise or counter clockwise), I created ratios. These ratios were then the test bed for creating gears... I found a great tool online that provides real time rotational information, and at a very reasonable price at that (it took quite a few trials and errors when actually cutting out the materials, and finding out that I actually really needed a central hub on each gear - this was actually quite educational to say the least) GearGenerator (including the gear set that is used here) the SVG of the gear set is included here With the SVG downloaded, I was able to import it in to Adobe Illustrator Supplies: laser cutter hard board card stock 6-32 x 2" machine screws (x6) 6-32 x 3/4" machine screws (x5) 6-32 machine screw nuts (x6) glue (wood glue works great on hardboard) paint Arduino (nano preferred) 9V battery + plus battery clip NeoPixel strip stepper motor (28BYJ-48 was used here) push buttons (x4) wire soldering iron + solder"</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Eye-of-Agamotto-With-Arduino/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2KGV">Magic 3D Clock</a></h2>

<p><em>"This clock displays the time as an autostereogram on a colour TFT display. The time is invisible until you view it with your eyes focussed in the distance, when the time will jump out in 3D, appearing as four digits. It uses an ATtiny85 driving a TFT 160x80 colour display, and the timekeeping is done by a DS1302 RTC chip. Introduction This isn't perhaps the most convenient way of seeing the time, but it's a fun demonstration of autostereograms, made popular by the Magic Eye books of the 1990s. It's ideal if you don't want to be constantly reminded of the time, but want to be able to check it when you need it. To view the clock you need to focus on a point behind the clock until the random dots snap together to create a new image, with the time shown in 3D."</em> <a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2KGV">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Hello there, hope you are doing good and in this tutorial I will be showing you how i made a current sensor for Arduino using some very basic electronic components and a home-made shunt. This shunt can easily handle large magnitude of current, around 10-15 Amps. The accuracy is also pretty good and I was able to get very decent results while measuring low currents around 100mA. Supplies: Arduino Uno or equivalent and programming wire OP- Amp LM358 Jumper wires 100 KOhm resistor 220 KOhm resistor 10 Kohm resistor Veroboard or Zero PCB board Shunt(8 to 10 milliohms) The main parts you would need for this build is a Shunt along with the operational amplifier IC. For my application I am using the IC LM358 which is a dual OP-AMP 8 pin DIP IC of which I am using only one of the operational amplifier. You will also be needing resistors for the Non-inverting amplifier circuit."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Current-Sensor-for-Arduino/">[...]</a>

It covers the different important points of a manipulation: - the development of the theory of a simple situation, - the characterization of equipment and measurement uncertainties, - the adjustment of the theoretical model to the measurements performed, - criticism of the results obtained and - what improvement can be done to the manipulation. Manipulation consists of dropping an object and measuring the time it takes for it to travel different distances in order to determine gravitational acceleration. Supplies: For this project, you will need: 1 arduino 2 LEDs (+ adapted resistances if needed) 2 photoresistors 1 marble 2 strong magnets a 10 kΩ resistance Some conductive wires Breadboard (optional) You should also have access to a 3D printer and to a soldering iron.

In this instructable I will be showing how to make a new tool for improving your microcontroller projects. When making embedded microcontroller projects, like a binary wrist watch, you usually optimize for size and minimal components. This means you it's often necessary to not include components only needed for initial set up, but instead just the components needed for continual operation. This means the microcontroller usually gets programmed from another programming circuit. Soldering and desoldering a programming circuit can be a hassle if you want to continue developing the embedded code, and this is the problem this tool will solve!"</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Combined-ISP-and-FTDI-Tool-With-Pogo-Pins/">[...]</a>

Originally artmaker43 developed Fibonnaci Clock.exe and Fibonnaci Clock Screensaver.exe, Windows executables that use the first five numbers of the Fibonnaci sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5) using squares with those values along each side. This simulates counting all the way to 12. Then by keeping track of the number of 12s (plus the values less than 12) with painted squares, one can construct a 24-hour clock. This Fibonacci clock version is a little bit different to the original one: The clock is divided into three independents zones: hours, minutes and seconds that use the Fibonacci sequence (1,2,3,5) to simulate counting all the way to 12. In the minute and second zones we can find 4 labeled circles lighted by leds: 12, 24, 36 and 48 to indicate when the counting is greater than the ones In the hour zone we can find one labeled circle (PM) to indicate when the current hour is on the second 12-hour period (from noon to midnight)."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/RGB-Fibonacci-Clock/">[...]</a>
