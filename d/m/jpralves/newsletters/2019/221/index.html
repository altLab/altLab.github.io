<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1857, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_J._Sprague">Frank J. Sprague</a>. Este engenheiro americano, inventor foi pioneiro no transporte ferroviário eléctrico. Ele começou a sua carreira no mar na Marinha dos EUA (1878). Mais tarde, ele trabalhou no Brooklyn Navy Yard fazendo planos para lâmpadas eléctricas incandescentes em navios da Marinha, o que levou a juntar-se a Edison em Menlo Park (1883) Ele formou a Sprague Electric Railway Motor Company em 1884, e ficou conhecido como "o pai de tracção ferroviária eléctrica. " quando ele instalou o primeiro sistema de carrinho eléctrico americano (Richmond, Va., 1887). Edison assumiu esta empresa em 1892. Sprague ganhou muitas patentes, muitas para aplicações ferroviárias e diversas ideias, como torradeiras eléctricas, sinais eléctricos, elevadores eléctricos e armamento naval.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1874, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Lebedev_(chemist)">Sergey Lebedev</a>. Este químico russo desenvolveu um método para produção industrial de borracha sintética. Em 1910, enquanto pesquisava processos pelos quais pequenas moléculas combinavam-se para formar grandes, Lebedev fez uma borracha elástica pela polimerização do butadieno (CH2CH-CHCH2), que ele obteve do álcool etílico. A produção de polibutadieno na União Soviética usando o processo de Lebedev foi iniciada em 1932-33, usando batatas e calcário como matéria-prima. Em 1940, a União Soviética tinha a maior indústria de borracha sintética do mundo, produzindo mais de 50.000 toneladas por ano. Durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial, o seu processo de obtenção de butadieno a partir do álcool etílico também foi usado pela indústria alemã de borracha.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1920, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalind_Franklin">Rosalind Franklin</a>. Esta química, física inglesa e cristalógrafa de raios-X contribuiu para a descoberta da estrutura molecular do ácido desoxirribonucleico (DNA), um constituinte dos cromossomas que serve para codificar a informação genética. Começando em 1951, ela fez fotografias cuidadosas de difracção de raios X do DNA, levando-a a suspeitar da forma helicoidal da molécula, pelo menos nas condições que ela tinha usado. Quando James Watson viu suas fotografias, ele confirmou a forma de dupla hélice que ele e Francis Crick publicaram. Ela nunca recebeu o reconhecimento que merecia por seu trabalho independente.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou comemorou-se o 50.o aniversário da ida do Homem à Lua. Uma das figuras mais importantes para que pudesse ser concretizado esse objectivo foi Margaret Hamilton. Esta engenheira de software foi a pessoa responsável pela equipa que desenvolveu software de voo on-board para o programa espacial Apollo da NASA incluindo o da Apollo 11 que aterrou na Lua. Em seu tributo a Google desenvolveu um software que reposicionou os mais de 107.000 espelhos no Ivanpah Solar Facility, no deserto de Mojave, para reflectir a luz da Lua, em vez do Sol, como os espelhos costumam fazer. O resultado é um retrato de 1,4 quilómetros quadrados de Margaret, maior do que o Central Park de Nova York.</p>

<p>Também esta semana, e após uma tentativa falhada, a nave Chandrayaan-2 de fabrico Indiano, foi lançada da Terra em direcção à Lua. Com 3840 kg, a nave faz parte do objectivo da India de desenvolver e demonstrar as principais tecnologias para a capacidade de missão lunar ponta-a-ponta, incluindo pouso suave e movimentação na superfície lunar. Esta missão visa expandir ainda mais o nosso conhecimento sobre a Lua através de um estudo detalhado da sua topografia, mineralogia, composição química da superfície, características termo-físicas e atmosfera levando a uma melhor compreensão da origem e evolução da mesma.</p>

<p>Esta semana que passou também a estação espacial chinesa Tiangong-2 finalmente despenhou-se na Terra. Depois de orbitar a Terra 16.209 vezes, ela ardeu em chamas na reentrada na atmosfera terrestre. O laboratório espacial da China, Tiangong-2, reentrou na atmosfera da Terra sob controle na noite de sexta-feira passada, com uma pequena quantidade de destroços caindo na área marítima predeterminada do Pacífico Sul, informou a Agência Espacial Chinesa.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. É apresentada também a revista MagPI Nº84 de Agosto e a revista newelectronics de 23 Julho.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/50-years-ago-apollo-11-returns-to-houston">50 Years Ago: Apollo 11 Returns to Houston</a></h2>

<p><em>"Apollo 11 splashed down 950 miles southwest of Hawaii on July 24, 1969. The Command Module (CM) Columbia and the crew of Neil A. Armstrong, Edwin E. “Buzz” Aldrin, and Michael Collins were successfully recovered and delivered aboard the prime recovery ship the aircraft carrier USS Hornet (CVS-12). Requirements to prevent back contamination of the Earth with any possible lunar microorganisms made the Apollo 11 recovery the most complicated in spaceflight history. Once aboard the carrier, the astronauts entered the Mobile Quarantine Facility (MQF) along with NASA flight surgeon Dr. William R. Carpentier and NASA recovery engineer John K. Hirasaki. The goal was to return the astronauts, Columbia, and the lunar samples and film magazines to the Lunar Receiving Laboratory (LRL) at the Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC), now the Johnson Space Center in Houston, as expeditiously as possible while maintaining the strict biological isolation protocols. Within hours after splashdown, Hirasaki retrieved the Moon rocks contained in two Apollo Lunar Sample Return Containers (ALSRC), film magazines, and other items from Columbia, which was connected to the MQF via a flexible tunnel to maintain biological isolation."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/50-years-ago-apollo-11-returns-to-houston">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-07/20/c_138243358.htm">Bidding farewell to Tiangong-2, China prepares for space station</a></h2>

<p><em>"After orbiting the earth 16,209 times, it burned itself into ashes, flaming out in a dazzling display as its last gift to humanity. China's space lab Tiangong-2 reentered the earth's atmosphere under control Friday night, with a small amount of its debris falling into the predetermined safe sea area in the South Pacific, the China Manned Space Agency said. Tiangong-2's controlled reentry into the atmosphere marks the successful completion of all the tasks in the space lab phase in China's manned space program, said Zhou Jianping, chief designer of China's manned space program. "It's hard to say goodbye to Tiangong-2, but considering reliability- and safety-related factors, we have to drive it out of orbit," said Zhu Zongpeng, chief designer of Tiangong-2 from the China Academy of Space Technology. "To let Tiangong-2 'retire' by choice is to ensure the absolute safety of its departure," Zhu said. "As the first to enter Tiangong-2, I'm happy that the space lab has successfully completed its tasks, though I'm also missing it since it was our home in space," said astronaut Jing Haipeng, who spent his 50th birthday on Tiangong-2 on Oct. 24, 2016."</em> <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-07/20/c_138243358.htm">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/margaret-hamilton-apollo-11-tribute/">A moonlit tribute to a moon landing icon</a></h2>

<p><em>"“There was no choice but to be pioneers.” That’s how Margaret Hamilton describes working on the software that put us on the moon. Margaret led the team that developed the onboard flight software for all of NASA’s manned Apollo missions, including Apollo 11’s historic moon landing. With the anniversary of that moon landing approaching, Google set out to shine a light on Margaret’s influence on Apollo, and on the field of software engineering itself. The tribute was created by positioning over 107,000 mirrors at the Ivanpah Solar Facility in the Mojave Desert to reflect the light of the moon, instead of the sun, like the mirrors normally do. The result is a 1.4-square-mile portrait of Margaret, bigger than New York’s Central Park. At the MIT Instrumentation Lab in the 1960s, Margaret was working on code for the Apollo Guidance Computer."</em> <a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/margaret-hamilton-apollo-11-tribute/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., a subsidiary of Qualcomm Incorporated, today announced an expansion of its 5G NR testing facilities in Europe to include a new lab dedicated to end-to-end over-the-air (OTA) configurations for 5G NR millimeter wave (mmWave). Located at Qualcomm Technologies’ research and development (R&amp;D) center in Farnborough, UK, the new 5G mmWave lab and test facility will demonstrate and facilitate commercialization of 5G NR mmWave capabilities by allowing OEMs and European operators to test and fine-tune mmWave devices and network configurations. On the heels of the new 5G R&amp;D facility launching, Qualcomm Technologies and Sony have announced that Sony will be the first OEM to take advantage of the lab. Sony will provide pre-commercial mmWave mobile form factor devices to the facility to test the capacity, throughput, latency and reliability of mmWave in multiple deployment scenarios. For dense urban environments, indoor venues and enterprises, mmWave brings massive capacity, multi-Gigabit peak throughput and low-latency connectivity to smartphones, laptops and more. In addition, the ability to carry higher data rates for users makes 5G perfect for deployment in high-density indoor environments such as stadia and shopping centers, often as a complementary technology for sub-6 5G deployments."</em> <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2019/07/24/qualcomm-introduces-end-end-over-air-5g-mmwave-test-network-europe-drive-5g">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Robots and prosthetic devices may soon have a sense of touch equivalent to, or better than, the human skin with the Asynchronous Coded Electronic Skin (ACES), an artificial nervous system developed by a team of NUS researchers. The new electronic skin system has ultra-high responsiveness and robustness to damage, and can be paired with any kind of sensor skin layers to function effectively as an electronic skin. The innovation, achieved by Assistant Professor Benjamin Tee and his team from NUS Materials Science and Engineering, was first reported in prestigious scientific journal Science Robotics on 18 July 2019. Faster than the human sensory nervous system “Humans use our sense of touch to accomplish almost every daily task, such as picking up a cup of coffee or making a handshake. Without it, we will even lose our sense of balance when walking. Similarly, robots need to have a sense of touch in order to interact better with humans, but robots today still cannot feel objects very well,” explained Asst Prof Tee, who has been working on electronic skin technologies for over a decade in hopes of giving robots and prosthetic devices a better sense of touch."</em> <a href="http://news.nus.edu.sg/research/exceptional-touch-robots-prosthetics">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Increasing development of micro-scale electronics has stimulated demand of the corresponding micro-scale power sources, especially for micro-batteries (MBs). However, complex manufacturing process and poor flexibility of the traditional stacked batteries have hindered their practical applications. Planar MBs have recently garnered great attention due to their simple miniaturization, facile serial/parallel integration and capability of working without separator membranes. Furthermore, planar geometry has extremely short ion diffusion pathway, which is attributed to full integration of printed electronics on a single substrate. Also, in order to get rid of the safety issues induced by the flammable organic electrolyte, the aqueous electrolyte, characterized by intrinsic nonflammability, high ionic conductivity, and nontoxicity, is a promising candidate for large-scale wearable and flexible MB applications. As the consequence, various printing techniques have been used for fabricating planar aqueous MBs."</em> <a href="http://english.cas.cn/newsroom/research_news/201907/t20190711_212892.shtml">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A group of physicists at UNSW Sydney have built a super-fast version of the central building block of a quantum computer. The research is the milestone result of a vision first outlined by scientists 20 years ago. A group of scientists led by 2018 Australian of the Year Professor Michelle Simmons have achieved the first two-qubit gate between atom qubits in silicon – a major milestone on the team’s quest to build an atom-scale quantum computer. The pivotal piece of research was published today in world-renowned journal Nature. A two-qubit gate is the central building block of any quantum computer – and the UNSW team’s version of it is the fastest that’s ever been demonstrated in silicon, completing an operation in 0.8 nanoseconds, which is ~200 times faster than other existing spin-based two-qubit gates. In the Simmons’ group approach, a two-qubit gate is an operation between two electron spins – comparable to the role that classical logic gates play in conventional electronics."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/science-tech/200-times-faster-ever-speediest-quantum-operation-yet">[...]</a>

<p><em>"DGIST announced on Tuesday, July 16 that Senior Researcher Dae-gun Oh’s team in the Collaborative Robots Research Center developed a radar system that can detect subminiature drones that are 3km away. This research is expected to make huge contributions to strengthening domestic industries and defense capabilities by securing a world-class radar sensing technology. As a result of discovering a North Korean drone in Paju in March 2014, South Korea’s Ministry of National Defense has adopted a drone detection radar based on an overseas technology. Since last year, the ministry has devoted itself into building a combat system using drones and training specialized personnel by forming a drone unit to strengthen its defense capability. The necessity of enemy surveillance reconnaissance and the early detection of offensive drones has increased in Korea. Due to the lack of radar detection technology, however, South Korea is using many radar systems from abroad such as drone detection radars from RADA in Israel and Blighter in the U.K. RADA especially owns a superior radar technology performance that can detect drones that are a maximum of 3km away."</em> <a href="https://www.dgist.ac.kr/en/html/sub06/060202.html?mode=V&amp;no=a9fdc6ccd0fb8e43b6b767264b17cf6b">[...]</a>

The same chip works as a photonic quantum processor. Manipulating light on a chip is now possible on a very advanced level, especially using combinations of materials. It is now possible to build optical waveguides with very low losses, using silicon nitride; or very narrow laser light sources using indium phosphide.

<p><em>"University of Illinois electrical engineers have cleared another hurdle in high-power semiconductor fabrication by adding the field’s hottest material – beta-gallium oxide – to their arsenal. Beta-gallium oxide is readily available and promises to convert power faster and more efficiently than today’s leading semiconductor materials – gallium nitride and silicon, the researchers said. Their findings are published in the journal ACS Nano. Flat transistors have become about as small as is physically possible, but researchers addressed this problem by going vertical. With a technique called metal-assisted chemical etching – or MacEtch – U. of I. engineers used a chemical solution to etch semiconductor into 3D fin structures. The fins increase the surface area on a chip, allowing for more transistors or current, and can therefore handle more power while keeping the chip’s footprint the same size."</em> <a href="https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/801428">[...]</a>

Quantum mechanics, the fundamental theory of the atomic world, states that energy is released or absorbed in tiny parcels, or packets, called quanta. Atoms release light energy by radiating photons, or quanta of light. When caught in a trap by researchers, atoms’ motional energy is carried by phonons, or quanta of motion. In addition to creating single numbers of quanta, the NIST team controlled the pendulumlike motion of their ion to simultaneously exhibit two different amounts of motional quanta: zero (minimum motion) plus any number up to 18.

Produced by the incomplete combustion of fuels – emitted from large trucks, trains, and marine vessels – it is an air pollutant of particular concern to residents in urban areas. Sensors available on the market today are expensive, making black carbon difficult to track. Researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), collaborating with UC Berkeley, have developed a new type of sensor network that is much more affordable yet capable of tracking this particulate matter. With more than 100 custom-built sensors installed across West Oakland for 100 days, the team created the largest black carbon monitoring network to be deployed in a single city.

<p><em>"Which uses more water - a bath or a shower? I was recently thinking about this question, and I realized that I don't actually know how much water is used when I shower. I know when I'm in the shower sometimes my mind wanders, thinking about a cool new projects idea or trying to decide what to have for breakfast, while water is just gushing down the drain. It would be a lot easier to reduce my water consumption if I actually knew how many litres I was using each time! I did a bit of research, and found that different shower heads can use anywhere from 9.5 litres (2.5 gallons) per minute to less than 6 litres (1.6 gallons) per minute, if you have a flow restrictor installed. A very old shower could use even more water."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Save-Water-With-the-Shower-Water-Monitor/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A 3D rotational persistence of vision display DESCRIPTION A previous project of mine was a 6x6x6 led cube, and while I was pretty happy with the way it came out, I thought a display with more resolution would be cooler. However, the exponential increase in effort required to construct a larger in constructing a larger LED cube put me off on the idea. Making a rotational display like this seemed like a good way of getting the extra resolution I wanted, without having to spend lots of effort soldering hundreds of leds. So it felt like a good project to take on. If I can iron out all the bugs with the design, I'd really like to streamline the overall design to make it easier to produce. As a longer term goal for the project, I really like the idea of making a kitable version of this."</em> <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/159306-volumetric-pov-display">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The inverted pendulum is a classic problem in dynamics and control theory that is generally elaborated in high-school and undergraduate physics or math courses. Being a math and science enthusiast myself, I decided to try and implement the concepts that I learned during my classes to build an inverted pendulum. Applying such concepts in real life not only helps strengthen your understanding of the concepts but also exposes you to a whole new dimension of problems and challenges that deal with practicality and real-life situations that one can never encounter in theory classes. In this instructable, I will firstly introduce the inverted pendulum problem, then cover the theory aspect of the problem, and then discuss the hardware and software required to bring this concept to life. I suggest you watch the video that is attached above while going through the instructable which will give you a better understanding.

<p><em>"This is an open source keystroke injection device, similar to a well known USB rubber ducky made by hak5. It looks and feels like an ordinary USB flash drive but acts as a keyboard that types in a preprogrammed payload. This can be very useful for automating sysadmin tasks or in penetration testing applications. The device here is intended to be a much improved verison of USB rubber ducky, namely: Made from inexpensive off-the-shelf parts, with not only open source firmware, but hardware design files as well. This allows the user to do substantial modifications to the design, as well as provides an option to build these yourself. Has a built-in interpreter (compatible with existing ducky script) which takes text files directly, so you never have to install any encoder software and keep converting payload.txt to inject.bin."</em> <a href="https://github.com/krakrukra/PocketAdmin">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The ESP32s, are a series of inexpensive microcontrollers, introduced in the last quarter of 2016. They are powerful systems on a chip (SoC) and can replace the ESP2866, and perhaps one might say even the Arduino UNO. Athough, clearly they are much more complex to use. An ESP32 development board contains a 32-bit Tensilica Xtensa LX6 chip, with both dual-core or single-core options available now (and perhaps more options available in the future). They are made using 40 nm fabrications. These chips have PWM, ADC, and DAC capabilities, as well as I2C, SPI, UART, Standard Bluetooth, Bluetooth Low Energy, CAN 2.0, and 2.4 Ghz WiFi interfaces."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/ESP32-Tutorial-Some-Built-In-Capabilities/">[...]</a>
