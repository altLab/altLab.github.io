<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1763, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Nicolas_Vauquelin">Louis Nicolas Vauquelin</a>. Este químico francês ficou conhecido por ter descoberto os elementos crómio (1797) e berílio (1798).</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1821, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pafnuty_Chebyshev">Pafnuty Chebyshev</a>. Este matemático russo fundou a escola matemática de São Petersburgo, e que é lembrado principalmente pelo seu trabalho sobre a teoria dos números primos, incluindo a determinação do número de primos não excedendo um determinado número. Ele escreveu sobre muitos assuntos, incluindo a teoria das congruências em 1849, teoria da probabilidade, formas quadráticas, funções ortogonais, a teoria das integrais, a construção de mapas e o cálculo de volumes geométricos. Chebyshev também estava interessado em mecânica e estudou os problemas envolvidos na conversão de movimento rotativo em movimento rectilíneo por acoplamento mecânico. O movimento paralelo de Chebyshev é formado por três barras interligadas, aproximando-se do movimento rectilíneo.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1831, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Edward_Hughes">David Edward Hughes</a>. Este inventor anglo-americano do microfone de carbono, que foi uma contribuição significativa para a telefonia. A sua família emigrou para os EUA quando ele tinha sete anos. Em 1855, foi-lhe atribuída uma patente dos EUA para o primeiro sistema de telégrafo impresso de texto no envio e na recepção, com um código alfabético especial, conforme exigido pelo código Morse. Foi produzido antes mesmo que a máquina de escrever fosse inventada. Além disso, o microfone de contacto solto da Hughes, inventado em 1878, foi o precursor dos vários microfones de carbono actualmente em uso. Ele também inventou o equilíbrio de indução e trabalhou com a teoria do magnetismo.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1861, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Wightman_Colburn">Irving Wightman Colburn</a>. Este inventor e fabricante norte-americano é responsável pela criação do processo de fabricação de folhas contínuas de vidro plano que tornou possível a produção em massa de vidro para janelas. Colburn começou suas experiências em 1899, que resultaram na sua patente para uma máquina de desenho de chapa de vidro em 25 de março de 1902. Ele formou a Colburn Machine Glass Co. em Agosto de 1906, instalou máquinas de desenho em duas fábricas em 1908, mas faliu em 1911 antes da tecnologia ser aperfeiçoada. A Toledo Glass Company comprou as patentes de Colburn em 1912 e contratou-o logo de seguida. Ele começou a refinar o processo na fábrica experimental da Toledo Glass, onde o seu primeiro desenho de folhas de vidro ocorreu a 25 de Novembro de 1913. Posteriormente, a empresa foi organizada como a Libbey-Owens Sheet Glass Company em 1916. Colburn morreu no ano seguinte antes de poder ver o sucesso total do seu processo.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1934, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Kerr">Roy Kerr</a>. Este matemático neozelandês resolveu (1963) as equações de campo da relatividade geral de Einstein para descrever os buracos negros rotativos, fornecendo assim uma importante contribuição para o campo da astrofísica. Ele deduziu uma família única de soluções de dois parâmetros que descreve o espaço-tempo em torno dos buracos negros em Julho de 1963. Os dois parâmetros são a massa do buraco negro e o momento angular do buraco negro. (A solução estática, com momento angular zero, foi descoberta por Karl Schwarzschild em Dezembro de 1915.) Os buracos negros rotativos são frequentemente chamados de Buracos Negros de Kerr. Ele mostrou que existe uma região semelhante a um vórtice fora do horizonte de eventos, chamada de região ergo, que arrasta o espaço e o tempo com o buraco negro em rotação.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1950, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Bednorz">Georg Bednorz</a>. Este Físico alemão partilhou o Prémio Nobel de Física de 1987 (com Karl Alex Müller) pela descoberta conjunta de supercondutividade numa nova classe de materiais a temperaturas mais altas do que se pensava anteriormente. Eles surpreenderam o mundo apresentando a supercondutividade num material cerâmico em camadas a uma temperatura de 33 Kelvin (33 graus acima do zero absoluto, ou cerca de -460 graus Fahrenheit). A sua descoberta desencadeou uma avalanche de pesquisas em todo o mundo sobre materiais relacionados que renderam dezenas de novos super-condutores, chegando a uma temperatura de transição de 135 Kelvin. Hoje, ele desenvolve compostos de óxidos complexos com novas estruturas de cristal para possíveis usos em micro-electrónica.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou foi tornada publica mais uma falha de segurança que afecta quase todos os processadores da Intel desde 2011. "ZombieLoad", como é chamado, é um ataque de canal lateral possível nos chips da Intel, permitindo que os hackers explorem efectivamente falhas de desenho em vez de injectar código malicioso. A Intel informou que o ZombieLoad é composto de quatro bugs, que os investigadores reportaram ao fabricante de chips há apenas um mês. Quase todos os computadores com chips da Intel datados de 2011 são afectados pelas vulnerabilidades.</p>

<p>Também esta semana ficámos a saber que o MRO da NASA concluiu 60.000 viagens em torno de Marte. O Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter da NASA entrou em órbita a 10 de Março de 2006, e tem recolhido informação diária sobre a superfície e a atmosfera do planeta, incluindo visualizações detalhadas com sua câmara de experiências científicas de imagens de alta resolução (HiRISE). O HiRISE é poderoso o suficiente para ver características da superfície do tamanho de uma mesa de jantar a cerca de 480 quilómetros acima da superfície.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como um modelo 3D que poderá ser útil. É apresentada a revista newelectronics de 14 de Maio, um livro sobre Kotlin e outro livro sobre Python.</p>

<h2><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/14/zombieload-flaw-intel-processors/">New secret-spilling flaw affects almost every Intel chip since 2011</a></h2>

<p><em>"Security researchers have found a new class of vulnerabilities in Intel chips which, if exploited, can be used to steal sensitive information directly from the processor., The bugs are reminiscent of Meltdown and Spectre, which exploited a weakness in speculative execution, an important part of how modern processors work. Speculative execution helps processors predict to a certain degree what an application or operating system might need next and in the near-future, making the app run faster and more efficient. The processor will execute its predictions if they’re needed, or discard them if they’re not. Both Meltdown and Spectre leaked sensitive data stored briefly in the processor, including secrets — such as passwords, secret keys and account tokens, and private messages. Now some of the same researchers are back with an entirely new round of data-leaking bugs. “ZombieLoad,” as it’s called, is a side-channel attack targeting Intel chips, allowing hackers to effectively exploit design flaws rather than injecting malicious code."</em> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/14/zombieload-flaw-intel-processors/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7401">NASA's MRO Completes 60,000 Trips Around Mars</a></h2>

<p><em>"NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter hit a dizzying milestone this morning: It completed 60,000 loops around the Red Planet at 10:39 a.m. PDT (1:39 p.m. EDT). On average, MRO takes 112 minutes to circle Mars, whipping around at about 2 miles per second (3.4 kilometers per second). Since entering orbit on March 10, 2006, the spacecraft has been collecting daily science about the planet's surface and atmosphere, including detailed views with its High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment camera (HiRISE). HiRISE is powerful enough to see surface features the size of a dining room table from 186 miles (300 kilometers) above the surface. Meanwhile, MRO is watching the daily weather and probing the subsurface for ice, providing data that can influence the designs of future missions that will take humans to Mars. But MRO isn't just sending back its own science; it serves in a network of relays that beam data back to Earth from NASA's Mars rovers and landers."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7401">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Lilium, the Munich-based startup developing a revolutionary on- demand air taxi service, today revealed its new five-seater air taxi prototype for the first time. The unveiling of the new Lilium Jet came as the all-electric aircraft completed its maiden flight in the skies over Germany earlier this month. The full-scale, full-weight prototype is powered by 36 all-electric jet engines that allow it to take-off and land vertically, while achieving remarkably efficient horizontal, or cruise, flight. The simplicity of the aircraft design, with no tail, no rudder, no propellers, no gearbox and only one moving part in the engine not only contributes to the safety and affordability of the aircraft, but it has also allowed the design team to focus their efforts on creating a magical customer experience in the cabin, from panoramic windows to gull-wing doors. Celebrating the landmark, Daniel Wiegand, co-founder and CEO, said: “Today we are taking another huge step towards making urban air mobility a reality. In less than two years we have been able to design, build and successfully fly an aircraft that will serve as our template for mass production."</em> <a href="https://lilium.com/newsroom-detail/lilium-reveals-new-air-taxi-as-it-celebrates-maiden-flight">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Weyl semimetals are a recently discovered class of materials, in which charge carriers behave the way electrons and positrons do in particle accelerators. Researchers from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology and Ioffe Institute in St. Petersburg have shown that these materials represent perfect gain media for lasers. The research findings were published in Physical Review B. The 21st-century physics is marked by the search for phenomena from the world of fundamental particles in tabletop materials.

<h2><a href="http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2019/04/new-way-see-objects-accelerates-future-self-driving-cars">New way to 'see' objects accelerates future of self-driving cars</a></h2>

<p><em>"The laser sensors currently used to detect 3D objects in the paths of autonomous cars are bulky, ugly, expensive, energy-inefficient – and highly accurate. These Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors are affixed to cars’ roofs, where they increase wind drag, a particular disadvantage for electric cars. They can add around $10,000 to a car’s cost. But despite their drawbacks, most experts have considered LiDAR sensors the only plausible way for self-driving vehicles to safely perceive pedestrians, cars and other hazards on the road. Now, Cornell researchers have discovered that a simpler method, using two inexpensive cameras on either side of the windshield, can detect objects with nearly LiDAR’s accuracy and at a fraction of the cost. The researchers found that analyzing the captured images from a bird’s-eye view rather than the more traditional frontal view more than tripled their accuracy, making stereo camera a viable and low-cost alternative to LiDAR."</em> <a href="http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2019/04/new-way-see-objects-accelerates-future-self-driving-cars">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers at the University of East Anglia have helped discover how bacteria turn methane gas into a useable fuel - liquid methanol. Methanotrophic bacteria (or ‘methanotrophs’) oxidize methane and convert it to methanol. In doing so, not only are they removing a dangerous greenhouse gas from the environment, but creating a sustainable fuel for cars, electricity and more. But exactly how these bacteria naturally perform such a complex reaction has been a mystery. Now, a study published in Science, provides a major leap forward in understanding how bacteria methane-to-methanol conversion happens. Research led by Northwestern University (US) in collaboration with UEA found that the enzyme responsible for the methane-methanol conversion catalyses this reaction at a site that contains just one copper ion."</em> <a href="https://www.uea.ac.uk/about/-/methane-consuming-bacteria-could-be-the-future-of-fuel">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.pppl.gov/news/2019/04/artificial-intelligence-accelerates-efforts-develop-clean-virtually-limitless-fusion">Artificial intelligence accelerates efforts to develop clean, virtually limitless fusion energy</a></h2>

<p><em>"Artificial intelligence (AI), a branch of computer science that is transforming scientific inquiry and industry, could now speed the development of safe, clean and virtually limitless fusion energy for generating electricity. A major step in this direction is under way at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) and Princeton University, where a team of scientists working with a Harvard graduate student is for the first time applying deep learning — a powerful new version of the machine learning form of AI — to forecast sudden disruptions that can halt fusion reactions and damage the doughnut-shaped tokamaks that house the reactions. Promising new chapter in fusion research “This research opens a promising new chapter in the effort to bring unlimited energy to Earth,” Steve Cowley, director of PPPL, said of the findings (link is external), which are reported in the current issue of Nature magazine. “Artificial intelligence is exploding across the sciences and now it’s beginning to contribute to the worldwide quest for fusion power.” Fusion, which drives the sun and stars, is the fusing of light elements in the form of plasma — the hot, charged state of matter composed of free electrons and atomic nuclei — that generates energy. Scientists are seeking to replicate fusion on Earth for an abundant supply of power for the production of electricity. Crucial to demonstrating the ability of deep learning to forecast disruptions — the sudden loss of confinement of plasma particles and energy — has been access to huge databases provided by two major fusion facilities: the DIII-D National Fusion Facility that General Atomics operates for the DOE in California, the largest facility in the United States, and the Joint European Torus (JET) in the United Kingdom, the largest facility in the world, which is managed by EUROfusion, the European Consortium for the Development of Fusion Energy."</em> <a href="https://www.pppl.gov/news/2019/04/artificial-intelligence-accelerates-efforts-develop-clean-virtually-limitless-fusion">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/news/news-overview/just-like-toothpaste-fluoride-radically-improves-the-stability-of-perovskite-solar-cells/">Just like toothpaste: fluoride radically improves the stability of perovskite solar cells</a></h2>

<p><em>"Researchers from the TU/e have discovered that adding a small amount of fluoride to perovskite solar cells significantly increases their stability. Solar cells made of perovskite hold much promise for the future of solar energy. The material is cheap, easy to produce and almost as efficient as silicon, the material traditionally used in solar cells.

<p><em>"A team of computer scientists, physicists, and software engineers optimized software for Intel's high-speed communication network to accelerate application codes for particle physics and machine learning. High-performance computing (HPC)—the use of supercomputers and parallel processing techniques to solve large computational problems—is of great use in the scientific community. For example, scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Brookhaven National Laboratory rely on HPC to analyze the data they collect at the large-scale experimental facilities on site and to model complex processes that would be too expensive or impossible to demonstrate experimentally. Modern science applications, such as simulating particle interactions, often require a combination of aggregated computing power, high-speed networks for data transfer, large amounts of memory, and high-capacity storage capabilities. Advances in HPC hardware and software are needed to meet these requirements. Computer and computational scientists and mathematicians in Brookhaven Lab’s Computational Science Initiative (CSI) are collaborating with physicists, biologists, and other domain scientists to understand their data analysis needs and provide solutions to accelerate the scientific discovery process."</em> <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=212917">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers at the University of Maryland (UMD) and US Army Research Lab (ARL) have taken a critical step on the path to high energy batteries by improving their water-in-salt battery with a new type of chemical transformation of the cathode that creates a reversible solid salt layer, a phenomenon yet unknown in the field of water-based batteries. Building on their previous discoveries of the water-in-salt electrolytes reported in Science in 2015, the researchers added a new cathode. This new cathode material, lacking transition metal, operates at an average potential of 4.2 volts with excellent cycling stability, and delivers an unprecedented energy density comparable, or perhaps higher than, non-aqueous Li-ion batteries.

<p><em>"NYU Researchers discover new method of controlling magnetic circuits using energy efficient switch that does not require electric currents Logic and memory devices, such as the hard drives in computers, now use nanomagnetic mechanisms to store and manipulate information. Unlike silicon transistors, which have fundamental efficiency limitations, they require no energy to maintain their magnetic state: Energy is needed only for reading and writing information. One method of controlling magnetism uses electrical current that transports spin to write information, but this usually involves flowing charge. Because this generates heat and energy loss, the costs can be enormous, particularly in the case of large server farms or in applications like artificial intelligence, which require massive amounts of memory. Spin, however, can be transported without a charge with the use of a topological insulator – a material whose interior is insulating but that can support the flow of electrons on its surface. In a newly published Physical Review Applied paper, researchers from New York University introduce a voltage-controlled topological spin switch (vTOPSS) that requires only electric fields, rather than currents, to switch between two Boolean logic states, greatly reducing the heat generated and energy used."</em> <a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/news/move-over-silicon-switches-theres-new-way-compute">[...]</a>

The research team, from the University of Bath, Fudan University, Shanghai, and the Shanghai Institute of Pollution Control and Ecological Security, hopes the catalyst design will eventually allow the use of renewable electricity to convert CO₂ into fuels without creating additional atmospheric carbon – essentially acting like an electrochemical ‘leaf’ to convert carbon dioxide into sugars. Using this reaction, known as the reduction of carbon dioxide, has exciting potential but two major obstacles are poor conversion efficiency of the reaction and a lack of detailed knowledge about the exact reaction pathway.

For the first time ever, researchers have measured the fidelity – that is, the accuracy – of two-qubit logic operations in silicon, with highly promising results that will enable scaling up to a full-scale quantum processor. The research, carried out by Professor Andrew Dzurak’s team in UNSW Engineering, was published today in the world-renowned journal Nature.

<p><em>"I build my first CNC about a year ago and learned a lot from the process. As an engineer I'm always looking at ways to improve things, and my first machine was no exception. The process began with some small changes which quickly turned into the opportunity to overhaul the design even more to better suit my needs (an overview of these changes is detailed in the next step). For the previous iteration and documentation of my design, refer to my original Instructable: Modular DIY CNC Machine which has all the files included for easy access. For this Instructable, however, I've decided to include technical drawings of the plates rather than actual part files. The parts themselves are fairly easy to create so this shouldn't be a large inconvenience for most, especially if you plan on actually using a CNC since CAD is a big step in the whole CNC proces."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Modular-DIY-CNC-V2/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Live music gigs are always a very special thing, but to produce it, you need humans, and humans are not always available. I occasionally play gigs equipped by my guitar and my voice, but music generally features many others instruments, like percussion, and these instruments tend to only sound when played by humans. This problem could be solved by just using a recording and playing over it, but that would somehow feel against the idea of the live concept. So, I decided to get rid of the human element entirely, and build a robot drummer... The idea would be to make something portable, which could move and play sounds in different rhythms with no use of samples/recordings, that could be played or stopped at will, and that its sound could be amplified in a gig/band situation.
