<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1820, Édouard Roche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89douard_Roche). Este astrónomo matemático francês estudou a estrutura interna dos corpos celestes e foi o primeiro a propor um modelo da Terra com um núcleo sólido. Ele determinou em 1850 o limite de Roche para um satélite ter uma órbita estável em torno de um planeta de densidade igual. O corpo menor não podia ficar a 2,44 raios do corpo maior sem se separar do efeito da força gravitacional entre eles. Mais tarde, ele fez uma análise matemática rigorosa da hipótese nebular de Pierre Laplace e mostrou em 1873 a instabilidade de um corpo em forma de lente em rotação rápida.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1888, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bernays">Paul Bernays</a>. Este matemático e lógico suíço, ficou conhecido pelas suas tentativas de desenvolver uma teoria unificada da matemática. Bernays, influenciado pelo pensamento de Hilbert, acreditava que toda a estrutura da matemática poderia ser unificada como uma única entidade coerente. Para iniciar esse processo, foi necessário elaborar um conjunto de axiomas nos quais uma teoria completa pudesse se basear. Ele tentou colocar a teoria dos conjuntos numa base axiomática para evitar os paradoxos. Entre 1937 e 1954, Bernays escreveu uma série de artigos no Journal of Symbolic Logic que tentaram alcançar esse objectivo. Em 1958, Bernays publicou a teoria axiomática dos conjuntos, na qual ele combinou seu trabalho sobre a axiomatização da teoria dos conjuntos.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou a Canonical anunciou mais uma versão do Ubuntu - o 19.10. Esta versão teve um foco especial na produtividade do programador em AI / ML, novos recursos avançados para o MicroK8s (Kubernetes) e fornecer o mais rápido desempenho do desktop GNOME. Um dos hardwares suportados é o O Raspberry Pi 4 Modelo B. Com o GNOME 3.34, o Ubuntu 19.10 é a release mais rápida, com melhorias significativas no desempenho, proporcionando uma experiência mais ágil e responsiva, mesmo em hardware mais antigo. A organização das aplicações é mais fácil com a capacidade de arrastar e soltar ícones em pastas categorizadas, enquanto os utilizadores podem seleccionar variantes claras ou escuras do tema Yaru, dependendo das suas preferências ou para melhorar a acessibilidade da visualização.</p>

<p>Também esta semana o Chang'e 4 da China completa 10 dias lunares no lado mais afastado da Lua. Tanto o Chang'e 4 como o rover Yutu 2 entraram num estado de adormecimento em 5 de Outubro, em preparação para sobreviver a uma décima noite lunar. Durante a noite lunar de duas semanas, as temperaturas podem descer para menos de 310 graus Fahrenheit negativos (190 graus Celsius negativos), ameaçando os componentes da sonda.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. São também apresentados dois modelos 3D.</p>

<p><em>"On mission day 10, Yutu 2 covered its shortest distance yet, but the rover seems to be performing well. China's Chang'e 4 mission has completed 10 lunar days of activity on the far side of the moon, returning new images and carrying out science tasks. Both the Chang'e 4 lander and the Yutu 2 rover entered a dormant state on Oct. 5 in preparation to survive a 10th lunar night. During the roughly two-week-long lunar night, temperatures can drop to as low as minus 310 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 190 degrees Celsius), threatening the spacecraft's health every time. The rover and the lander began lunar day 10 on Sept. 22 and 23, respectively, according to the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program. Yutu 2 drove just 16.7 feet (5.1 meters) on day 10 — the shortest distance it has covered during a single day."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/china-change-4-moon-far-side-mission-10-days.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"We still have a couple of weeks until the holiday season, but here’s an early gift for you: I’m excited to announce our brand new Original Prusa MINI, a smart and compact 3D printing workhorse with all the bells and whistles you’re accustomed to when you buy an Original Prusa 3D printer. While we know that many of you have been calling for a larger printer, we think the MINI might surprise you and this article may have some additional treats at the end! The MINI has a print volume of 18×18×18 cm (7×7×7 inches), removable spring steel bed sheets, networking with ethernet and optional Wi-Fi and it’s all controlled by our brand new custom-made 32-bit Buddy mainboard with silent 2209 Trinamic drivers. The icing on the cake, we managed to do this (and more) for 349 USD / 379 EUR (VAT incl.)! A bit of a backstory: During the last 10 years of making 3D printers, I have come to realize there will never be a single universal “almighty” machine. I like the idea of what’s currently happening in the field of computer processors, especially ARM with their big.LITTLE architecture."</em> <a href="https://blog.prusaprinters.org/original-prusa-mini-is-here-smart-and-compact-3d-printer/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"After successfully launching Thursday night, NASA’s Ionospheric Connection Explorer (ICON) spacecraft is in orbit for a first-of-its-kind mission to study a region of space where changes can disrupt communications and satellite orbits, and even increase radiation risks to astronauts. A Northrop Grumman Stargazer L-1011 aircraft took off at 8:31 p.m. EDT from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida carrying ICON, on a Northrop Grumman Pegasus XL rocket, to launch altitude of about 39,000 feet. The first launch opportunity around 9:30 was skipped due to communication issues between the ground team at Cape Canaveral and the aircraft. On the second attempt, the aircraft crew released its payload at 9:59 p.m. EDT and automated systems on the Pegasus rocket launched ICON, a spacecraft roughly the size of a refrigerator, into space. The spacecraft’s solar panels successfully deployed, indicating it has power with all systems operating. After an approximately month-long commissioning period, ICON will begin sending back its first science data in November."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-spacecraft-launches-on-mission-to-explore-frontier-of-space">[...]</a>

<p><em>"For every action, there is a reaction: that is the principle on which all space rockets operate, blasting propellant in one direction to travel in the other. But one NASA engineer believes he could take us to the stars without any propellant at all. Designed by David Burns at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama, the “helical engine” exploits mass-altering effects known to occur at near-light speed. Burns has posted a paper describing the concept to NASA’s technical reports server. It has been met with scepticism from some quarters, but Burns believes his concept is worth pursuing. “I’m comfortable with throwing it out there,” he says."</em> <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2218685-nasa-engineers-helical-engine-may-violate-the-laws-of-physics/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"UPS (NYSE:UPS) subsidiary UPS Flight Forward Inc. today announced it has received the U.S. government’s first full Part 135 Standard certification to operate a drone airline. The company will initially expand its drone delivery service further to support hospital campuses around the country, and to provide solutions for customers beyond those in the healthcare industry. UPS Flight Forward plans in the future to transport a variety of items for customers in many industries, and regularly fly drones beyond the operators’ visual line of sight. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) awarded UPS Flight Forward a Part 135 Standard certification on Friday. The UPS subsidiary immediately launched the first drone delivery flight by any company under Part 135 Standard at WakeMed’s hospital campus in Raleigh, N.C. That flight, using a Matternet M2 quadcopter, was flown under a government exemption allowing for a “beyond visual line of sight” (BVLOS) operation, also a first in the U.S. for a regular revenue-generating delivery. UPS has proven the need for drone delivery in healthcare operations, where the shortest time in transit can improve efficiency and help healthcare professionals serve their patients better."</em> <a href="https://pressroom.ups.com/pressroom/ContentDetailsViewer.page?ConceptType=PressReleases&amp;id=1569933965476-404">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers from The University of Manchester, with colleagues from the universities of Groningen and Utrecht in the Netherlands, say 3D curved microchip structures could be used to develop more powerful – and energy efficient – spin-based computers. The work, published online in the journal Nano Letters, outlines the main challenges involved in creating 3D curved microchips that rely on the “spin” of electrons to carry and store information. According to Dr Ivan Vera-Marun, a lead researcher on the study, the key issue is that spin-based microchips are usually 2D structures. Therefore, a fundamental challenge when building 3D structures is transporting electrons without losing their unique spin properties. Collectively, the use of electron spin in electronics is known as “spintronics”. To investigate this, the researchers used ion beams – a form of molecular sandblasting – to carve trenches in a piece of silicon, the material which forms the basis of microchips."</em> <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/3d-microchips-could-pave-way-to-more-efficient-spintronic-computers/">[...]</a>

Being able to simulate how a molecule unfolds or how it reacts with another one to produce a larger molecular compound is an extremely complex task. So far, classical computers or even supercomputers have not been able to model the many-body interactions that occur within such compounds, simply because they do not have the capacity to process this information in a reasonable amount of time. As a solution, quantum simulators have become an alternative approach to tackle quantum problems that overpass our computational capabilities. In particular, they have been used in the field of condensed matter physics and to imitate crystals but, until now, it remained unknown how to simulate the interactions between electrons accurately enough within complex molecular systems.

This chip contains three independent square-wave oscillators (great for generating chords), a noise generator, an envelope generator and a mixer. All these functions are fully controllable, but it does comes with a few limitations; the design I am presenting here is meant as an extension to, for example, drum machines/samplers capable of sending MIDI (trigger) notes. This design, called TB-AY-3 (or Techno Box AY-3-8910) sounds best with the release-only type of envelope (i.e. to generate percussion type of sounds), but it does allow you to select other types.I pre-programmed 8 patches:The first 5 you can freely edit (Bass drum, Snare drum, Closed hi-hat, Open hi-hat and a bleep sound) The remaining 3 patches are hard coded (a random bleep sound, an arcade kind of video game sound and a Kraftwerk "pocket calculator" kind of random melody) You can't save the changes you make to the 5 selectable patches; the intention here is to tweak the sounds on the fly (as they are MIDI-triggered) - often resulting in cool techno patterns.Important to understand here is that the design is monophonic (only one patch at a time).

<p><em>"When I buy a new servo motor, I want to quickly check if it is working. The Two-Mode Servo Tester lets me do that in a minute. Servos, at least the cheaper ones I know, sometimes do not work as expected when they arrive: The gears jump, the electronic in the servo does not work or it is a 120 degree and not a 180 degree servo. It is a good thing to test a servo. Until now, I used to grab a breadboard, an Arduino, a 5V power supply, a USB cable, my PC and some jumper cables and built a servo tester every time from scratch. The Two-Mode Servo Tester is all that and more in a case."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Two-Mode-Servo-Tester/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"I’ve been meaning to get round to doing a Arduboy but never got round to it. I’m quite glad I waited because there seams to be a resurgence in the platform as of late. Also they have added the ability to add a flash cart to your build. What makes all this so easy is its all open source with lots of documentation. Join me below to see how my build panned out… Hardware - Arduino pro micro - SSD1306 0.96” SPI Serial 128X64 OLED LCD - Soft touch buttons x6 - SMD reboot button x1 - SMD slide switch x2 - SMD Piezo speaker x1 - W25Q128 128Mb - TXB0104 Voltage Level Shift Arduboy build I’ll start with the Arduboy its self.
