<p>Faz hoje anos  que nascia, em 1692, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieter_van_Musschenbroek">Pieter van Musschenbroek</a>. Este Físico e matemático holandês inventou o frasco de Leyden, o primeiro dispositivo eficaz para armazenar electricidade estática. Ele cresceu numa família que fabricava instrumentos científicos como telescópios, microscópios e bombas de ar. Antes da invenção de Musschenbroek, a electricidade estática tinha sido produzida por Guericke usando uma bola de enxofre, com efeitos reduzidos. Em Janeiro de 1746, Musschenbroek colocou água num recipiente de metal suspenso em cordões de seda e conduziu um fio de latão através de uma rolha para dentro da água. Ele acumulou uma carga na água. Quando um assistente incauto tocou o recipiente de metal e o fio de latão, a descarga deste aparelho produziu um choque substancial de electricidade estática. O nome de Leyden está ligado à descoberta feita na Universidade de Leiden.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1800, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bogardus">James Bogardus</a>. Este inventor e construtor norte-americano popularizou a construção em ferro fundido, que era comummente usada na construção industrial e comercial americana de 1850-80. Ele fez isso enviando secções pré-fabricadas da sua fábrica em Nova York para os locais de construção. O seu primeiro prédio com fachada de ferro era uma loja de químicos de 5 andares (1848). O seu prédio mais conhecido era sua própria fábrica de quatro andares que ele construiu na Center Street, em Nova York, com um exterior consistindo inteiramente de pilares e vigas de ferro fundido. Anteriormente, ele era um fabricante de máquinas de esmerilamento e também era conhecido pela sua invenção de máquinas de gravação e de tingir.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1879, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>. Este Físico germano-americano desenvolveu as teorias gerais e especiais da relatividade e ganhou o Prémio Nobel de Física em 1921 pela sua explicação do efeito fotoeléctrico. Reconhecido em seu próprio tempo como um dos intelectos mais criativos da história humana, nos primeiros 15 anos do século XX, Einstein desenvolveu uma série de teorias que propunham maneiras inteiramente novas de pensar sobre espaço, tempo e gravitação. As suas teorias de relatividade e gravitação foram um avanço profundo sobre a antiga física Newtoniana e revolucionaram a investigação científica e filosófica.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1956, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexey_Pajitnov">Alexey Pajitnov</a>. É um engenheiro de computação russo que ficou conhecido na história por ter desenvolvido o Tetris enquanto trabalhava no Centro de Computação Dorodnitsyn da Academia Soviética de Ciências.</p>

<p>Hoje é o dia do Pi (3.14) e para comemorar esse dia a Google publicou uma noticia onde uma equipa bateu o recorde de calculo do famoso numero com maior precisão até agora registada. Quer se perceba ou não, o PI está em toda parte. É a relação entre a circunferência de um círculo e seu diâmetro. E já que o PI é um número irracional, não há fim para quantos dos seus dígitos podem ser calculados. É conhecido como 3,14, mas os profissionais de matemática e ciências estão constantemente a trabalhar para calcular mais e mais dígitos do PI, para que possam testar supercomputadores (e também ter um pouco de competição saudável). Para calcular o PI, Emma Haruka Iwao usou um aplicativo chamado y-cruncher em 25 máquinas virtuais do Google Cloud. “O maior desafio do PI é que requer muito armazenamento e memória para calcular”, diz Emma. O seu cálculo exigiu 170 terabytes de dados para serem concluídos - o que equivale aproximadamente à quantidade de dados em todas as colecções de impressão da Biblioteca do Congresso. O numero agora calculado tem 31.415.926.535.897 dígitos, para ser exacto. Este recorde agora batido existia deste 2016 quando foram calculados 22.459.157.718.361 dígitos.</p>

<p>Como é o dia do PI, fica aqui um <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Pi-Day-Pie-Recipes/">link</a> para receitas de Tartes! Para os mais excêntricos podem também ouvir uma <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vbwn7d/musician-creates-a-million-hour-song-based-on-the-number-pi">musica baseada no numero PI</a> composta por um musico e que tem 1 milhão de horas.</p>

<p>Esta semana que passou também ficámos a saber que a World Wide Web fez 30 anos. Em 1989, o maior laboratório de física do mundo, o CERN, tinha um grupo de ideias e informações armazenadas em vários computadores incompatíveis. Sir Tim Berners-Lee imaginou uma estrutura unificadora para ligar informações em diferentes computadores e escreveu uma proposta em março de 1989 chamada "Information Management: A Proposal". Em 1991, essa visão de conectividade universal tinha-se tornado a World Wide Web.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como alguns modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis. É apresentada a revista Hispabrick nº 32.</p>

<p><em>"Today, March 14, is Pi Day (3.14). Here at Google, we’re celebrating the day with a new milestone: A team at Google has broken the Guinness World Records title for most accurate value of pi. Whether or not you realize it, pi is everywhere you look. It’s the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, so the next time you check your watch or see the turning wheels of a vehicle go by, you’re looking at pi. And since pi is an irrational number, there’s no end to how many of its digits can be calculated. You might know it as 3.14, but math and science pros are constantly working to calculate more and more digits of pi, so they can test supercomputers (and have a bit of healthy competition, too)."</em> <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/google-cloud/most-calculated-digits-pi/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/27059582.html">JAXA and Toyota Reach Agreement on Consideration Toward International Space Exploration</a></h2>

<p><em>"Aiming to make future lunar mobility a reality The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota) announce their agreement today to consider the possibility of collaborating on international space exploration. As a first step, JAXA and Toyota have reached agreement to further cooperate on and accelerate their ongoing joint study*1 of a manned, pressurized rover*2 that employs fuel cell electric vehicle technologies. Such a form of mobility is deemed necessary for human exploration activities on the lunar surface. Even with the limited amount of energy that can be transported to the moon, the pressurized rover would have a total lunar-surface cruising range of more than 10,000 km. International space exploration, aiming to achieve sustainable prosperity for all of humankind by expanding the domain of human activity and giving rise to intellectual properties, has its sights set on the moon and Mars. To achieve the goals of such exploration, coordination between robotic missions, such as the recent successful touchdown by the asteroid probe Hayabusa2 on the asteroid Ryugu, and human missions, such as those involving humans using pressurized rovers to conduct activities on the moon, is essential."</em> <a href="https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/27059582.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Compute Express Link Technology will Improve Performance and Remove Bottlenecks in Computation-Intensive Workloads As part of my job leading the data-centric groups at Intel, I regularly meet with customers from across many different industries. They all face unique business challenges, but they have one thing in common: the need to get more value out of enormous amounts of data. To address this, Intel together with Alibaba*, Cisco*, Dell EMC*, Facebook*, Google*, Hewlett Packard Enterprise*, Huawei* and Microsoft* today announced the founding of a consortium to develop Compute Express Link (CXL), an open interconnect technology that improves performance and removes the bottlenecks in computation-intensive workloads for CPUs and purpose-built accelerators. Intel developed the technology behind CXL and donated it to the consortium to become the initial release of the new specification. I am proud of the work Intel has done in developing this interconnect technology and the milestone it represents to the technology industry – much like our roles with Universal Serial Bus (USB) and PCI Express – and we look forward to working with the CXL consortium on future versions of the specification. Why CXL is Important The explosion of data and rapid innovation in specialized workloads – like compression, encryption and artificial intelligence (AI) – have given rise to heterogeneous computing, where purpose-built accelerators work side-by-side with general-purpose CPUs."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/milestone-moving-data/">[...]</a>

These cameras are capable of taking high resolution images from a distance of up to six nautical miles (about 11 kilometers) during day or night. The photodetectors in these cameras remain susceptible to thermal noise, however, and since the equipment required for cooling them is quite large, it became necessary to find a way to reduce the cameras to a practical size. With the development of a sensor semiconductor structure that reduces the impact of thermal noise, Fujitsu Laboratories has made it possible to create handheld-sized, high-sensitivity infrared cameras."</em> <a href="http://www.fujitsu.com/global/about/resources/news/press-releases/2019/0301-02.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A new study led by Berkeley Lab reveals how aligned layers of atomically thin semiconductors can yield an exotic new quantum material A team of researchers led by the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) has developed a simple method that could turn ordinary semiconducting materials into quantum machines – superthin devices marked by extraordinary electronic behavior. Such an advancement could help to revolutionize a number of industries aiming for energy-efficient electronic systems – and provide a platform for exotic new physics. The study describing the method, which stacks together 2D layers of tungsten disulfide and tungsten diselenide to create an intricately patterned material, or superlattice, was published online recently in the journal Nature. “This is an amazing discovery because we didn’t think of these semiconducting materials as strongly interacting,” said Feng Wang, a condensed matter physicist with Berkeley Lab’s Materials Sciences Division and professor of physics at UC Berkeley. “Now this work has brought these seemingly ordinary semiconductors into the quantum materials space.” Two-dimensional (2D) materials, which are just one atom thick, are like nanosized building blocks that can be stacked arbitrarily to form tiny devices. When the lattices of two 2D materials are similar and well-aligned, a repeating pattern called a moiré superlattice can form."</em> <a href="https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2019/03/07/semiconductors-go-quantum/">[...]</a>

A transistor is a device that can be used in two basic operations, as an electronic switch or as an amplifier. Depending on the current we apply to it’s base, it can control a much larger current through the collector and emitter path with a typical multiplication of around 200 times. This is called the transistor gain. By connecting the output of one transistor to the base of another, we can multiply this gain to now get an amplification of 40 000 times. By building a circuit with three such stages we can create a device that is capable of detecting even the tiniest charges and movement of electricity."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Non-Contact-Voltage-Detector-2/">[...]</a>

The only tip I can give you would be to use a short usb cable to save from the space, glue the thermal pinter and the buttons, after you put everything together glue the swicth button to the hole as well.

<p><em>"Motto: If All The Bees In The World Die, Humans Will Not Survive My goal was to address the remote monitoring of a beehive (nevertheless the solution could be used for any kind of remote monitoring and data logging). Beehive monitoring is quite unique as there are certain limitations which must be taken into account as beehives are usually located in nature which means that: There is no electricity source - the power consumption matters There is no connectivity and even GSM signal is often not available Beehives are a subject of robbery (eighter because of the honey inside or because of the bees and beehive itself) This is why I decided to use the combination of Sony Spresense board and Sigfox network as the reliable data carrier to build a solution which fulfills all the basic requirements on remote beehive monitoring. So how does it look like? The prototype consists of the Sony Spresense board responsible for all the computing and detailed data logging to SD card, BME280 sensor responsible for temperature, humidity and atmospherical pressure measuring, GY MAX4466 microphone module with amplifier responsible for noise level monitoring and finally Sigfox modem responsible for the data transfer. Beehive monitoring with theft prevention (GPS) Sensors are recursively requested to provide the data and the result is stored to SD card each one minute. Each 15 minutes is the data sent over Sigfox too."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/vilemkuzel/beehive-monitoring-with-theft-prevention-gps-2842fa">[...]</a>

I build this 8x8 LED Matrix Module CLOCK developed by Adrian Jones.Time is displayed by scrolling from left to right, or, under software control, from top to bottom. Each digit of the time successively slides in from the right side and when centered, stops momentarily and brightens slightly. It then scrolls to the left while the next digit in the display scrolls into view. The cycle repeats with a short delay between successive displays.For "from top to bottom" vertical flipping you should change : static boolean top2bottom = false; to: static boolean top2bottom = true; As you can see in the comments of the code, many parameters can be changed, for example scroll spreed, number of blank lines between characters, 12/24 hour display, ms between characters, brightness etc.. Time can be easily set using a rotary encoder.A two-color diode displays the setting mode (minutes, hours or normal).I put the clock in a box made up of two basic pieces so the access to the inside of the box is very convenient and practical.

The result is a MIDI controller with a large amount of control removed - it plays a random musical note every time a radioactive decay is detected. The idea of using radioactive decay to generate random numbers is not especially novel. Geiger-Müller tubes have been used to provide random numbers for many years in hardware random number generators.

<p><em>"Some time ago I bought three different RFID modules for experimenting. In a previous project I detailed how to use a simple 125-kHz module to do a basic security function. Modules like that use read-only tags so the process is scan for the ID, store if desired, and compare against stored IDs. The other modules I bought operate at 13.56-MHz and use tags that can be both read and written so its kind of a waste to simply use them for basic security. The two common modules use either the RC522 chip or the PN532 chip both made by NXP. If youve read any of my other projects you know that I like to use cheap PIC microcontrollers and program in assembly language."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/RC522-and-PN532-RFID-Basics/">[...]</a>

Some possible applications include a cooking thermometer, a soldering-iron temperature monitor, or a wood burning stove temperature display. Introduction I've recently wanted to build a circuit capable of measuring temperatures around 250°C, and so the temperature sensors I’ve used in previous projects, such as the DS12B20, aren't suitable because they usually have an upper temperature limit of 150°C.

In this case we can implement the communication in Software. This approach is often called bit bang’ing and can be used to emulate all sorts of communication peripherals. Another use case might be, that in an existing project the pins tied to the hardware-UART are already in use, in which case we could also use a software-UART.
