<p>Esta é a Newsletter Nº200 e este numero para além de ser redondo tem vários significados. No domínio da Internet o código "200 OK" em <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#2xx_Success#2xx_Success">HTTP</a> significa que o pedido de um recurso web ocorreu com sucesso. Este número é igualmente considerado como a velocidade Standard das películas fotográficas - o ISO 200. Curiosamente a soma dos resultados da <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_totient_function">função totiente de Euler</a> aplicada aos primeiros vinte e cinco números inteiros é também 200. Contudo, a Newsletter Nº200 significa que esta Newsletter já é publicada à 200 semanas sem interrupção. Lançada a 5 de Maio de 2015 são quase 4 anos com a publicação semanal. Contou no seu historial com a publicação de mais de 4500 Noticias, mais de 6200 Projectos, perto de 500 EBooks e revistas, e quase 400 modelos 3D. Irei continuar a trabalhar para que continue a ser uma referencia para todos os que a consultam.</p>

<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1552, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jost_B%C3%BCrgi">Jost Bürgi</a>. Este Relojoeiro e matemático suíço inventou os logaritmos de forma independente do matemático escocês John Napier. Ele era o mais hábil e o mais famoso relojoeiro de seu tempo. Ele também fez instrumentos de geometria astronómicos e práticos (notavelmente a bússola proporcional e um instrumento de triangulação útil na pesquisa). Isto levou a que se tornasse assistente do astrónomo alemão Johannes Kepler. Bürgi foi um dos principais contribuidores para o desenvolvimento de fracções decimais e da notação exponencial, mas sua contribuição mais notável foi publicada em 1620 como uma tabela de anti-logaritmos. Napier publicou a sua tabela de logaritmos em 1614, mas Bürgi já tinha compilado a sua tabela de logaritmos pelo menos dez anos antes.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1814, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmond_Fr%C3%A9my">Edmond Frémy</a>. Este Químico francês é conhecido pela sua descoberta de fluoreto de hidrogénio e pelas investigações de compostos de flúor. Entre outros compostos, Frémy investigou os de ferro, estanho e chumbo. Ele também estudou o ácido osmico, o ozónio, as substâncias corantes das folhas e flores e a composição das substâncias animais. Aplicou química à saponificação comercial de gorduras e à tecnologia de ferro, aço, ácido sulfúrico, vidro e papel. Ele tentou, mas falhou, isolar o flúor. Ele também falhou em tentativas de fazer cristais de óxido de alumínio, mas descobriu que poderia criar rubis.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1901, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Pauling">Linus Pauling</a>. Este químico, físico e autor norte-americano aplicou a mecânica quântica ao estudo de estruturas moleculares, particularmente em conexão com ligações químicas. Pauling foi a única pessoa a ganhar dois prémios Nobel não partilhados. O primeiro foi o Prémio Nobel de Química concedido em 1954 por mapear os alicerces químicos da própria vida. Além disso, por causa de seu trabalho pela paz nuclear, ele recebeu o Prémio Nobel da Paz em 1962.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1916, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarfega">Audley Bowdler Williamson</a>. Este inventor e fabricante britânico de produtos de cuidados com a pele que inventou o limpador de mãos Swarfega, um gel verde que mecânicos, impressoras e outros usam para lavar graxa, sujidade e tinta das suas mãos. "AB", como era conhecido, fundou a sua empresa, Deb Ltd., em 1941, vendendo um detergente neutro para o tratamento das meias de seda, um mercado que entrou em colapso com a chegada do nylon após a Segunda Guerra Mundial. No entanto, ele sabia que os mecânicos limpavam as mãos com gasolina, parafina e areia, o que era eficaz na remoção de óleo, mas também causava pele seca e dermatite. Ele adaptou a sua fórmula de detergente para limpar o óleo da pele sem esses efeitos colaterais, e nomeou-o combinando "swarf" (termo para grão oleoso) e "-ega" (ansioso).</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1930, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Cooper">Leon Cooper</a>. Este Físico norte-americano recebeu (com John Bardeen e John Robert Schrieffer) o Prémio Nobel de Física em 1972, por contribuir com o conceito de pares de electrões de Cooper que formam a base da teoria de supercondutividade da BCS (suas iniciais), na qual ele trabalhou quando tinha cerca de 20 anos. Ele passou a tornar-se co-fundador e co-diretor da Nestor, Inc., um líder da indústria na aplicação de sistemas de redes neuronais para aplicações comerciais e militares. A empresa construiu sistemas de reconhecimento de padrões e avaliação de risco adaptáveis baseados em computador, com aplicações que classificam com precisão padrões complexos como alvos em sistemas de sonar, radar ou imagem. Ele também fundou e foi director do Instituto de Cérebro e Sistemas Neuronais da Brown University para desenvolver produtos farmacêuticos cognitivos e sistemas inteligentes para electrónica, automóveis e comunicações.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1939, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_C._Tsui">Daniel C. Tsui</a>. Este Físico sino-americano recebeu (com Horst L. Störmer e Robert B. Laughlin) o Prémio Nobel de Física de 1998 pela descoberta e explicação de que os electrões num campo magnético poderoso a temperaturas muito baixas podem formar um fluido quântico cujas partículas têm cargas eléctricas fraccionarias. Este efeito é conhecido como o quantum fraccionário.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1948, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Chu">Steven Chu</a>. Este Físico norte-americano que (com Claude Cohen-Tannoudji e William D. Phillips) recebeu o Prémio Nobel de Física de 1997 pela sua pesquisa independente e pioneira em arrefecimento e aprisionamento de átomos usando luz laser. No seu estado normal, o movimento térmico aleatório constante dos átomos limita as medições precisas dos estados atómicos. Assim, os físicos procuraram arrefecer e desacelerar os átomos o máximo possível. Chu usou seis feixes de laser e trabalhou com um gás quente de átomos de sódio. Ele conseguiu arrefecer e aprisionar átomos no que ele chamou de "melaço óptico". Em 1985, ele tinha arrefecido átomos de sódio a uma temperatura de cerca de 240 milionésimos de grau acima do zero absoluto. Os átomos podem ficar presos nos feixes de laser por um período de cerca de meio segundo.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1954, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Bourgain">Jean Bourgain</a>. Este Matemático belga recebeu a Medalha Fields em 1994 pelo seu trabalho em análise. As suas realizações em vários campos incluíram o problema de determinar o tamanho de uma secção de um espaço de Banach de dimensão finita n que se assemelha a um sub-espaço de Hilbert; uma prova da desigualdade de Luis Antonio Santaló; uma nova abordagem para alguns problemas na teoria ergódica; resulta em análise harmónica e operadores clássicos; e equações diferenciais parciais não lineares. O trabalho de Bourgain foi notável pela versatilidade que demonstrou ao aplicar ideias de disciplinas matemáticas abrangentes à solução de diversos problemas.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que investigadores conseguiram bater o recorde de capacidade de 26.2 terabits por segundo em mais de 6.000 km do cabo de fibra óptica transatlântica da MAREA. Uma equipa de investigadores da Infinera alcançou novos padrões de eficiência para cabos de fibra óptica transatlânticos. Testando uma abordagem emergente de como os sinais de luz são transmitidos - chamada modulação 16QAM - o grupo esmagou registos de eficiência para transferência de dados, quase duplicando a capacidade de dados e aproximando-se do limite teórico para tal transferência.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que a sonda israelita Beresheet que foi lançada com sucesso do foguetão Falcon 5 da SpaceX teve uma pequena falha no caminho para a lua. "Durante a fase de pré-manobra, o computador da sonda reiniciou-se inesperadamente, fazendo com que a manobra fosse automaticamente cancelada", disseram representantes da SpaceIL num comunicado. "As equipas de engenharia da SpaceIL e do IAI estão a examinar os dados e a analisar a situação. Neste momento, os sistemas da sonda estão a funcionar correctamente, excepto pelo problema conhecido no star tracker." Os seguidores de estrelas são usados pela sonda para a ajudar a orientar-se no espaço em relação às estrelas-alvo.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. É apresentado o livro "Conquer The Command Line" 2.a Edição e a revista MagPI Nº79.</p>

<p><em>"A new experiment has achieved a record fiber optic cable capacity of 26.2 terabits per second across more than 6,000 kilometers of the MAREA transatlantic fiber optic cable. If you are making an overseas phone call or using cloud computing, there is a 99 percent chance an undersea fiber optic cable is being utilized. Now, new work with lasers shows promise for squeezing more data through these cables, to help meet the growing demand for data flow between computers in North America and Europe. The method could increase network capacity without requiring new cables, which can cost hundreds of millions of dollars to build. A team of researchers from Infinera has achieved new benchmarks for efficiency for transatlantic fiber optic cables. Testing an emerging approach for how the light signals are transmitted -- called 16QAM modulation -- the group smashed through efficiency records for data transfer, nearly doubling data capacity and approaching the theoretical limit for such a transfer."</em> <a href="https://www.ofcconference.org/en-us/home/news-and-press/ofc-nfoec-press-releases/researchers-break-efficiency-record-for-data-trans/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The world's first private lunar lander has hit a snag en route to the moon. On Monday (Feb. 25), the Beresheet moon lander built by the Israeli startup SpaceIL missed a planned maneuver to steer the spacecraft along its eight-week journey to the lunar surface. The maneuver was originally scheduled for 5 p.m. EST (12 a.m. local time on Tuesday in Israel) as Beresheet orbited the Earth out of communications range with its mission control center. "During the pre-maneuver phase the spacecraft computer reset unexpectedly, causing the maneuver to be automatically cancelled," SpaceIL representatives said in a statement. "The engineering teams of SpaceIL and IAI are examining the data and analyzing the situation. At this time, the spacecraft's systems are working well, except for the known problem in the star tracker.""</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/israel-moon-lander-suffers-glitch.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Carbon-free technologies like renewable energy help combat climate change, but many of them have not reached their full potential. Consider wind power: over the past decade, wind farms have become an important source of carbon-free electricity as the cost of turbines has plummeted and adoption has surged. However, the variable nature of wind itself makes it an unpredictable energy sourceless useful than one that can reliably deliver power at a set time. In search of a solution to this problem, last year, DeepMind and Google started applying machine learning algorithms to 700 megawatts of wind power capacity in the central United States. These wind farmspart of Googles global fleet of renewable energy projectscollectively generate as much electricity as is needed by a medium-sized city. Using a neural network trained on widely available weather forecasts and historical turbine data, we configured the DeepMind system to predict wind power output 36 hours ahead of actual generation."</em> <a href="https://www.blog.google/technology/ai/machine-learning-can-boost-value-wind-energy/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Recent advances in battery technology, from the engineering of their cases to the electrochemistry that takes place inside them, has enabled the rapid rise of Teslas, Leafs, Volts and other electric cars. Now, scientists at Scripps Research, inspired by the refined electrochemistry of these batteries, have developed a battery-like system that allows them to make potential advancements for the manufacturing of medicines. Their new method, reported February 22 in Science, avoids safety risks associated with a type of chemical reaction known as dissolving metal reduction, which is often used to produce compounds used in the manufacturing of medicines. Their method would offer tremendous advantages over current methods of chemical manufacturing, but until now, has largely been sidelined due to safety considerations. “The same types of batteries we use in our electric cars today were far too dangerous for commercial use a few decades ago, but now they are remarkably safe thanks to advances in chemistry and engineering,” says Phil Baran, PhD, who holds the Darlene Shiley Chair in Chemistry at Scripps Research and is a senior author of the Science paper. “By applying some of the same principles that made this new generation of batteries possible, we have developed a method to safely conduct powerfully reductive chemical reactions that have very rarely been used on a large scale because — until now — they were too dangerous or costly.” “This could have a major impact on not only the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals,” Baran adds, “but also on the mindset of medicinal chemists who traditionally avoid such chemistry due to safety concerns."</em> <a href="https://www.scripps.edu/news-and-events/press-room/2019/20190221-baran-science.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A new theory could enable researchers and industry to tune and improve the performance of a material called ionic ceramics in rechargeable batteries, fuel cells and other energy applications. Ionic ceramics are made up of many faceted “grains” that meet at boundaries in ways that affect, for example, how much power a fuel cell can deliver or how fast a battery can be recharged and how long it can hold a charge. “My cell phone has a (fixed) amount of charge, and those grain boundaries are a limiting factor,” to how much of that charge is indeed useful said Edwin García, a professor of materials engineering at Purdue University. One challenge in perfecting technologies that use ionic ceramics is overcoming the insulating effects of the grain boundaries (interfaces between grains), which undergo “phase transitions” (structural and electrochemical changes), thus impacting material properties. “It’s a problem that has existed in the field of ceramics for the last 40 years,” he said. However, it was not until these last 10 years when scientists realized that interfaces (2D materials), just like bulk phases (3D materials) can undergo phase transitions."</em> <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2019/Q1/new-theory-could-lead-to-better-batteries,-fuel-cells.html">[...]</a>

The colder the better, because it makes the device more sensitive, more stable and less distorted, and therefore, more useful for practical applications. Until now, however, researchers have only been able to reduce a few types of vibrations.

These two states consist of electrons moving in elliptical orbits with different orientations. To the teams surprise, they found that the current flow in these channels can be turned on and off, making these channels a new type of controllable quantum wire. “These channels are remarkable because they spontaneously form at the boundaries between different quantum states in which electrons collectively align their elliptical orbits,” said Ali Yazdani, the Class of 1909 Professor of Physics and director of the Princeton Center for Complex Materials, who headed the research. “It is exciting to see how the interaction between electrons in the channels strongly dictates whether or not they can conduct.” The researchers used a scanning tunneling microscope a device capable of imaging individual atoms and mapping the motion of electrons on a materials surface to visualize electron behaviors on the surface of a crystal made of pure bismuth."</em> <a href="https://discovery.princeton.edu/2019/02/06/controllable-electron-flow-in-quantum-wires/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Many major advances in medicine, especially in neurology, have been sparked by recent advances in electronic systems that can acquire, process, and interact with biological substrates. These bioelectronic systems, which are increasingly used to understand dynamic living organisms and to treat human disease, require devices that can record body signals, process them, detect patterns, and deliver electrical or chemical stimulation to address problems. Transistors, the devices that amplify or switch electronic signals on circuits, form the backbone of these systems. However, they must meet numerous criteria to operate efficiently and safely in biological environments such as the human body. To date, researchers have not been able to build transistors that have all the features needed for safe, reliable, and fast operation in these environments over extended periods of time. A team led by Dion Khodagholy, assistant professor of electrical engineering at Columbia Engineering, and Jennifer N. Gelinas, Columbia University Medical Center, Department of Neurology, and the Institute for Genomic Medicine, has developed the first biocompatible ion-driven transistor that is fast enough to enable real-time signal sensing and stimulation of brain signals."</em> <a href="https://engineering.columbia.edu/press-releases/ionic-transistors-bioelectronic-devices">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In collaboration with industry, researchers from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have made the first portable prototype of the Fixed-Length Optical Cavity (FLOC), a device that uses light to measure pressure with higher accuracy and precision than most commercial pressure sensors. This newest version is a milestone on the journey toward the creation of a device that could revolutionize the way pressure is measured with potential uses by many industries, particularly semiconductor chip and aircraft manufacturing. In 2017, NIST and MKS Instruments, Inc. of Andover, Massachusetts, signed a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to take a laboratory-scale version of the FLOC and create a smaller, more robust prototype that more closely resembles a commercial product. Thanks to the CRADA work, the joint NIST and MKS team has now successfully demonstrated a prototype version small enough to fit into two suitcases, Hendricks said. MKS Instruments brings over 50 years of pressure measurement, optical and laser experience to this project, and we are honored to have been selected by NIST to work with them on this important and prestigious development, said Phil Sullivan, CTO of MKSs Pressure and Vacuum Measurement Solutions business. We anticipate that this work will lead to a new wide-range, compact pressure measurement standard."</em> <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2019/02/floc-takes-flight-first-portable-prototype-photonic-pressure-sensor">[...]</a>

<p><em>"New material enhances supercurrent in topological-insulator nanoribbon Josephson junctions Quantum computers will process significantly more information at once compared to today's computers. But the building blocks that contain this information – quantum bits, or "qubits" – are way too sensitive to their surroundings to work well enough right now to build a practical quantum computer. Long story short, qubits need a better immune system before they can grow up. A new material, engineered by Purdue University researchers into a thin strip is one step closer to "immunizing" qubits against noise, such as heat and other parts of a computer, that interferes with how well they hold information. The work appears in Physical Review Letters. The thin strip, called a "nanoribbon," is a version of a material that conducts electrical current on its surface but not on the inside – called a "topological insulator" – with two superconductor electrical leads to form a device called a "Josephson junction.""</em> <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2019/Q1/immunizing-quantum-bits-so-that-they-can-grow-up.html">[...]</a>

The research team led by RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia, have developed a new technique that can efficiently convert CO2 from a gas into solid particles of carbon. Published in the journal Nature Communications, the research offers an alternative pathway for safely and permanently removing the greenhouse gas from our atmosphere. Current technologies for carbon capture and storage focus on compressing CO2 into a liquid form, transporting it to a suitable site and injecting it underground. But implementation has been hampered by engineering challenges, issues around economic viability and environmental concerns about possible leaks from the storage sites. RMIT researcher Dr Torben Daeneke said converting CO2 into a solid could be a more sustainable approach."</em> <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/news/all-news/2019/feb/carbon-dioxide-coal">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scientists at the U.S. Department of Energys Ames Laboratory have developed a method to accurately measure the exact edge or onset at which a magnetic field enters a superconducting material. The knowledge of this threshold called the lower critical field plays a crucial role in untangling the difficulties that have prevented the broader use of superconductivity in new technologies. In condensed matter physics, scientists distinguish between various superconducting states. When placed in a magnetic field, the upper critical field is the strength at which it completely destroys superconducting behavior in a material. The Meissner effect can be thought of as its opposite, which happens when a material transitions into a superconducting state, completely expelling a magnetic field from its interior, so that it is reduced to zero at a small (typically less than a micrometer) characteristic length called the London penetration depth. But what happens in the gray area between the two?"</em> <a href="https://www.ameslab.gov/news/news-releases/scientists-measure-exact-edge-between-superconducting-and-magnetic-states">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This experimental project shows how to build a simple PI (Pulse Induction) metal detector based on ATtiny13 / AVR microcontroller.My goals were to make a circuit as simple as possible and to use only popular / cheap electronic parts. The device has been tested with very small coil (55mm diameter, about 30 turns of 0.5 DNE) andonly 3V power supply. It’s my first design of PI metal detector and I’m really happy with the results! The prototype was able to detect little coins (6cm distance) and wires in the wall.The code is on Github, here. How It Works? Presented metal detector uses PI method togenerate a voltage spike in a search coil connected in parallel with capacitor.Next, ATtiny13 uses an Analog Comparator to measure a decay time to zero of resonant circuit.When a metal object nears the loop it will decreasetime it takes for the pulse to decay to zero."</em> <a href="https://blog.podkalicki.com/attiny13-pi-metal-detector/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"I love retro tech. It's so much fun to play with older tech since they are usually larger and more aesthetic than modern equivalents. The only problem with old tech such as Nixie tubes is that they are rare, expensive, and generally difficult to work with. Since the library near me just got a laser cutter for the public to use, I knew I had to make a project to learn how to use it. What better thing to do than combine my passion for old tech with lasers. These LED "Nixie" tubes are much cheaper, less dangerous, and can be powered off of USB power.If you like this project consider voting for it in the Faux-Real Contest.The template I used for my PCB was provided by Connor Nishijima on github (https://github.com/connornishijima/lixie-arduino)My original inspiration for this was the version that Make did (https://makezine.com/projects/led-nixie-display/), but Connor's PCB was much cheaper to produce."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Faux-Nixie-Tube-Clock/">[...]</a>

One of the primary motivations for this project was to try a wireless charging receiver in conjunction with a battery in an LED light. I've seen a lot of people add wireless charging transmitters to anything and everything, but haven't seen wireless charging receivers used in many projects, so I wanted to try one out. Make sure to check out the YouTube video at the top of this instructable, since often the video demonstration is helpful in understanding the instructions here.

<p><em>"Most micro-controllers use a quartz crystal oscillator to drive the system clock, and their resonant frequency is reasonably stable with temperature variations. In high accuracy applications like real time clocks even that temperature variation can be compensated, and last year I devised a way to measure temperature by comparing a 1-second pulse from a DS3231 to the uncompensated 8Mhz oscillator on a Pro Mini. This good clock / bad clock method worked to about 0.01°C, but the coding was complicated, and it relied on the ‘quality’ of the cheap RTC modules I was getting from fleaBay – which is never a good idea. But what if you could read temperature better than 0.01°C using the Pro Mini by itself? The 328P watchdog timer is driven by a separate internal oscillator circuit running at about 110 kHz. This RC oscillator is notoriously bad at keeping time, because that on-chip circuit is affected by external factors like temperature."</em> <a href="https://thecavepearlproject.org/2019/02/25/no-parts-temperature-measurement-with-arduino-pro-mini-to-0-005c-or-better/">[...]</a>

Assembly has a bad rap in today's modern tech culture. Due to large amounts of RAM and processing power, high-level languages like C# and Python have paved the way for huge levels of abstraction. In some cases, this has vastly improved productivity, yet in others has left an entire generation of programmers oblivious to what their code actually does. In this article, we'll use the foundation in assembly that you can build off of, while using one of the most widespread architectures there is.
