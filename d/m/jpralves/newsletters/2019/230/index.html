<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1754, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Proust">Joseph Proust</a>. Este químico francês provou que as quantidades relativas de qualquer elemento constituinte de um composto químico puro permanecem invariantes, independentemente da fonte do composto, fornecendo assim evidências cruciais para apoiar a "lei das proporções definidas" de John Dalton, que contém esses elementos em qualquer composto está presente em proporção fixa entre si.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1854, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bausch">Edward Bausch</a>. Este inventor norte-americano desenvolveu microscópios e instrumentos ópticos.</p>

<p>Esta semana que passou ficámos a saber que o telescópio gigantesco chinês encontra-se quase pronto. O maior rádio-telescópio de prato único do mundo está a preparar-se para abrir para astrónomos em todo o mundo, inaugurando uma era de observações sensíveis que podem ajudar na busca de ondas gravitacionais e sondar as misteriosas explosões fugazes de radiação conhecidas como rajadas rápidas de rádio.</p>

<p>Também esta semana a NASA detectou pulsos magnéticos misteriosos em Marte. Os eventos nocturnos estão entre os resultados iniciais da sonda InSight, que também encontrou pistas de que o planeta vermelho pode hospedar um reservatório global de água líquida bem abaixo da superfície. À meia-noite de Marte, o campo magnético do planeta vermelho às vezes começa a pulsar de maneiras nunca antes observadas. A causa é actualmente desconhecida.</p>

<p>Por fim, a NASA publicou um artigo de um pesquisador da Google que afirma ter alcançado a supremacia quântica, um importante marco inicial no campo da computação quântica, tendo o mesmo posteriormente sido removido. A Google, assim como a IBM, a Microsoft, a Intel e outras grandes empresas e startups de tecnologia, estão a trabalhar para construir computadores quânticos, um novo tipo de computador baseado numa arquitectura totalmente diferente da dos computadores clássicos. Embora este anúncio não seja oficial, há muito que cientistas e especialistas do sector esperam que a Google construa um computador quântico capaz de atingir esse marco - um computador quântico executando um cálculo que um computador clássico não pode.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. São também apresentadas as revistas newelectronics de 24 de Setembro e a MagPI Nº86 de Setembro.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02790-3">Gigantic Chinese telescope opens to astronomers worldwide</a></h2>

<p><em>"FAST has superior sensitivity to detect cosmic phenomena, including fast radio bursts and pulsars. The world’s largest single-dish radio observatory is preparing to open to astronomers around the world, ushering in an era of exquisitely sensitive observations that could help in the hunt for gravitational waves and probe the mysterious fleeting blasts of radiation known as fast radio bursts. The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST) in southern China has just passed a series of technical and performance assessments, and the Chinese government is expected to give the observatory the final green light to begin full operations at a review meeting scheduled for next month. “We do not see any roadblocks for the remaining transition,” says Di Li, the chief scientist of FAST. “I feel both excited and relieved.” The complex project has not been without challenges — it has a radical design and initially struggled to attract staff, in part because of its remote location. But the pay-off for science will be immense."</em> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02790-3">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The nighttime events are among initial results from the InSight lander, which also found hints that the red planet may host a global reservoir of liquid water deep below the surface. AT MIDNIGHT ON Mars, the red planet’s magnetic field sometimes starts to pulsate in ways that have never before been observed. The cause is currently unknown. That’s just one of the stunning preliminary findings from NASA’s very first robotic geophysicist there, the InSight lander. Since touching down in November 2018, this spacecraft has been gathering intel to help scientists better understand our neighboring planet’s innards and evolution, such as taking the temperature of its upper crust, recording the sounds of alien quakes, and measuring the strength and direction of the planet’s magnetic field. As revealed during a handful of presentations this week at a joint meeting of the European Planetary Science Congress and the American Astronomical Society, the early data suggest the magnetic machinations of Mars are marvelously mad."</em> <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2019/09/mars-insight-feels-mysterious-magnetic-pulsations-at-midnight/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A Google researcher’s paper claiming to have achieved quantum supremacy, a major early milestone in the field of quantum computing, appeared on a NASA website this week before being removed, the Financial Times reports. Google, as well as IBM, Microsoft, Intel, and other large tech companies and startups, have been working to build quantum computers, a new kind of computer based on an entirely different architecture than classical computers. Though this announcement is not official, scientists and industry experts have long expected Google to build a quantum computer capable of reaching this milestone—a quantum computer performing a calculation that a classical computer can’t. You can read our primer on quantum computers here and our primer on quantum supremacy here. But the gist is, classical computers are systems where problems are abstracted onto a system of two-position switches called bits (ones and zeros) that interact through the rules of logic. Quantum computers are instead based on quantum bits, or qubits, that are also two-position switches, but they interact via the same rules that subatomic particles follow, called quantum mechanics."</em> <a href="https://gizmodo.com/google-says-its-achieved-quantum-supremacy-a-world-fir-1838299829">[...]</a>

<p><em>"When Apollo 11’s lunar module, Eagle, landed on the Moon on July 20, 1969, it first flew over an area littered with boulders before touching down at the Sea of Tranquility. The site had been selected based on photos collected over two years as part of the Lunar Orbiter program. But the “sensors” that ensured Eagle was in a safe spot before touching down – those were the eyes of NASA Astronaut Neil Armstrong. “Eagle’s computer didn’t have a vision-aided system to navigate relative to the lunar terrain, so Armstrong was literally looking out the window to figure out where to touch down,” said Matthew Fritz, principal investigator for a terrain relative navigation system being developed by Draper of Cambridge, Massachusetts. “Now, our system could become the ‘eyes’ for the next lunar lander module to help target the desired landing location.” This week, that system will be tested in the desert of Mojave, California, on a launch and landing of Masten Space Systems’ Xodiac rocket. The rocket is scheduled to take off Wednesday, Sept. 11."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/flightopportunities/One_Giant_Leap_for_Lunar_Landing_Navigation">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Astronomers have spotted three giant black holes within a titanic collision of three galaxies. The unusual system was captured by several observatories, including three NASA space telescopes. "We were only looking for pairs of black holes at the time, and yet, through our selection technique, we stumbled upon this amazing system," said Ryan Pfeifle of George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, the first author of a new paper in The Astrophysical Journal describing these results. "This is the strongest evidence yet found for such a triple system of actively feeding supermassive black holes." The system is known as SDSS J084905.51+111447.2 (SDSS J0849+1114 for short) and is located a billion light years from Earth. To uncover this rare black hole trifecta, researchers needed to combine data from telescopes both on the ground and in space."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7506">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This new visualization of a black hole illustrates how its gravity distorts our view, warping its surroundings as if seen in a carnival mirror. The visualization simulates the appearance of a black hole where infalling matter has collected into a thin, hot structure called an accretion disk. The black hole’s extreme gravity skews light emitted by different regions of the disk, producing the misshapen appearance. Bright knots constantly form and dissipate in the disk as magnetic fields wind and twist through the churning gas. Nearest the black hole, the gas orbits at close to the speed of light, while the outer portions spin a bit more slowly. This difference stretches and shears the bright knots, producing light and dark lanes in the disk."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/nasa-visualization-shows-a-black-hole-s-warped-world">[...]</a>

<p><em>"China added two more satellites to the country’s Beidou navigation fleet — an analog to the U.S. military’s GPS network — with a successful Long March 3B rocket launch Sunday. The Long March 3B launcher lifted off from the Xichang space center in southwestern China’s Sichuan province at 2110 GMT (5:10 p.m. EDT) Sunday, according to the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, or CALT, a state-owned aerospace contractor. According to CALT, the Long March 3B and its Yuanzheng upper stage delivered two Beidou navigation satellites into the targeted medium Earth orbit. The 184-foot-tall (56-meter) Long March 3B rocket flew southeast from the Xichang launch base and shed its four liquid-fueled boosters nearly two-and-a-half minutes into the mission. Seconds later, the Long March 3B’s core stage shut down and separated. The Long March 3B’s hydrazine-fueled second stage fired next, followed by a burn of the rocket’s cryogenic hydrogen-fueled third stage before deployment of the Yuanzheng upper stage with the two Beidou navigation satellites."</em> <a href="https://spaceflightnow.com/2019/09/23/two-more-satellites-launched-into-chinas-beidou-navigation-fleet/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A University of Queensland-led international team of researchers say they have discovered “a new kind of quantum time order”. UQ physicist Dr Magdalena Zych said the discovery arose from an experiment the team designed to bring together elements of the two big – but contradictory – physics theories developed in the past century. “Our proposal sought to discover: what happens when an object massive enough to influence the flow of time is placed in a quantum state?” Dr Zych said. She said Einstein’s theory described how the presence of a massive object slowed time. “Imagine two space ships, asked to fire at each other at a specified time while dodging the other’s attack,” she said. “If either fires too early, it will destroy the other.” “In Einstein’s theory, a powerful enemy could use the principles of general relativity by placing a massive object – like a planet – closer to one ship to slow the passing of time.” “Because of the time lag, the ship furthest away from the massive object will fire earlier, destroying the other.” Dr Zych said the second theory, of quantum mechanics, says any object can be in a state of “superposition” “This means it can be found in different states – think Schrodinger’s cat,” she said."</em> <a href="https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2019/08/physicists-mash-quantum-and-gravity-and-find-time-not-we-know-it">[...]</a>

<p><em>"It is safe to say that 3D displays do not necessarily occur in nature – unless one considers the cephalopod, which includes the squid and octopus, as a living 3D display which can morph its structure and create complex shapes and textures for camouflage purposes or drag control (see video). Now, a research team from the University of Iowa and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is developing a smart skin inspired by the cephalopod which can be used in 3D displays, as interfaces for the visually impaired, and to help reduce drag on marine vehicles. In a study published in Advanced Materials Technologies, the team, led by Caterina Lamuta, assistant professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Iowa, as well as Sameh Tawfick and Nancy Sottos, professors at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, found that using twisted and coiled polymer fibers to create artificial muscles could produce lightweight smart skins that are capable of fine motion and shape modulation. In cephalopods, voxels are controlled by the animal’s papillae muscles which allow their skin to take numerous forms, protrude outward, and take new shapes in fractions of seconds (see video, see video). The team took inspiration from the cephalopods’ papillae to reproduce digital texture voxels (DTVs) from twisted spiral artificial muscles (TSAMs). With an input voltage of only 0.2 V/cm, TSAMs provide a stroke of 2000% and a roughness profile ranging from a few microns to one centimeter."</em> <a href="https://www.engineering.uiowa.edu/news/researchers-recreate-living-3d-displays">[...]</a>

With support from the National Science Foundation, computer scientists at The University of Texas at Dallas are going after some of the hardest-to-find errors, called variability bugs, which appear only when software is configured to work with certain hardware. The researchers presented a framework they developed to detect variability bugs at the recent Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Joint European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering in Estonia. Variability bugs cannot typically be detected using off-the-shelf software analysis tools, said Dr. Shiyi Wei, assistant professor of computer science in the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science. “It is hard to test and analyze software for variability bugs because of all of the different hardware involved,” Wei said. “You have to test many software configurations to find these bugs, and it’s not possible to test all the configurations.” A software program can have millions of configurations that allow it to operate among different models and brands of computers and devices."</em> <a href="https://www.utdallas.edu/news/research/computer-bugs-tool-2019/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The advance – using an electrical push rather than a pull – could lead to more reliable medical diagnostic tools Matthew Chin | August 26, 2019 When medical laboratories analyze blood samples for signs of disease, they sometimes use instruments that rely on a technology called digital microfluidics. The technique uses electric signals to pull tiny droplets of the sample across a surface so they can be analyzed. One drawback of the process is that the electric signals tend to damage the surface that the droplets travel over, which can cause the device to fail unexpectedly or deteriorate over time. Now, a research team led by UCLA engineers and scientists has demonstrated that digital microfluidic devices could be made much more durable if they use the electric signals to push, instead of pull, the droplets over the surface. A paper about the work was published in Nature. The advance could lead to more powerful and reliable analytical tools for biochemical laboratories and environmental monitoring."</em> <a href="http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/electrical-signals-move-liquid-droplets-electrodewetting">[...]</a>

In modern electronic computer processors, miniaturized to just a few nanometers, only less than ten dopant atoms are relevant for the functionality. Quantum components, which are used for novel quantum computers or quantum simulators, will go even one step further in that they require an array with only single dopant atoms in a high-purity crystal.

From raindrops rolling off the waxy surface of a waterlily leaf, to the efficiency of desalination membranes, interactions between water molecules and water-repellent "hydrophobic" surfaces are all around us. The interplay becomes even more intriguing when a thin water layer becomes sandwiched between two hydrophobic surfaces, KAUST researchers have shown. In the early 1980s, researchers first noted an unexpected effect when two hydrophobic surfaces were slowly brought together in water. “At some point, the two surfaces would suddenly jump into contact—like two magnets being brought together,” says Himanshu Mishra from KAUST's Water Desalination and Reuse Center.

PAXEL, which stands for photonic accelerator, is placed at the front end of a digital computer and optimized to perform specific functions but with less power consumption than is needed for fully electronic devices. Metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors are the basis for most integrated electronic circuits, but they are limited by Moore’s Law, which says the number of microprocessor chips on a single electronic circuit will double every two years. There is an inherent limit to this, though, based on the way the size of the microprocessor chips relates to the quantum mechanical nature of electrons. It is possible to partially overcome the Moore’s Law problem by using parallel processing, in which multiple processors carry out simultaneous computations.

<p><em>"Physicists manipulate energy valleys in tungsten disulfide, with potential applications in quantum computing New research on two-dimensional tungsten disulfide (WS2) could open the door to advances in quantum computing. In a paper published Sept. 13 in Nature Communications, scientists report that they can manipulate the electronic properties of this super-thin material in ways that could be useful for encoding quantum data. The study deals with WS2’s energy valleys, which University at Buffalo physicist Hao Zeng, co-lead author of the paper, describes as “the local energy extrema of the electronic structure in a crystalline solid.” Valleys correspond with specific energies that electrons can have in a material, and the presence of an electron in one valley versus another can be used to encode information. An electron in one valley can represent a 1 in binary code, while an electron in the other can represent a 0. The ability to control where electrons might be found could yield advances in quantum computing, enabling the creation of qubits, the basic unit of quantum information. Qubits have the mysterious quality of being able to exist not just in a state of 1 or 0, but in a “superposition” related to both states."</em> <a href="https://www.buffalo.edu/news/releases/2019/002/030.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"POV Fidget spinner which uses Enhanced PIC16 AngularTimer peripheral, Bluetooth Low Energy 4.2 link, LabVIEW PC application, touch button... This is a fidget spinner which uses Persistence of Vision effect which is an optical illusion whereby multiple discrete images blend into a single image in the human mind. The text or graphics can be changed via Bluetooth Low Energy link by using a PC application that I have programmed in LabVIEW or by using a freely available smartphone BLE app. One of the most important characteristics is that the displayed graphics doesnt depend on rotation velocity thanks to its innovative solution for keeping the track of rotation angle. Meaning that the displayed graphic is perceived the same at both, higher and lower rotational speeds (for instance, when the fidget spinner is slowing down when held in the hand). This is also one of the main difference between various POV device on the market (POV clocks, etc.)"</em> <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/165210-persistence-of-vision-fidget-spinner">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This project started when my girlfriend was complaining about the large empty feature wall of our new apartment. Since we both decided to hang something up there, I knew I wanted to put something of my own design up there. I started researching for inspiration across the and ended up reading a lot of Instructables which are pretty amazing, with some unique and beautiful designs. But what I kept finding is that most require either expensive tools such as 3D printers and CNC routers, or items that are highly specific to their design like old lamp shades or car bumpers for example. I have many of these great tools available to me since I am a development engineer in heavy industry. But I wanted to challenge myself and build the most Super Simple WiFi RGB LED Lamp that anyone can build."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Super-Simple-RGB-WiFi-Lamp/">[...]</a>

Devices which have no function or which malfunction are not considered to be "useless box". The most well-known "useless box" are those inspired by Marvin Minsky's design, in which the device's sole function is to switch itself off by operating its own "off" switch. More elaborate devices and novelty toys, having some obvious function or entertainment value, have been based on these simple "useless box".

The programming of the micro:bit is unbelievably simple and has a whole bunch of sensors built in for future upgrades I could possibly make to this project. - 1x ATMEGA328 5V 16MHz Arduino (basically a knockoff Arduino Pro Mini) used for controlling the neopixels as the micro:bit cannot run regular Arduino code with third party libraries so a simple arduino was needed to act as an interface between the micro:bit and Neopixels. - 8x NeoPixel Sticks &amp; 1x NeoPixel Ring for providing super high quality LEDs to the project."</em> <a href="https://manoj.ninja/articles/2019/09/19/2019-building-a-gesture-controlled-lamp">[...]</a>
