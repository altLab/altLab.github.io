<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1885, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_de_Hevesy">George de Hevesy</a>. Este químico húngaro-dinamarquês-sueco recebeu o Prémio Nobel de 1943 por desenvolver técnicas de traçador isotópico que permitiram entender os caminhos químicos dos processos da vida. Por exemplo, um isótopo radioactivo de fósforo, preparado em soluções de fosfato de sódio pode ser injectado em animais e humanos, e amostras de sangue são analisadas. Isto mostra que o conteúdo de fósforo radioactivo no sangue humano cai depois de apenas 2 horas para apenas 2% de sua quantidade original, à medida que muda de lugar com os átomos de fósforo dentro dos tecidos, órgãos e esqueleto. Ele também descobriu, com Dirk Coster, o elemento hafnium (1923).</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1889, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Gerlach">Walter Gerlach</a>. Este físico alemão ficou conhecido pelo seu trabalho com Otto Stern sobre as de-flexões de átomos em um campo magnético não homogéneo. A experiência Stern-Gerlach é uma demonstração da orientação espacial restrita de partículas atómicas e subatómicas com polaridade magnética, realizada no início da década de 1920 pelos físicos alemães Otto Stern e Walther Gerlach. Na experiência, um feixe de átomos de prata neutros foi direccionado através de um conjunto de fendas alinhadas, depois através de um campo magnético não uniforme (não homogéneo).</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1924, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Charpak">Georges Charpak</a>. Este Físico polaco-francês recebeu o Prémio Nobel de Física em 1992 pela sua invenção e desenvolvimento de detectores de partículas subatómicas, em particular a câmara proporcional multi-filar, um avanço na técnica para explorar as partes mais internas da matéria. Como os físicos de partículas têm focado o seu interesse em interacções de partículas muito raras, que frequentemente revelam os segredos das partes internas da matéria, às vezes apenas uma interacção de partículas em um bilião é a única pesquisada. Charpak substituiu agora métodos fotográficos inadequados por electrónicos modernos que ligavam o detector directamente a um computador.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1945, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Osheroff">Douglas Osheroff</a>. Este físico norte-americano partilhou com David M. Lee e Robert Richardson) o Prémio Nobel de Física de 1996 pela descoberta da super-fluidez no isótopo hélio-3. Quando o hélio é reduzido na temperatura em direcção ao quase zero absoluto, ocorre uma estranha transição de fase, e o hélio toma a forma de um superfluido. Os átomos tinham até esse ponto movido-se com velocidades e direcções aleatórias. Mas como um superfluido, os átomos passam a mover-se de forma coordenada.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que a Fujitsi mantém em pleno funcionamento um computador feito em 1959. Um técnico - Tadao Hamada - de 49 anos assegura o seu funcionamento. Ele acredita que manter a operacionalidade histórica do FACOM128B ajudará a levar a herança tecnológica do Japão à posteridade. O computador, que pesa três toneladas, faz barulhos ruidosos cada vez que faz um cálculo abrindo e fechando interruptores usando um electro-íman. O modelo FACOM128B, desenvolvido pela Fujitsu em 1959 como um computador pioneiro fabricado no Japão para competir com a International Business Machines Corp. nos Estados Unidos, adoptou a tecnologia de retransmissão usada no núcleo das centrais telefónicas.</p>

<p>Também esta semana que passou ficámos a saber que a Intel lançou a primeira 10ª geração de processadores Intel Core. Estes novos processadores da 10ª Geração Intel Core mudam o paradigma do que significa entregar liderança em plataformas de PC móvel. Com IA em larga escala pela primeira vez em PCs, uma arquitectura gráfica totalmente nova, o melhor da classe Wi-Fi 6 (Gig +) e Thunderbolt 3 - todos integrados no SoC, graças à tecnologia de processo de 10 nm da Intel.</p>

<p>Ainda esta semana que passou um grupo de investigadores publicou um artigo onde descreve lentes de contacto que podem mudar o foco e a ampliação quando se pisca os olhos. Há duas partes na nova lente de contacto, a primeira é a própria lente, que imita como a lente no olho humano funciona. Em vez de tecido orgânico, é feito de camadas de filmes de polímeros elásticos que alteram sua estrutura quando uma corrente eléctrica é aplicada. Nesse caso, os fios fornecem electricidade de uma fonte de energia externa, o que faz com que as camadas se expandam, reduzindo a espessura da lente ou contraindo, o que tem o efeito oposto.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. São também apresentados um conjunto de livros escritos por James M. Fiore sobre electrónica.</p>

<p><em>"Long obsolete and not just a museum piece, an early massive computer developed 60 years ago remains working, thanks to a technician dedicated to preserving it for future generations. Tadao Hamada believes that keeping the historic FACOM128B operational will help hand down Japan's technological heritage to posterity.“I will maintain it forever,” said Hamada, 49. Hamada, an employee of Fujitsu Tokki Systems Ltd., a Fujitsu Ltd. subsidiary, works at a plant here to preserve the aged computer, which weighs three tons. It makes rattling sounds each time it makes a calculation by opening and closing switches using an electromagnet. The FACOM128B model, which was developed by Fujitsu in 1959 as a pioneering Japan-made computer to compete with International Business Machines Corp. in the United States, adopted relay technology used for the core part of telephone switchboards. Use of vacuum tubes instead of relay technology was common at the time."</em> <a href="http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201907280007.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://gizmodo.com/contact-lenses-that-can-change-focus-and-zoom-when-you-1836789660">Contact Lenses That Can Change Focus and Zoom When You Blink Move Closer to Reality</a></h2>

<p><em>"Believe it or not, contact lenses are still an option for those who wear glasses that accommodate multiple prescriptions, but because of the unique approach they take to remedying vision problems, it can sometimes take over a month to get used to using them. Researchers at the University of California San Diego have created a better alternative with a prototype contact lens that can automatically switch between focusing on near or far objects by detecting the wearer’s eye movements. It sounds like a medical breakthrough straight out of science fiction, and for the time being, it kind of is. It will take years before the contact lens can function as promised directly on a human eye. The prototype only functions in a special rig using several components that will have to be dramatically miniaturized before a human could wear it, and the test subjects look less than comfortable with a series of electrodes placed on their skin around their eyes. But it demonstrates some fascinating uses of existing technology that could make contacts a viable alternative for more users."</em> <a href="https://gizmodo.com/contact-lenses-that-can-change-focus-and-zoom-when-you-1836789660">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Less than two years ago, Tesla built and installed the world’s largest lithium-ion battery in Hornsdale, South Australia, using Tesla Powerpack batteries. Since then, the facility saved nearly $40 million in its first year alone and helped to stabilize and balance the region’s unreliable grid. Battery storage is transforming the global electric grid and is an increasingly important element of the world’s transition to sustainable energy. To match global demand for massive battery storage projects like Hornsdale, Tesla designed and engineered a new battery product specifically for utility-scale projects: Megapack. Megapack significantly reduces the complexity of large-scale battery storage and provides an easy installation and connection process. Each Megapack comes from the factory fully-assembled with up to 3 megawatt hours (MWhs) of storage and 1.5 MW of inverter capacity, building on Powerpack’s engineering with an AC interface and 60% increase in energy density to achieve significant cost and time savings compared to other battery systems and traditional fossil fuel power plants."</em> <a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/introducing-megapack-utility-scale-energy-storage">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The wait is finally over, the Arduino Nano 33 BLE and BLE Sense are both available. The boards have been manufactured, delivered to our warehouses, and will start shipping in mid-August. These new boards are an exciting addition to our product line — based on the powerful Nordic nRF52840 Bluetooth SoC, a Cortex-M4F Arm processor with advanced Bluetooth capabilities. Together with the u-blox NINA B306 module, the BLE Sense in particular delivers a lot of value through its impressive array of onboard sensors: a 9-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU), temperature, pressure, humidity, light, color, and even gesture sensors, as well as a microphone, that are managed through our specialized libraries. To coincide with the launch of the boards we’re making the official Arduino programming support for this processor available — in Arduino slang what we call a “Core.” The ArduinoCore-nRF528x-mbedos that you will be able to add to your Arduino IDE in a few hours is based on the Arm Mbed OS Real-Time Operating System. This is an amazing addition to the Arduino software stack because now you can transparently take full advantage of a powerful RTOS while using all your existing Arduino programming knowledge."</em> <a href="https://blog.arduino.cc/2019/07/31/the-arduino-nano-33-ble-and-ble-sense-are-officially-available/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A team of EPFL researchers has set itself the lofty goal of building the biggest-ever database that digitizes the visual appearance of all natural and synthetic materials in the world. Is it possible to digitally replicate the way light shines off silk, the kaleidoscope of colors on butterfly wings, or the structure of fabrics, plastics, and stones? A team of researchers at EPFL’s Realistic Graphics Lab, headed by Wenzel Jakob, is developing computer models to do just that. Their process begins by meticulously digitizing any material they can lay their hands on, using a sophisticated machine called a gonio-photometer. Imagine taking a photo of a car on a sunny day: the picture will only capture its appearance for that specific viewpoint and illumination, but it cannot tell us how the same car would look from another viewpoint later in the evening. In contrast to a camera, a gonio-photometer measures the light reflected by a material at different angles, capturing the essence of what gives the car’s painted surface its particular look: shiny, pearlescent, metallic, faded, etc."</em> <a href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/digitizing-and-replicating-the-world-of-materials/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"By analyzing single particles of light, this camera system can reconstruct room-size scenes and moving objects that are hidden around a corner. This work could someday help autonomous cars and robots see better. David Lindell, a graduate student in electrical engineering at Stanford University, donned a high visibility tracksuit and got to work, stretching, pacing and hopping across an empty room. Through a camera aimed away from Lindell – at what appeared to be a blank wall – his colleagues could watch his every move. That’s because, hidden to the naked eye, he was being scanned by a high powered laser and the single particles of light he reflected onto the walls around him were captured and reconstructed by the camera’s advanced sensors and processing algorithm. “People talk about building a camera that can see as well as humans for applications such as autonomous cars and robots, but we want to build systems that go well beyond that,” said Gordon Wetzstein, an assistant professor of electrical engineering at Stanford."</em> <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2019/07/29/seeing-moving-objects-around-corners/">[...]</a>

Very often, this wasted energy escapes as heat, or thermal energy, from inefficient technology that fails to harvest that potential power. Now a team at the University of Massachusetts Amherst led by chemist Dhandapani Venkataraman, “DV,” and electrical engineer Zlatan Aksamija, report this month in Nature Communications on an advance they outline toward more efficient, cheaper, polymer-based harvest of heat energy. “It will be a surprise to the field,” DV predicts, “it gives us another key variable we can alter to improve the thermo-electric efficiency of polymers. This should make us, and others, look at polymer thermo-electrics in a new light.” Aksamija explains, “Using polymers to convert thermal energy to electricity by harvesting waste heat has seen an uptick in interest in recent years. Waste heat represents both a problem but also a resource; the more heat your process wastes, the less efficient it is.” Harvesting waste heat is less difficult when there is a local, high-temperature gradient source to work with, he adds, such as a high-grade heat source like a power plant."</em> <a href="https://www.umass.edu/newsoffice/article/how-capture-waste-heat-energy-improved">[...]</a>

Instead of processing discrete ones and zeros, quantum information, whether stored in electron spins or transmitted by laser photons, can be in a superposition of multiple states simultaneously. Moreover, the states of two or more objects can become entangled, so that the status of one cannot be completely described without this other.

The electronic structure of a material describes how electrons behave within that material, and therefore the nature of the current flowing through it.

Transfer printing works in a way similar to that of a tattoo sticker—sticking the tattoo sticker on the skin and then removing the paper backing leaves an image on the skin. The newly developed process creates a structure on one surface and then transfers it to another in a similar way. The most notable advantage of this process is that it largely avoids the difficulties involved in creating devices directly on substrates that are thermally and/or chemically sensitive, which is why transfer printing is widely used for the manufacturing of flexible devices. On the other hand, the primary disadvantage of the current transfer printing processes is that they can usually only be used for substrates with flat surfaces."</em> <a href="https://phys.org/news/2019-07-team-technology-flexible-sensors-topographic.html">[...]</a>

By applying a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of graphene, the current-carrying electrons are forced to move in closed circular “cyclotron” orbits. In pure graphene, the only way in which an electron can escape from this orbit is by bouncing off a “phonon” in a scattering event.

<h2><a href="https://www.mpsd.mpg.de/540136/2019-07-quantum_uncertainty-rokaj">Quantum uncertainty helps solve an old problem</a></h2>

<p><em>"Controlling how electrons zip through a material is of central importance to build novel electronic devices. How the electronic motion is affected by magnetic fields is an old problem that has not been fully solved, yet has already led to multiple physics Nobel prizes. Now researchers at the Max Planck Institute for the Structure and Dynamics of Matter in Hamburg have solved one of the long-standing problems in the field, namely how a certain symmetry can be restored. Their results were just published in Physical Review Letters. Electrons moving in a strong magnetic field perform a circular motion due to the Lorentz force, on which electromagnetic induction and the electric motor are based. In the quantum flatland of atomically thin two-dimensional materials, this leads to weird quantum effects like the integer and the fractional quantized Hall effects, which state that the number of Lorentz-deflected charges are not arbitrary but increase in discrete (quantized) steps."</em> <a href="https://www.mpsd.mpg.de/540136/2019-07-quantum_uncertainty-rokaj">[...]</a>

There are many ways to generate electricity—batteries, solar panels, wind turbines, and hydroelectric dams, to name a few examples. …. And now there's rust.

<p><em>"Rutgers-led research could help reduce energy use, improve electronic devices When two mesh screens are overlaid, beautiful patterns appear when one screen is offset. These “moiré patterns” have long intrigued artists, scientists and mathematicians and have found applications in printing, fashion and banknotes. Now, a Rutgers-led team has paved the way to solving one of the most enduring mysteries in materials physics by discovering that in the presence of a moiré pattern in graphene, electrons organize themselves into stripes, like soldiers in formation. Their findings, published in the journal Nature, could help in the search for quantum materials, such as superconductors, that would work at room temperature. Such materials would dramatically reduce energy consumption by making power transmission and electronic devices more efficient. “Our findings provide an essential clue to the mystery connecting a form of graphene, called twisted bilayer graphene, to superconductors that could work at room temperature,” said senior author Eva Y. Andrei, Board of Governors professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy in the School of Arts and Sciences at Rutgers University–New Brunswick."</em> <a href="https://news.rutgers.edu/physicists-make-graphene-discovery-could-help-develop-superconductors/20190731">[...]</a>

<p><em>"New research provides a look at how India could meet its climate targets while maintaining economic growth India’s economy is booming, driving up electric power consumption to unprecedented levels. The nation’s installed electricity capacity, which increased fivefold in the past three decades, is expected to triple over the next 20 years. At the same time, India has committed to limiting its carbon dioxide emissions growth; its Paris Agreement climate pledge is to decrease its carbon dioxide emissions intensity of GDP (CO2 emissions per unit of GDP) by 33 to 35 percent by 2030 from 2005 levels, and to boost carbon-free power to about 40 percent of installed capacity in 2030. Can India reach its climate targets without adversely impacting its rate of economic growth — now estimated at 7 percent annually — and what policy strategy would be most effective in achieving that goal? To address these questions, researchers from the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change developed an economy-wide model of India with energy-sector detail, and applied it to simulate the achievement of each component of the nation’s Paris pledge. Representing the emissions intensity target with an economy-wide carbon price and the installed capacity target with a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), they assessed the economic implications of three policy scenarios — carbon pricing, an RPS, and a combination of carbon pricing with an RPS."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/lowering-india-emissions-without-breaking-bank-0731">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Virtual reality (VR) seems so lifelike—until you try to reach out and touch something. Now, researchers have solved this tactile problem—with a new kind of glove that allows wearers to actually feel objects in their artificial environments without clunky machines weighing down their arms. Existing VR gloves mostly allow the users to feel the texture of an object using vibrations. They don’t sense shape, or they require heavy motors or air compressors to put pressure on the users’ hands to do so. In the new study, researchers wanted to make a light, nonrestrictive glove with an open palm that felt natural to wear, while providing realistic feedback when the user touched a virtual object. To create the glove, they outfitted a piece of soft silicone with sensors that detect hand motions and actuators—small silicone bubbles coupled with electrodes to generate an electric force—that provide physical feedback to the user’s fingertips."</em> <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/07/watch-lightweight-glove-allow-users-feel-objects-virtual-reality">[...]</a>

<p><em>"I have been experimenting using different ESP32 development boards, recently I ordered of the TTGO T-Beam variety which come with a Battery socket to add your own 18650 Lipo, this really takes some of the power regulation complexity out of building a small robot, as it has the battery and charger circuit in place already. However to directly drive something from this board it needed something low powered, so I decided to add some continuous rotation servos I have had for a while. The ESP32 board I used here has a lot of functionality including Lora radio and GPS, which may be useful in the future, but you can get ESP32 boards without these extras which make the board a bit smaller and still come with the 18650 battery holder. So let's start talking about the build. Supplies:4 x Continuous rotation Servos 4 x Wheels that fit on the Servos 1 x strip of 5 x Neopixels if you want to add them. 1 x ESP32 with ideally built in rechargeable battery, or an ESP32 with an external battery."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/ESP32-Robot-Using-Servos/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The first prototype of any circuit doesn’t always work almost never works 100% like expected and therefore troubleshooting is an essential part of the engineering process. This usually involves taking measurements of the circuit and tweaking things as needed. Commonly this is done with an oscilloscope, just probe the voltage of any signal and see how it changes over time. However in some (rare) situations the light generated by a circuit is the "signal" you care about. Measuring the drive voltage/ current is not always possible and is also inaccurate. Personally I am curious about how the typical 0.96" OLED screen works, especially how the configuration settings, the panel voltage and the segment current effect the light output."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Light-Probe-MK-I/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This is a collaboration with my son, who isn't old enough to have his own instructables account. He had the original idea of a vertical planter system with circulating water. His initial plan was to circulate the water through the dirt in each pot, so that nutrients wouldn't drain out of the pots but be circulated back to the top. He also wanted it to be more like a set of posts. After we talked about it for a bit, we decided it probably wasn't a good idea to run the water through the soil as this would over water the plants and could also clog up the pump. I did some research and we learned about the ancient irrigation method using "ollas", which are clay pots that hold water and slowly leak into the soil."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Circulating-Self-Watering-Vertical-Planter/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This is document is a sort of How to guide slash documentation that goes through process it took me to understand the concepts to achieve my goal of building a simple quadcopter that I could control from my mobile phone. To do this project I wanted to get an idea of what a drone actually is, in my case a quadcopter, so I started doing some research. I watched a lot of YouTube videos, read a bunch of articles and Insructible pages and this is what I got. Essentially you can split a drone into two parts. I called it the Physical and the Controller. The Physical is essentially everything that has to do with the mechanics that makes the drone fly."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/The-Guide-I-Wished-I-Had-on-Building-an-Arduino-Dr/">[...]</a>
