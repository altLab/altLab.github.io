<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1860, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Winton">Alexander Winton</a>. Este americano nascido na Escócia, fabricante de automóveis colocou milhares de "Winton Sixes" na estrada. Tendo começado como um fabricante de bicicletas no West Side de Cleveland, Winton tornou-se designer e construtor de automóveis de alta qualidade. Ele produziu a sua primeira carruagem sem cavalos em 1896. O legado de Winton inclui mais de 100 patentes instrumentais nos primeiros projectos de automóveis e motores a diesel. Ele também foi generoso ao passar a tecnologia para os concorrentes quando a segurança era um problema.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que o satélite de navegação Glonass-M irá iniciar a sua operação brevemente.

<p><em>"The Russian Glonass-M navigation satellite launched into orbit in late May will go into operation on 22 June, the GLONASS information centre said Wednesday, adding that a previous device has been transferred to an orbital reserve. "According to GLONASS System Control Centre, the Glonass-M 758 (orbital slot 12) is set to enter the orbital constellation on 22 June 2019", the centre said in a statement. The Glonass-M 758 satellite will replace Glonass-M satellite 723, which has exceeded its expected service life by some 50 percent. The Glonass constellation comprises 27 satellites, including Glonass-M and Glonass-K vehicles. The satellites circle the Earth at an altitude of about 11,000 miles and ensure complete coverage of the surface and global signal availability. Next-generation Glonass-K and Glonass-K2 satellites transmit more navigation signals and have a longer design life - up to 10 years - in comparison with Glonass-M devices."</em> <a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201906201075970492-cutting-edge-russian-glonass-m-navigation-satellite-to-begin-operation-soon---statement/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A teenager who shattered his skull falling from a cliff at Cape Byron in northern New South Wales will undergo surgery to have a piece of 3D printing fitted to his damaged skull. Fifteen-year-old Connor Meldrum will undergo the surgery at the Mater Hospital in Brisbane this week. The custom-printed section of skull is made of a high-density porous polyethylene material that mimics the properties of living bone. Mater Hospital neurosurgeon Rob Campbell said the technology was world class. "It mimics natural bone with its elastic capability and strength, allowing tissue to grow in and incorporate the implant to the skull," Dr Campbell said. The technology has been developed by a Melbourne-based biomedical company and commercialised in the past year with the help a Federal Government grant."</em> <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-06-16/3d-printing-to-help-repair-teenagers-skull-after-cliff-accident/11210998">[...]</a>

<p><em>"With data rates of up to 153.6 kSPS and a compact package size, the 24-bit and 16-bit ADCs improve system performance in high precision applications. The rapidly growing market of high precision applications requires Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) with faster programmable data rates, higher accuracy and more integrated features to maximize system performance. To meet these needs, Microchip Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP) today introduced a family of compact ADCs that offer high programmable data rates of up to 153.6 kilosamples per second (kSPS). The 24-bit MCP356x and 16-bit MCP346x delta-sigma ADC families offer faster programmable data rates over similar devices on the market while providing high accuracy and lower noise performance. Available in a tiny 3 mm x 3 mm UQFN-20 package, these highly integrated ADCs meet increasing demand for small packaging in space-constrained applications such as portable instrumentation devices. Most high-resolution delta-sigma ADCs on the market have slower programmable data rates of a few kSPS."</em> <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en/pressreleasepage/fast-data-rates-meet-high-accuracy-in-microchip-s">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Investigators from the ICN2 Advanced Electron Nanoscopy Group have collaborated in an international research to show that inorganic ligands can be used to improve the performance as a thermoelectric material of SnTe-CdSe nanocomposites. The efficiency obtained with this procedure is the highest reported for this material and was highlighted in the front cover of JACS. Everybody knows that electrical devices get hot. However, the other way around is also possible: the search for thermoelectric materials, able to efficiently convert heat into electricity, has been a longstanding challenge. A material’s thermoelectric performance is usually evaluated through a coefficient called figure of merit (ZT). The best thermoelectric materials known so far have reached a ZT just above 1."</em> <a href="https://icn2.cat/en/news/4311-better-thermoelectric-materials-thanks-to-ligand-mediation">[...]</a>

<p><em>"New research shows how materials can be imbued with new chemical properties using a solid phase transition method that relies on extremely fast pulses of light. Most people think of water as existing in only one of three phases: solid ice, liquid water, or gas vapor. But matter can exist in many different phases—ice, for example, has more than ten known phases, or ways that its atoms can be spatially arranged. The widespread use of piezoelectric materials, such as microphones and ultrasound, is possible thanks to a fundamental understanding of how an external force, like pressure, temperature, or electricity, can lead to phase transitions that imbue materials with new properties. A new study finds that a metal oxide has a “hidden” phase, one that gives the material new, ferroelectric properties, the ability to separate positive and negative charges, when it is activated by extremely fast pulses of light. The research was led by MIT researchers Keith A. Nelson, Xian Li, and Edoardo Baldini, in collaboration with Andrew M. Rappe and graduate students Tian Qiu and Jiahao Zhang."</em> <a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/revealing-hidden-phases-matter-through-power-light">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A new 3-D printed thermoelectric device, which converts heat into electric power with an efficiency factor over 50% higher than the previous best for printed materials - and is cheap to produce in bulk - has been manufactured by researchers at Swansea University’s SPECIFIC Innovation and Knowledge Centre. Around one-sixth of all the energy used by industry in the UK currently ends up as waste heat, emitted into the atmosphere. Harnessing this to create electricity could be a huge step forward in helping industry cut its energy bills and reduce its carbon footprint. Thermoelectric materials turn differences in temperature into electric power, or vice versa. They are used in fridges, power plants and even some smart watches that are powered by body heat. Previous research has shown that a material called tin selenide (SnSe), a compound made up of tin (Sn) and selenium (Se), has high potential as a thermoelectric material."</em> <a href="https://www.swansea.ac.uk/press-office/latest-research/turningwasteheatintoelectricalpower3dprinteddevicecouldhelpcutenergybillsandcarbon.php">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A new low-power magnetic switching component could aid spintronic devices UTokyo researchers have created an electronic component that demonstrates functions and abilities important to future generations of computational logic and memory devices. It is between one and two orders of magnitude more power efficient than previous attempts to create a component with the same kind of behavior. This fact could help it realize developments in the emerging field of spintronics. If you’re a keen technophile and like to keep up to date with current and future developments in the field of computing, you might have come across the emerging field of spintronic devices. In a nutshell, spintronics explores the possibility of high-performance, low-power components for logic and memory. It’s based around the idea of encoding information into the spin — a property related to angular momentum — of an electron, rather than by using packets of electrons to represent logical bits, 1s and 0s."</em> <a href="https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/focus/en/press/z0508_00053.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A team of researchers from Jülich in cooperation with the University of Magdeburg has developed a new method to measure the electric potentials of a sample at atomic accuracy. Using conventional methods, it was virtually impossible until now to quantitatively record the electric potentials that occur in the immediate vicinity of individual molecules or atoms. The new scanning quantum dot microscopy method, which was recently presented in the journal Nature Materials by scientists from Forschungszentrum Jülich together with partners from two other institutions, could open up new opportunities for chip manufacture or the characterization of biomolecules such as DNA. The positive atomic nuclei and negative electrons of which all matter consists produce electric potential fields that superpose and compensate each other, even over very short distances. Conventional methods do not permit quantitative measurements of these small-area fields, which are responsible for many material properties and functions on the nanoscale. Almost all established methods capable of imaging such potentials are based on the measurement of forces that are caused by electric charges."</em> <a href="https://www.fz-juelich.de/SharedDocs/Pressemitteilungen/UK/EN/2019/notifications/2019-06-12-quantum-dot-microscope.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"MIT CSAIL system can learn to see by touching and feel by seeing, suggesting future where robots can more easily grasp and recognize objects. In Canadian author Margaret Atwood’s book "Blind Assassins," she says that “touch comes before sight, before speech. It’s the first language and the last, and it always tells the truth.” While our sense of touch gives us a channel to feel the physical world, our eyes help us immediately understand the full picture of these tactile signals. Robots that have been programmed to see or feel can’t use these signals quite as interchangeably. To better bridge this sensory gap, researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) have come up with a predictive artificial intelligence (AI) that can learn to see by touching, and learn to feel by seeing. The team’s system can create realistic tactile signals from visual inputs, and predict which object and what part is being touched directly from those tactile inputs."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/teaching-ai-to-connect-senses-vision-touch-0617">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers have found a simple formula that could be useful for air purification, space propulsion, and molecular analyses. When a raindrop falls through a thundercloud, it is subject to strong electric fields that pull and tug on the droplet, like a soap bubble in the wind. If the electric field is strong enough, it can cause the droplet to burst apart, creating a fine, electrified mist. Scientists began taking notice of how droplets behave in electric fields in the early 1900s, amid concerns over lightning strikes that were damaging newly erected power lines. They soon realized that the power lines’ own electric fields were causing raindrops to burst around them, providing a conductive path for lightning to strike. This revelation led engineers to design thicker coverings around power lines to limit lightning strikes."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/electrified-droplet-air-purification-0617">[...]</a>

When these widgets are attached to a mobile device and a user interacts with them, the widgets’ nonlinear mechanical response shifts the device slightly and quickly, and this subtle motion can be detected by the accelerometer commonly equipped on mobile devices. We propose a physics-based model to understand the nonlinear mechanical response of widgets. This understanding enables us to design tactile force profiles of these widgets so that the resulting accelerometer signals become easy to recognize. We then develop a lightweight signal processing algorithm that analyzes the accelerometer signals and recognizes how the user interacts with the widgets in real time. Vidgets widgets are low-cost, compact, reconfigurable, and power efficient."</em> <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/cg/vidgets/">[...]</a>

Researchers in Rice’s Laboratory for Nanophotonics (LANP) this week showed they could boost the efficiency of their solar-powered desalination system by more than 50% simply by adding inexpensive plastic lenses to concentrate sunlight into “hot spots.” The results are available online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. “The typical way to boost performance in solar-driven systems is to add solar concentrators and bring in more light,” said Pratiksha Dongare, a graduate student in applied physics at Rice’s Brown School of Engineering and co-lead author of the paper. “The big difference here is that we’re using the same amount of light. We’ve shown it’s possible to inexpensively redistribute that power and dramatically increase the rate of purified water production.” In conventional membrane distillation, hot, salty water is flowed across one side of a sheetlike membrane while cool, filtered water flows across the other. The temperature difference creates a difference in vapor pressure that drives water vapor from the heated side through the membrane toward the cooler, lower-pressure side."</em> <a href="https://news.rice.edu/2019/06/17/hot-spots-increase-efficiency-of-solar-desalination/">[...]</a>

In a crystal, the way that the charge and spin of its electrons align and interact underlies these effects.

It's not intended as a recording media, but an instrument to shape the inspiration without distraction (and eventually perform live...). There are plenty of audio recording loop stations out there, both in the form of dedicated hardware (almost every single guitar pedal manufacturer has its own product) or computer software (the excellent Linux Sooper Looper or windows Mobius, to cite the most known). I could only find few projects about DIY non-audio but MIDI loopers, meaning a tool to record MIDI events and play them immediately back in a loop; most of these projects (all of them, I should say) are abandoned or lost ... well, here we are with a complete project for everyone! This Arduino MIDI loop station simply keeps track of incoming MIDI events and play them back. You only have to press the record pedal, create your best riff ever and stop recording by pressing the pedal again."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Multi-track-MIDI-Loop-Station/">[...]</a>

Produced by Scientific Development Corporation in the early 60's it sold for $85.00 (about $720 today). Minivac 601 used electromechanical relays as logic switches as well as for very basic storage. Simple DPDT switches and SPDT push buttons made up the binary inputs, with lights to represent the outputs. A large motorized dial allowed the user to enter decimal or hexadecimal numbers, and to output numbers, or to act as a clock signal generator.

<p><em>"Have you ever wanted to build a LED matrix display using hand-crafting methods, such as sewing, weaving, or papercraft? Designing and fabricating complex LED projects by hand, while making use of limited input-output (i/o) pins on microcontrollers/Arduino, is challenging. Previous posts have covered how to organize LED matrix displays using "Charlieplexing", which simplifies printed circuit board (PCB) assembly and makes efficient use of i/o pins. But, what if we don't want to go through the hassle of ordering a custom PCB, or what if we want to work with individual LEDs in a craft project? Cost is also a factor: a cardstock "papercraft" display could be built from a cheap Arduino-compatible board and bulk LEDs for under $5 on Ebay, far cheaper than even the cheapest LED scrolling marquees. For a brief review, LED multiplexing involves attaching multiple LEDs sharing a common anode (+ side) or cathode (- side) arrangement."</em> <a href="https://crawlingrobotfortress.blogspot.com/2019/02/led-multiplexing-layouts-for-hand.html">[...]</a>
