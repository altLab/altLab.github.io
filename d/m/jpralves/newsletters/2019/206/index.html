<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1798, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonio_Melloni">Macedonio Melloni</a>. Este físico italiano foi o primeiro a estudar extensivamente a radiação infravermelha. Sir William Frederick Herschel descobriu a radiação infravermelha em 1800, mas a pesquisa estagnou até a invenção de uma termo-pilha em 1830. Este instrumento era constituído por uma série de tiras de dois metais diferentes que produziam corrente eléctrica quando uma extremidade era aquecida. Melloni melhorou a termo-pilha e usou-a para detectar radiação infravermelha. Em 1846, de um ponto de observação no alto do Monte Vesúvio, ele mediu o leve efeito de aquecimento do luar. Mostrou também que o sal-gema, sendo transparente ao infravermelho, fazia lentes e prismas adequados para demonstrar a reflexão, a refracção, a polarização e a interferência do infravermelho da mesma maneira que a luz visível.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1908, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masaru_Ibuka">Masaru Ibuka</a>. Este pioneiro da electrónica japonesa foi co-fundador de uma pequena empresa de reparação de rádio do pós-guerra que se transformou na gigante Sony Corporation. Ele mudou a indústria japonesa de produtos electrónicos simplesmente copiando os produtos ocidentais para a inovação com seus próprios produtos electrónicos. Ele introduziu a tecnologia de transístores no Japão. A Sony avançou de fabricar o primeiro rádio transístor japonês para fabricar o primeiro aparelho de televisão transistorizado do mundo. Na década de 1960, Ibuka foi pioneiro na televisão a cores. Aposentou-se da administração em 1976, e voltou-se para pesquisas que desenvolviam produtos como o criativo Walkman e o CD player. As suas realizações foram significativas na construção da confiança do consumidor nos produtos electrónicos japoneses e na reconstrução das economias asiáticas.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1953, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wiles">Andrew Wiles</a>. Este matemático britânico e professor da Royal Society na Universidade de Oxford, especializado em teoria dos números. Ele é mais conhecido por provar o último teorema de Fermat, pelo qual recebeu o Prémio Abel de 2016 [6] e a Medalha Copley 2017 da Royal Society. O Teorema de Fermat (às vezes chamado de conjectura de Fermat, especialmente em textos antigos) afirma que não há três inteiros positivos a, b e c que satisfaçam a equação a^n + b^n = c^n para qualquer valor inteiro de n maior que 2. Os casos n = 1 e n = 2 são conhecidos desde a antiguidade por terem um número infinito de soluções.</p>

<p>No passado dia 7 de Abril fez 50 anos que foi publicado o primeiro RFC. Os chamados "Request for Comments" foram iniciados na Internet ainda 18 anos antes da criação do IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force), mantendo no entanto o seu objectivo de lançar à discussão assuntos e normas pertinentes no âmbito da Internet. Existem actualmente mais de 8500 RFC's, sendo que muitos deles já foram substituídos por outros ainda existem alguns que são referencia nos dias de hoje. O RFC <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918">1918</a> que define as redes IP que devem ser usadas internamente e que não são routeados na Internet é um dos mais conhecidos. Existem mais alguns como o <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322">5322</a> que originalmente era o <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc822">822</a> e que define o funcionamento do SMTP - protocolo de troca de mensagens de correio electrónico ou o <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1945">1954</a> que foi escrito pelo Tim Berners-Lee e que define o funcionamento do protocolo HTTP 1.0. Mas nada como ir à página da <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_RFCs">Wiki</a> que Lista os RFCs entre os quais os mais importantes.</p>

<p>Esta semana que passou foi também noticia a imagem absolutamente incrível do gigante buraco negro que se encontra na galáxia do Messier 87 (M87). A M87 encontra-se a 55 milhões de anos-luz na constelação Virgem, tem aproximadamente o peso de 6.5 mil milhões a massa do Sol. Em Abril de 2017, todos os telescópios do Event Horizon Telescope viraram-se e olharam para a galáxia a 55 milhões de anos-luz de distância chamada M87 e o buraco negro supermassivo no seu núcleo, foi possível ver o que se pensava ser invisível. Foi visto e fotografado um buraco negro. Para obter a imagem foram processados terabytes de informação por supercomputadores na Alemanha e nos Estados Unidos. Foi um trabalho conjunto de cerca de 200 cientistas.</p>

<p>Também hoje foi noticia a falha na aterragem da aeronave Beresheet de Israel que cai na Lua durante a sua tentativa de aterragem. A aeronave robótica Beresheet, construída pela SpaceIL e pela Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), tinha como objectivo tornar-se a primeira nave israelita e a primeira missão financiada por fundos privados a pousar na Lua. Mas o pequeno robô não o conseguiu, despenhando-se contra a superfície da Lua por volta das três horas da tarde. EDT (1925 GMT). O controle da missão perdeu as comunicações com a aeronave quando ela estava cerca de 149 metros acima da superfície da Lua.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. É apresentada a revista newelectronics de 9 de Abril.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/history/fifty-years-of-rfcs/">Fifty Years of RFCs</a></h2>

<p><em>"April 7, 2019 marks the fiftieth anniversary for the RFC Series, which began in April 1969 with the publication of “Host Software” by Steve Crocker. While the Series itself predates the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) by eighteen years, today the IETF is the single largest source of RFCs. It’s an interesting question – did the existence of a growing community that published technical documents like RFCs result in forming the IETF? Further, is the IETF the reason RFCs are still published today? The Series includes documents originating in other ways, including from the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), the Internet Architecture Board (IAB), and contributions via the Independent Submissions stream; they are a small, and important, percentage of the whole. The early RFCs were, in fact, requests for comments on ideas and proposals; the goal was to start conversations rather than to create an archival record of a standard or best practice."</em> <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/history/fifty-years-of-rfcs/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/04/harvard-scientists-lead-team-revealing-black-hole/">Seeing the unseeable</a></h2>

<p><em>"Event Horizon Telescope researchers reveal first-ever image of a black hole A global team of astronomers, led by Harvard scientists, have for the first time captured an image of a black hole. The image, revealed today by researchers from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), shows a bright ring of material surrounding a dark center that marks the event horizon of the black hole — the “point of no return, where nothing, not even light — can escape.” The image is the result of a colossal, years-long effort by dozens of researchers. To find it, the EHT focused on a pair of supermassive black holes — the one at the center of the Milky Way galaxy, known as Sagittarius A* (pronounced Sagittarius A-star), and a second that lies at the heart of an elliptical galaxy called M87. Capturing an image of a black hole, project leaders said, is about more than getting the first glimpse of one of the most curious objects in the cosmos. It also opens the door to allowing astronomers and physicists to test Einstein’s theories of gravity and general relativity under the most extreme conditions in the universe. “A black hole, if you looked at it naked … would be invisible,” said Sheperd Doeleman, director of the EHT."</em> <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/04/harvard-scientists-lead-team-revealing-black-hole/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.space.com/israeli-beresheet-moon-landing-attempt-fails.html">Israel's Beresheet Spacecraft Crashes Into Moon During Landing Attempt</a></h2>

<p><em>"Israel's first moon lander came up just short in its historic touchdown bid this afternoon (April 11). The robotic Beresheet spacecraft, built by SpaceIL and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), aimed to become the first Israeli craft, and the first privately funded mission, ever to land softly on the moon. But the little robot couldn't quite make it, crashing into the gray dirt around 3:25 p.m. EDT (1925 GMT). Mission control lost communications with the spacecraft when it was about 489 feet (149 meters) above the moon's surface. "We had a failure in the spacecraft; we unfortunately have not managed to land successfully," Opher Doron, the general manager of IAI, said during a live broadcast from mission control. "It's a tremendous achievement up 'til now.""</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/israeli-beresheet-moon-landing-attempt-fails.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"It’s a big day for space: launches, tests, orbits and now a distant probe is going to shoot an asteroid with its space gun and make a new crater to play in. It’s Hayabusa 2, Japan’s ambitious and so far highly successful sample return mission to an object called Ryugu. Launched in 2014, Hayabusa 2 has been in the region of Ryugu for several months, carrying out a series of investigations. It has four small landers on board, two of which it dropped off late last year, and which have been hopping happily around the asteroid. In February the craft itself touched down on the surface, stirring up the dust considerably, but nothing like what will happen when they fire a big old bullet into the surface at 4,400 mph using the Small Carry-on Impactor. Here’s a test of the setup firing into a Ryugu-like substrate in a lab here on Earth: Now imagine that happening to an asteroid with very little gravity — the dust and flecks are going to fly all over the place."</em> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/04/japans-hayabusa-2-probe-is-blasting-a-hole-in-an-asteroid-tonight-and-thats-awesome/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Google makes billions from its cloud platform. Now it’s using those billions to buy up the internet itself — or at least the submarine cables that make up the internet backbone. In February, the company announced its intention to move forward with the development of the Curie cable, a new undersea line stretching from California to Chile. It will be the first private intercontinental cable ever built by a major non-telecom company. And if you step back and just look at intracontinental cables, Google has fully financed a number of those already; it was one of the first companies to build a fully private submarine line.

<p><em>"Intel today revealed details about Intel® Optane™ memory H10 with solid-state storage – an innovative device that combines the superior responsiveness of Intel Optane technology with the storage capacity of Intel® Quad Level Cell (QLC) 3D NAND technology in a single space-saver M.2 form factor. “Intel Optane memory H10 with solid-state storage features the unique combination of Intel Optane technology and Intel QLC 3D NAND – exemplifying our disruptive approach to memory and storage that unleashes the full power of Intel-connected platforms in a way no else can provide.” –Rob Crooke, Intel senior vice president and general manager of the Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group Why It’s Important: Combining Intel Optane technology with Intel QLC 3D NAND technology on a single M.2 module enables Intel Optane memory expansion into thin and light notebooks and certain space-constrained desktop form factors – such as all-in-one PCs and mini PCs. The new product also offers a higher level of performance not met by traditional Triple Level Cell (TLC) 3D NAND SSDs today and eliminates the need for a secondary storage device. How It’s Different: Intel’s leadership in computing infrastructure and design allows the company to utilize the value of the platform in its entirety (software, chipset, processor, memory and storage) and deliver that value to the customer. The combination of high-speed acceleration and large SSD storage capacity on a single drive will benefit everyday computer users, whether they use their systems to create, game or work. Compared to a standalone TLC 3D NAND SSD system, Intel Optane memory H10 with solid-state storage enables both faster access to frequently used applications and files and better responsiveness with background activity."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news/intel-optane-technology-intel-qlc-nand-technology-come-together-single-drive/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Lithium batteries are what allow electric vehicles to travel several hundred miles on one charge. Their capacity for energy storage is well known, but so is their tendency to occasionally catch on fire – an occurrence known to battery researchers as “thermal runaway.” These fires occur most frequently when the batteries overheat or cycle rapidly. With more and more electric vehicles on the road each year, battery technology needs to adapt to reduce the likelihood of these dangerous and catastrophic fires. Researchers from the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Engineering report that graphene — wonder material of the 21st century — may take the oxygen out of lithium battery fires. They report their findings in the journal Advanced Functional Materials. The reasons lithium batteries catch fire include rapid cycling or charging and discharging, and high temperatures in the battery."</em> <a href="https://today.uic.edu/graphene-coating-could-help-prevent-lithium-battery-fires">[...]</a>

<p><em>"VCU physics professor Loren Picco, Ph.D., is among a team of researchers that is the first to produce quantities of potentially revolutionary ribbons of phosphorene. Since the isolation of 2-dimensional phosphorene — the phosphorus equivalent of graphene — in 2014, more than 100 theoretical studies have predicted that new and exciting properties could emerge by producing narrow “ribbons” of the material. Now, those ribbons have been made and measured for the first time, and they could revolutionize electronics and fast-charging battery technology. In a new study published in Nature, researchers from University College London, the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom, Virginia Commonwealth University and Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne in Lausanne, Switzerland, describe how they formed quantities of high-quality ribbons of phosphorene from crystals of black phosphorous and lithium ions. One of the study’s co-authors was Loren Picco, Ph.D., associate professor in the Department of Physics in the VCU College of Humanities and Sciences. Picco’s research involves video-rate imaging with high-speed atomic-force microscopy, which enabled the detailed and rapid analysis of ribbons, in collaboration with the University of Bristol."</em> <a href="https://www.news.vcu.edu/article/2D_wonder_materials">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A Canadian quantum computer can solve complex problems more efficiently with an algorithm developed in Japan. Tohoku University researchers have developed an algorithm that enhances the ability of a Canadian-designed quantum computer to more efficiently find the best solution for complicated problems, according to a study published in the journal Scientific Reports. Quantum computing takes advantage of the ability of subatomic particles to exist in more than one state at the same time. It is expected to take modern-day computing to the next level by enabling the processing of more information in less time. The D-Wave quantum annealer, developed by a Canadian company that claims it sells the world's first commercially available quantum computers, employs the concepts of quantum physics to solve 'combinatorial optimization problems.'. A typical example of this sort of problem asks the question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city?""</em> <a href="https://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/press/algorithm_quantum_computing.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Physicists have developed a flexible way to synthesise a wide range of novel nanomaterials with potential applications in areas including optics and sensors. Physicists at the University of Bath have developed a flexible process allowing the synthesis in a single flow of a wide range of novel nanomaterials with various morphologies, with potential applications in areas including optics and sensors. The nanomaterials are formed from Tungsten Disulphide – a Transition Metal Dichalcogenide (TMD) – and can be grown on insulating planar substrates without requiring a catalyst. TMDs are layered materials, and in their two-dimensional form can be considered the inorganic analogues of graphene. The various Tungsten Disulphide morphologies synthesized – two-dimensional sheets growing parallel to the substrate, nanotubes, or a nanomesh resembling a ‘field of blades’ growing outwards from the substrate – are possible due to Dr. Zichen Liu’s PhD research at Bath to split the growth process into two distinct stages. Through this decoupling, the growth process could be routed differently than in more conventional approaches, and be guided to produce all these material morphologies."</em> <a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/announcements/new-tunable-nanomaterials-possible-via-flexible-process-invented-by-university-of-bath-physicists/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Nontraditional route shown to increase performance, burn rate Graphene, a new material with applications in biomedical technology, electronics, composites, energy and sensors, may soon help send rockets to space. A new propellant formulation method to use graphene foams – material used in electronics, optics and energy devices – to power spacecraft is being developed in Purdue University’s Maurice J. Zucrow Laboratories, which is the largest academic propulsion lab in the world. The research is showing success at increasing burn rate of solid propellants that are used to fuel rockets and spacecraft. “Our propulsion and physics researchers came together to focus on a material that has not previously been used in rocket propulsion, and it is demonstrating strong results,” said Li Qiao, an associate professor of aeronautics and astronautics in Purdue’s College of Engineering. The research team, led by Qiao, developed methods of making and using compositions with solid fuel loaded on highly conductive, highly porous graphene foams for enhanced burn rates for the loaded solid fuel.

Fitts Department of Industrial &amp; Systems Engineering. “But one challenge has been organizing the cells that are being printed, so that the engineered tissue more closely mimics natural tissues. “We’ve now developed a technique, called ultrasound-assisted biofabrication (UAB), which allows us to align cells in a three-dimensional matrix during the bioprinting process. This allows us to create a knee meniscus, for example, that is more similar to a patient’s original meniscus. To date, we’ve been able to align cells for a range of engineered musculoskeletal tissues.” To align the cells, the researchers built an ultrasound chamber that allows ultrasonic waves to travel across the area where a bioprinter prints living cells."</em> <a href="https://news.ncsu.edu/2019/04/ultrasound-aligns-living-cells-in-bioprinted-tissues/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This project rewinds the clock all the way back to the mid 1970’s, when electronic video games consisted of nothing more than a few moving black and white pixels, and the home computer was still a vision only shared by garage hackers who were willing to connect all of the ICs by hand and then enter their code using toggle switches, watching the results on nothing more than a few blinking LEDs. Although the immortal 6502 CPU was released in 1975, it did not spawn any of the original home computer greats such as the Commodore PET, Apple II, Atari 8-Bit, VIC-20, C64, BBC, and Acorn until the late 1970’s and early 1980’s. Early video game consoles and arcade games also adopted the affordable 6502 CPU in the late 70’s, the most famous of these being the Atari 2600 Video Game System, released in 1977. Vulcan-74 is a DIY video game system as well as a complete computer, and it will also be powered by a single 6502 processor. The 6502 CPU will be the only processor on the entire board. All of the other ICs will be only 7400 variant logic gates and basic Static RAMs, which were the same types of ICs that were available in the mid-1970s, and used to create all electronic products from arcade games to aerospace navigation systems."</em> <a href="https://www.atomiczombie.com/vulcan-74/">[...]</a>

It is called composite because all information is contained in a single signal. Horizontal synchronization, vertical synchronization, color and luminescence all combined together contrary to VGA where all those signals travels on different wires. So to connect NTSC composite to a TV a simple shielded (coaxial) wire is required with a small RCA phono plug at each end. This project use only 2 actives components a crystal oscillator at 8 times NTSC chroma frequency, which is 3.5795345Mhz and a humble PIC12F1572 MCU in PDIP-8 format.

It's just over 25mm square; about the size of a British 50 pence piece. Introduction The two-digit thermometer is designed so it could be put in a waterproof case outside the window, to show the outside temperature in all weathers. To conserve power the thermometer flashes the temperature every 24 seconds, and then goes to sleep, and it achieves a battery life of about a year with a CR2032 button cell.

BLUE is a low-cost, high-performance robot that is intrinsically safe, developed from the ground up with ever-increasing Artificial Intelligence capabilities in mind. In a paper to be presented at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation in Montreal in May, we describe the key design criteria, trade-offs, and actuation performance for BLUE. Next up for the project is continued stress testing and ramping manufacturing. From there, the goal is to get these affordable robots into as many researchers’ hands as possible.

<h2><a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/ESP32-Capacitive-Touch-Buttons/">ESP32 Capacitive Touch Input Using "Metallic Hole Plugs" for Buttons</a></h2>

<p><em>"As I was finalizing design decisions for an upcoming ESP32 WiFi Kit 32 based project requiring three button input, one noticeable problem was that the WiFi Kit 32 does not possess a single mechanical pushbutton, yet alone three mechanical buttons, for input. However, the WiFi Kit 32 does have plenty of capacitive touch inputs, so I spent some time assembling hardware, writing software and testing a three button input design utilizing the ESP32 capacitive touch input feature and three 3/8" "metallic hole plugs" for buttons. As anyone who has experimented with the ESP32 capacitive touch inputs has discovered, the touch inputs are most certainly noisy enough to require filtering for reliable input detection. To minimize the total parts count for the upcoming project, I determined that a simple interrupt driven digital filter (more of a "debounce" than a filter, but I digress), as opposed to adding external filter hardware, could quiet down the noisy inputs. And after testing, it became apparent that the ESP32 capacitive inputs, three 3/8" metallic hole plugs, and some digital "filtering" software, would indeed provide a reliable three button input for the design. So if you are interested in testing capacitive input with digital filtering on an ESP32, I've included the source code "Buttons.ino" in the Arduino environment format along with assembly and programming instructions, plus a brief description of the source code, for what I discovered to be a highly reliable three button input."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/ESP32-Capacitive-Touch-Buttons/">[...]</a>
