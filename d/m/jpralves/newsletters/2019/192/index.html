<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1823, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Whitehead">Robert Whitehead</a>. Este engenheiro britânico foi responsável pela invenção do torpedo moderno. O seu primeiro torpedo não tinha velocidade nem alcance. No entanto, em 1870 ele conseguiu aumentar a sua velocidade para 7 nós e agora conseguia atingir um alvo a cerca de 600 metros de distância. No ano seguinte, a marinha britânica comprou a invenção de Whitehead. Embora um torpedo de mastro, uma carga ligada a um longo mastro e carregado por um pequeno barco, tivesse sido usado durante a Guerra Civil Americana, Robert Whitehead foi o primeiro a produzir um torpedo auto-propulsionado. O torpedo de Whitehead era impulsionado por um motor de ar comprimido, carregado com 8 quilos de dinamite. A sua característica mais importante era um dispositivo auto-regulador que mantinha o torpedo a uma profundidade predefinida constante. Edison fez um filme de um lançamento de torpedo de Whitehead (1900).</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1906, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wilson_Morgan">William Wilson Morgan</a>. Este astrônomo norte-americano, em 1951, forneceu a primeira evidência de que a galáxia da Via Láctea possui braços espirais. Ele passou toda a sua carreira no Observatório Yerkes, incluindo três anos como diretor. Evitando a teoria, sua pesquisa foi dedicada à morfologia, a classificação dos objetos por sua forma e estrutura. Com Keenan e Kellman, ele introduziu classes de luminosidade estelar e a classificação bidimensional de espectros estelares estritamente baseada nos próprios espectros. Com Osterbrock e Sharpless, ele demonstrou a existência de braços espirais na Galáxia usando distâncias precisas de estrelas O e B obtidas a partir de classificações espectrais. Morgan inventou o sistema UBV de magnitudes e cores.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1929, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Moore">Gordon Moore</a>. Este engenheiro norte-americano ficou conhecido por ser co-fundador e presidente da Intel. Tendo começado a sua carreira na Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory passou pela Fairchild Semiconductor Laboratory e por fim, em 1968 fundou com Robert Noyce a NM Electronics que mais tarde se chamaria de Intel Corporation. Foi ele que enunciou num paper que publicou a famosa Lei de Moore. Esta definia que o número de transístores dos chips teria um aumento de 100%, pelo mesmo custo, a cada período de 18 meses. Como o custo do computador para o consumidor cai, o custo para os produtores cumprirem a lei de Moore segue uma tendência oposta: os custos de R &amp; D, manufatura e teste aumentaram de forma constante com cada nova geração de chips. O aumento dos custos de fabricação é uma consideração importante para a sustentação da lei de Moore. Isto levou à formulação da segunda lei de Moore, também chamada de lei de Rock, segundo a qual o custo de capital de uma fábrica de semicondutores também aumenta exponencialmente ao longo do tempo.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou a NASA informou que às 14h43 EST em 31 de dezembro, enquanto muitos na Terra se preparavam para receber o Ano Novo, a nave espacial OSIRIS-REx da NASA, a 110 milhões de quilómetros de distância, realizou uma queima de oito segundos de seus propulsores - e bateu um recorde da exploração espacial. A nave entrou em órbita ao redor do asteroide Bennu e transformou Bennu no menor objeto a ser orbitado por uma nave. O grande objectivo desta missão é recolher amostras do asteroide e trazê-las para a Terra.</p>

<p>Esta quinta-feira a China tornou-se no primeiro país a aterrar uma sonda no lado mais afastado da Lua, a Chang’e-4, informou a televisão estatal. A sonda com o nome da deusa chinesa da Lua, pousou no satélite natural da Terra, na cratera Von Kármán às 03:26 de Lisboa. A sonda permanecerá estacionária na superfície em uma região conhecida como bacia do Pólo Sul – Aitken. No entanto, ela também carrega um rover de seis rodas que os cientistas chineses usarão para explorar o outro lado da lua. O rover mede 1 metro de diâmetro e pesa 140 kg, significativamente menor do que o Curiosity da NASA, baseado em Marte. O tempo de vida esperado do projeto é de três meses, e o objetivo é verificar o crescimento de plantas e captar sinais de radiofrequência, normalmente bloqueados pela atmosfera terrestre.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como alguns modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis.</p>

<p><em>"At 2:43 p.m. EST on December 31, while many on Earth prepared to welcome the New Year, NASA’s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, 70 million miles (110 million kilometers) away, carried out a single, eight-second burn of its thrusters – and broke a space exploration record. The spacecraft entered into orbit around the asteroid Bennu, and made Bennu the smallest object ever to be orbited by a spacecraft. “The team continued our long string of successes by executing the orbit-insertion maneuver perfectly,” said Dante Lauretta, OSIRIS-REx principal investigator at the University of Arizona, Tucson. “With the navigation campaign coming to an end, we are looking forward to the scientific mapping and sample site selection phase of the mission.” Lauretta, along with his team, spent the last day of 2018 with his feet planted on Earth, but his mind focused on space. “Entering orbit around Bennu is an amazing accomplishment that our team has been planning for years,” Lauretta said. Inching around the asteroid at a snail’s pace, OSIRIS-REx’s first orbit marks a leap for humankind."</em> <a href="https://www.asteroidmission.org/?latest-news=nasas-osiris-rex-spacecraft-enters-close-orbit-around-bennu-breaking-record">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scientists at last have their first good look at a primordial piece of the solar system orbiting more than four billion miles away. On the final evening of 2018, the biggest New Year's Eve party in the solar system unfolded across four billion miles of space. At 12:33 a.m. ET on January 1, NASA's New Horizons probe flew by a small lump of rock and ice called 2014 MU69. Also nicknamed Ultima Thule (UL-tee-ma TOO-le), it's now the most distant, and most primitive, place ever visited by humans. Due to the vast distance messages must travel between Earth and the spacecraft, members of the New Horizons team didn't immediately know for sure whether the flyby was successful."</em> <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2019/01/nasa-completes-farthest-ever-flyby-ultima-thule-what-happens-next/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF), the support organization for the advancement and adoption of USB technology, today announced the launch of its USB Type-C™ Authentication Program, marking an important milestone for the optional USB security protocol. The USB Type-C Authentication specification defines cryptographic-based authentication for USB Type-C chargers and devices. USB Type-C Authentication empowers host systems to protect against non-compliant USB chargers and to mitigate risks from malicious firmware/hardware in USB devices attempting to exploit a USB connection. Using this protocol, host systems can confirm the authenticity of a USB device, USB cable or USB charger, including such product aspects as the capabilities and certification status. All of this happens right at the moment a connection is made – before inappropriate power or data can be transferred. “USB-IF is excited to launch the USB Type-C Authentication Program, providing OEMs with the flexibility to implement a security framework that best fits their specific product requirements,” said USB-IF President and COO Jeff Ravencraft."</em> <a href="https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/2019-01/USB-IF_USB%20Type-C%20Authentication%20Program%20Press%20Release_FINAL_20181227.pdf">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Rolls-Royce is leading a highly specialised challenge to build the world’s fastest all-electric aircraft This zero-emissions plane is expected to make a run for the record books with a target speed of 300+ MPH (480+ KMH). Inside a bustling hangar bay at the far end of Gloucestershire airport in South West England, a team of British engineers, designers, and data specialists recruited from across Rolls-Royce and beyond have set out to make history. They’re building a high-performance electric aeroplane unlike anything the world has ever seen. Scheduled to take to the skies over Great Britain in 2020, the aircraft will reach a speed of 300 mph – and quite likely more – making it the fastest all-electric plane in history. This run for the record books is no stunt. It’s part of a Rolls-Royce initiative called ACCEL – short for “Accelerating the Electrification of Flight” – that’s intended to pioneer a third wave of aviation in support of Rolls-Royce’s strategy to champion electrification."</em> <a href="https://www.rolls-royce.com/media/our-stories/innovation/2018/introducing-accel.aspx">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.riotinto.com/media/media-releases-237_26594.aspx">World-first autonomous trains deployed at Rio Tinto's iron ore operations</a></h2>

<p><em>"Rio Tinto has successfully deployed AutoHaul™, establishing the world’s largest robot and first automated heavy-haul, long distance rail network. Since completing the first loaded run in July, Rio Tinto has steadily increased the number of autonomous journeys across its world-class iron ore operations in Western Australia in a controlled and safe manner, with over 1 million kilometres now travelled autonomously. Rio Tinto Iron Ore managing director Rail, Port &amp; Core Services Ivan Vella said “The safe and successful deployment of AutoHaul™ across our network is a strong reflection of the pioneering spirit inside Rio Tinto. It’s been a challenging journey to automate a rail network of this size and scale in a remote location like the Pilbara, but early results indicate significant potential to improve productivity, providing increased system flexibility and reducing bottlenecks.” Over the coming months we will continue to refine our autonomous operations to ensure we are able to maximise value. We continue to work closely with drivers during this period and do not expect to make any redundancies in 2019 as a result of the deployment of AutoHaul™. Notes to editors The $940 million AutoHaul™ programme is focused on automating trains transporting iron ore to Rio Tinto’s port facilities in the Pilbara region of Western Australia."</em> <a href="https://www.riotinto.com/media/media-releases-237_26594.aspx">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.arm.com/company/news/2019/01/a-sharper-digital-eye-for-intelligent-devices">A sharper digital eye for intelligent devices with the latest Arm ISP technology</a></h2>

<p><em>"New Arm Mali-C52 and Mali-C32 image signal processors (ISPs) provide class-leading image quality, a complete software package, and full set of calibration and tuning tools Higher image quality in a wide range of everyday devices including drones, smart home assistants and security, and internet protocol (IP) cameras New applications can now take advantage of the unique capabilities of Arm Iridix technology, proven in more than two billion devices today Of all our five senses, sight is the most evolved and richest sense, and for decades the digital world has strived to exceed our own visual processing capabilities which are enabled by 2 million-plus nerve fibers from the retinas into the brain. Creating “digital eyes” for processing real-time higher-quality images to give viewers the truest sense of an environment is among the many challenges faced by the Arm ecosystem, which is working towards enabling a trillion connected devices. In fact, according to our estimates, demand for IoT devices with embedded vision capabilities are among the highest across connected devices: The security (surveillance) and IP camera market is on pace for an annual growth rate of 20% through to 2021 reaching over 500 million shipped units; Personal robots are growing at a staggering 75% y-o-y rate and are expected to reach 2 million units shipped in 2021; The smart home market is growing at 14% y-o-y to 88 million in 2021, and other devices like drones, augmented reality (AR)/ mixed reality (MR) equipment and action cameras are shifting from emerging to widely adopted in terms of market category In response to the demand for real-time higher image quality in those devices, today Arm is announcing a new generation of image signal processors (ISPs), the Arm Mali-C52 and Mali-C32 ISPs. Translating perception into pixels A critical aspect of image technology used in the aforementioned devices is the ISP technology embedded within each of them. In these constrained devices, the key function of an ISP is to deliver the most accurate and highest image quality when pulling data from an image sensor and processing each pixel, particularly where machine learning is involved. The new Arm Mali-C52 and Mali-C32 apply over twenty-five processing steps to each pixel, of which three critical ones deliver key differentiation in terms of image output quality."</em> <a href="https://www.arm.com/company/news/2019/01/a-sharper-digital-eye-for-intelligent-devices">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Spin-based quantum computers have the potential to tackle difficult mathematical problems that cannot be solved using ordinary computers, but many problems remain in making these machines scalable. Now, an international group of researchers led by the RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science have crafted a new architecture for quantum computing. By constructing a hybrid device made from two different types of qubit—the fundamental computing element of quantum computers—they have created a device that can be quickly initialized and read out, and that simultaneously maintains high control fidelity. In an era where conventional computers appear to be reaching a limit, quantum computers—which do calculations using quantum phenomena—have been touted as potential replacements, and they can tackle problems in a very different and potentially much more rapid way. However, it has proven difficult to scale them up to the size required for performing real-world calculations. In 1998, Daniel Loss, one of the authors of the current study, came up with a proposal, along with David DiVincenzo of IBM, to build a quantum computer by using the spins of electrons embedded in a quantum dot—a small particle that behaves like an atom, but that can be manipulated, so that they are sometimes called “artificial atoms.” In the time since then, Loss and his team have endeavored to build practical devices."</em> <a href="http://www.riken.jp/en/pr/press/2018/20181228_2/">[...]</a>

Anurag Agarwal Using ultra-high-speed cameras and modern audio capture techniques, the researchers, from the University of Cambridge, found that the ‘plink, plink’ sound produced by a water droplet hitting a liquid surface is caused not by the droplet itself, but by the oscillation of a small bubble of air trapped beneath the water’s surface. The bubble forces the water surface itself to vibrate, acting like a piston to drive the airborne sound. In addition, the researchers found that changing the surface tension of the surface, for example by adding washing-up liquid, can stop the sound."</em> <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/what-causes-the-sound-of-a-dripping-tap-and-how-do-you-stop-it">[...]</a>

Nearly all commercial products start as a CAD file, a 2-D or 3-D model with the product’s design specifications. One method that’s widely used to represent today’s 3-D models is constructive solid geometry (CSG), a technique where numerous basic shapes, or “primitives,” with a few adjustable parameters can be assembled in various ways to form a single object. When finalized, the compiled digital object is converted to a mesh of 3-D triangles that defines the object’s shape. These meshes are used as input for many applications, including 3-D printing and virtual simulation."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/customizing-3-d-computer-aided-design-0103">[...]</a>

The library implements a resolution of 512 x 480 pixels, stored in a framebuffer inside the RAM, which requires 30720 bytes. The resolution is huge in comparison to the Arduino TVout or VGAx ones (128 x 96 and 120 x 60 pixels respectively).

<p><em>"The iLumos range of smart light switch and dimmers work very nicely. They install easily into UK as they don't require a neutral connection which is often not present in UK lighting switch points. They use 433MHz transmissions from their remote controls as well as having the touch sensitive controls on their face plate. If one wants to control them from an App or to use voice control like Alexa then the recommended method is to use a Broadlink RM controller which can transmit either IR or 433MHz rf messages. As the protocol is not built in then one has to train the Broadlink product to learn the remote control signals. It is difficult to do this training and even when apparently successful it does not produce a reliable result."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/ILumos-Remote-Control/">[...]</a>

This project is comprised of two main parts, the physical vehicle and the user controls. The physical vehicle consists of two rear wheels on the chassis which are controlled by a single motor, and the front wheel is controlled by a servo. The rear wheels serve to control forwards and backwards motion while the front wheel enables the user to move side to side. Attached to the top of the chassis is the slave mode bluetooth module, which will receive the hand orientation data from the accelerometer, and transmits to the PIC32 board will output the appropriate movement commands."</em> <a href="http://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/FinalProjects/f2018/lst26_ak754/4760_Final/4760%20Final%20Project%20Write%20Up_1/4760FinalProjectWriteUp.html">[...]</a>

But nothing is better than designing your own DIY sensors to work with a wide range of micro-controllers so you have the exact design you need for your project. This instructable will be a part of a series of Instructables in which I show you how to build sensors compatible with the most microcontroller you can find. In the last two Instructables, I showed you how to how to make a Tilt sensor, Vibration sensor and how to make a Touch sensor. In this instructable, I'm going to show you How to design your own light sensor, which could be used as a day and night switch or as a part of a security system.
