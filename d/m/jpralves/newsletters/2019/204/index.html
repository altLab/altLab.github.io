<p>Faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1819, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Bazalgette">Joseph Bazalgette</a>. Este engenheiro civil britânico projectou o sistema de drenagem principal para Londres. Como engenheiro, ele construiu algumas pontes importantes em Londres, mas sua maior realização foi resolver um problema crescente com a poluição por esgoto no rio Tamisa. Em meados do século XIX, tantos londrinos estavam a usar as novas sanitas que o rio estava extremamente poluído com esgoto. A crise do "Grande Fedor" intensificou-se com os surtos de cólera. Bazalgette foi escolhido para projetar e construir o sistema de esgotos de Londres, um projecto de 20 anos. Algumas das suas ideias ainda influenciam a engenharia urbana hoje.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1897, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Mills">Victor Mills</a>. Este engenheiro químico americano  inventou as fraldas descartáveis. Juntou-se à Proctor &amp; Gamble em 1926, e logo a seguir desenvolveu um processo contínuo para super-aquecer o sabão líquido e pulverizá-lo em forma concentrada através de uma extrusora que produz barras de sabão Ivory. Isto reduziu o tempo de produção de sete dias para apenas algumas horas. Ele melhorou as misturas para bolos da Duncan Hines, passando ingredientes através de grandes tambores de moagem projectados para polir a folha de alumínio, mas tornando o bolo acabado menos encaroçado. Ele desenvolveu um processo para impedir que o óleo se separasse na manteiga de amendoim. A sua invenção de fraldas descartáveis como produto foi criada para utilizar o papel absorvente limpo disponível numa fábrica de celulose adquirida pela empresa.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1930, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Isaac_Friedman">Jerome Isaac Friedman</a>. Este Físico americano, junto com Richard E. Taylor e Henry W. Kendall, recebeu o Prémio Nobel de Física em 1990 pela sua confirmação experimental conjunta das partículas fundamentais conhecidas como quarks.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1939, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dov_Frohman">Dov Frohman</a>. Este engenheiro electrotécnico israelita ficou conhecido por ter inventado a memória leitura programável apagável (EPROM) e também por ser o fundador e primeiro gestor da Intel Israel.</p>

<p>Esta semana ficámos a saber que a sonda Cassini descobriu factos curiosos sobre as cinco pequenas luas que orbitam o planeta Saturno. As superfícies dessas luas estão cobertas com material dos anéis do planeta - e de partículas geladas que saiem disparadas da lua maior de Saturno, Enceladus. O trabalho agora apresentado pinta uma imagem dos processos concorrentes que moldam estas mini-luas.</p>

<p>Esta semana que passou ficámos igualmente a saber que a maior impressora 3D do mundo está a chegar à Arábia Saudita em 2019. Desenvolvida pela empresa dinamarquesa Cobod a impressora pode produzir edifícios de 12x27x9m, bem como estruturas de três andares de 300m2 por andar.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou o altLab conjuntamente com alguns membros externos esteve a participar na Hackaton do Pixels Camp 3.0. Foram atingidos os objectivos a que nos comprometemos com o projecto "Open SLAndroid Pixie". Este projecto assenta na construção de uma impressora de Resina (Do tipo SLA) que recorre ao ecrã de um telemóvel obsoleto para apresentar as camadas que têm que ser curadas. Todo o processo é controlado por uma aplicação web que se encontra a correr no próprio telemóvel e que controla a parte mecânica da impressora controlando um Arduino por Bluetooth. Um agradecimento ao esforço dedicação de todos, nomeadamente ao Vinicius, ao João Silva, ao Gustavo, ao Ricardo e ao Rodrigo.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como um modelo 3D que poderá ser útil. São apresentados os livros Inside Azure Management e o "Book of Making volume 1" assim como as revistas MagPI nº 80, newlectronics de 12 e 26 de Março.</p>

<p><em>"New findings have emerged about five tiny moons nestled in and near Saturn's rings. The closest-ever flybys by NASA's Cassini spacecraft reveal that the surfaces of these unusual moons are covered with material from the planet's rings - and from icy particles blasting out of Saturn's larger moon Enceladus. The work paints a picture of the competing processes shaping these mini-moons. "The daring, close flybys of these odd little moons let us peer into how they interact with Saturn's rings," said Bonnie Buratti of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Buratti led a team of 35 co-authors that published their work in the journal Science on March 28. "We're seeing more evidence of how extremely active and dynamic the Saturn ring and moon system is.""</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7360">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Danish firm Cobod to deliver Bod 2 printer to Saudi Arabian builder Elite for Construction &amp; Development Co in Q2 2019 Saudi Arabia's Elite for Construction &amp; Development Company has purchased what has been described as the world’s largest 3D construction printer from Danish firm Cobod International. The Bod 2 printer can produce buildings of 12x27x9m buildings, as well as three-storey structures of 300m2 per floor. Cobod said in a statement that its printer will be delivered in Saudi Arabia by the end of May, adding that the machine will be the "first of its kind" in the kingdom. Copenhagen-based Codod, a sister company of 3D Printhuset, manufactured Europe’s first 3D printed building in Europe, the Bod, in 2017. A year later saw it launch Bod 2. In 2018, Germany's Peri Group acquired a minority stake in Cobod."</em> <a href="https://www.constructionweekonline.com/products-services/170002-the-worlds-largest-3d-printer-is-coming-to-saudi-arabia-in-2019">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Arm recognizes how security and efficiency are key concerns for developers creating IoT devices, which is why Arm’s latest release of Mbed OS, Mbed OS 5.12, ushers in Platform Security Architecture (PSA) support. This latest addition builds upon previous advances, such as Mbed TLS and Pelion Device Management by incorporating the industry standard for practical, accessible device life cycle security. Other features include: Platform Security Architecture (PSA) Additional security and partitioning offer greater resilience without adding complexity or the need to amend a single line of code. Plus, it can run on any processor with the same APIs because PSA is not architecture specific. PSA cryptography Main firmware developers can now carry out cryptographic operations behind the security wall without having to deal with cryptographic key material directly. PSA delineates cryptography API between end users and a lower level device driver API, meaning developers can augment crypto algorithms without having to modify the API itself."</em> <a href="https://os.mbed.com/blog/entry/arm-mbed-os-512-release/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Faradair®, has revealed its intention to certify its revolutionary 18 seat, hybrid electric ‘BEHA’ aircraft (Bio Electric Hybrid Aircraft) by 2025 for passenger operations. Designated the BEHA_M1H, this hybrid powered aircraft utilises a design patented ‘Triple Box-wing’ high-lift configuration, delivering Short Take-Off and Landing (STOL) capability requiring less than 300 meters of runway. With twin contra-rotating ‘propfans’ within a vectored thrust, acoustic reduction duct that improves efficiency and reduces noise to a target of just 60dba at take-off. After four years of development, both simulated and scale model testing, the design has evolved into a utilitarian configuration, capable of carrying 18 passengers or three LD3 cargo containers, with an internal payload capability of FIVE TONNES. The aircraft will be able to change configuration in 15 minutes from cargo to passenger and vice versa and the company is already in discussion with potential civilian and non-civilian customers for this class leading capability. London to Manchester could be flown in just 42 minutes at a cruise speed of 230mph (HS2 would take 1hour and 8 minutes by comparison) As one of the earliest hybrid electric aerospace start-up’s founded in 2014, UK based Faradair® has had to survive on angel investment funding and partner input in order to develop its new aircraft design."</em> <a href="https://www.suasnews.com/2019/03/faradair-announces-hybrid-electric-commercial-flight-capability-from-2025/">[...]</a>

Rutgers University–New Brunswick engineers have created flexible, lightweight materials with 4D printing that could lead to better shock absorption, morphing airplane or drone wings, soft robotics and tiny implantable biomedical devices. Their research is published in the journal Materials Horizons. 3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, turns digital blueprints to physical objects by building them layer by layer. 4D printing is based on this technology, with one big difference: it uses special materials and sophisticated designs to print objects that change shape with environmental conditions such as temperature acting as a trigger, said senior author Howon Lee, an assistant professor in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. Time is the fourth dimension that allows them to morph into a new shape."</em> <a href="https://news.rutgers.edu/4d-printed-materials-can-be-stiff-wood-or-soft-sponge/20190321">[...]</a>

A new system devised by researchers at MIT can monitor the behavior of all electric devices within a building, ship, or factory, determining which ones are in use at any given time and whether any are showing signs of an imminent failure. When tested on a Coast Guard cutter, the system pinpointed a motor with burnt-out wiring that could have led to a serious onboard fire. The new sensor, whose readings can be monitored on an easy-to-use graphic display called a NILM (non-intrusive load monitoring) dashboard, is described in the March issue of IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, in a paper by MIT professor of electrical engineering Steven Leeb, recent graduate Andre Aboulian MS ’18, and seven others at MIT, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the U.S. Naval Academy.

<h2><a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2019/03/hydrogel">Dynamic hydrogel used to make 'soft robot' components and LEGO-like building blocks</a></h2>

<p><em>"A new type of hydrogel material developed by Brown University researchers could soon make assembling complex microfluidic or soft robotic devices as simple as putting together a LEGO set. Using a new type of dual polymer material capable of responding dynamically to its environment, Brown University researchers have developed a set of modular hydrogel components that could be useful in a variety of “soft robotic” and biomedical applications. The components, which are patterned by a 3D printer, are capable of bending, twisting or sticking together in response to treatment with certain chemicals. For a paper published in the journal Polymer Chemistry, the researchers demonstrated a soft gripper capable of actuating on demand to pick up small objects. They also designed LEGO-like hydrogel building blocks that can be carefully assembled then tightly sealed together to form customized microfluidic devices — “lab-on-a-chip” systems used for drug screening, cell cultures and other applications. The key to the new material’s functionality is its dual polymer composition, the researchers say."</em> <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2019/03/hydrogel">[...]</a>

The system is analogous to a computer, but instead of using transistors and diodes, it uses molecules to represent a six-bit binary number (for example, 011001). The team developed a variety of algorithms that can be computed by the molecules.

<h2><a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/convolutional-neural-network-automation-0321">Kicking neural network design automation into high gear</a></h2>

<p><em>"Algorithm designs optimized machine-learning models up to 200 times faster than traditional methods. A new area in artificial intelligence involves using algorithms to automatically design machine-learning systems known as neural networks, which are more accurate and efficient than those developed by human engineers. But this so-called neural architecture search (NAS) technique is computationally expensive. A state-of-the-art NAS algorithm recently developed by Google to run on a squad of graphical processing units (GPUs) took 48,000 GPU hours to produce a single convolutional neural network, which is used for image classification and detection tasks. Google has the wherewithal to run hundreds of GPUs and other specialized hardware in parallel, but that’s out of reach for many others. In a paper being presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations in May, MIT researchers describe an NAS algorithm that can directly learn specialized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for target hardware platforms — when run on a massive image dataset — in only 200 GPU hours, which could enable far broader use of these types of algorithms."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/convolutional-neural-network-automation-0321">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers at the Center for Free-Electron Laser Science (CFEL) have generated a 1.9-femtosecond ultraviolet laser light pulse – setting arecord for ultraviolet (UV) laser pulses with the shortest duration. The experiments, published in the recent issue of the scientific journal Optics Letters, outshine the previous record of 2.8 femtoseconds, set in 2010. The 1.9-femtosecond pulse (1 femtosecond is a millionth of a billionth of a second) has been generated in the laboratory of Prof. Francesca Calegari (Universität Hamburg, DESY) head of the attosecond science group at CFEL and member of the cluster of excellence CUI: Advanced Imaging of Matter. It covers the very relevant spectral region between 210 and 340 nanometres (nm), corresponding to the so-called UVB and UVC energy ranges. UVB radiation contained in the solar emission partially penetrates our atmosphere, thus triggering a number of bio-chemically relevant processes including damage of the DNA, leading to skin cancer. These processes are often based on ultrafast mechanisms that require extremely short light pulses to be captured in real time."</em> <a href="https://www.cui.uni-hamburg.de/en/2019/03/researchers-generate-the-shortest-ultraviolet-laser-pulse-ever/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A battery prototype has been designed using salt water and materials that are non-toxic and charge quickly, paving the way for new types of battery. The design principles behind the new prototype, which changes colour as it charges, could also be applied to existing battery technologies to create new devices for energy storage, biological sensing, and smart colour-changing materials. The most widely used batteries currently are lithium-ion batteries, which have a relatively high capacity (they hold a large amount of charge) but do not discharge or recharge their energy quickly. They also contain organic electrolytes and other materials that can be hazardous and flammable, meaning they require careful handling and disposal. The new battery prototype, developed by a team of researchers from the departments of Physics and Chemistry at Imperial College London, uses thin films of specially designed plastics and simple salt water instead. While it can hold less charge than conventional lithium-ion batteries, the prototype, which is made from polymers – long chains of molecules that make up plastics – can charge and discharge in a matter of seconds."</em> <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/190596/non-toxic-salt-water-battery-prototype-charge/">[...]</a>

The technology has many possible applications for healthcare, energy and the military. But there are several challenges involved in finding suitable materials and manufacturing methods. The biggest challenge for making stretchable electronics is that each component must endure being compressed, twisted and applied to uneven surfaces while maintaining performance, according to the review author Wei Wu, materials scientist at Wuhan University, China.

Organic semiconductors have not been realistic candidates for spintronics so far because it was impossible to move spins far enough without losing the original information Deepak Venkateshvaran The international team from the UK, Germany and the Czech Republic, have found that these materials could be used for ‘spintronic’ applications, which could make cheap organic semiconductors competitive with silicon for future computing applications. The results are reported in the journal Nature Electronics. ‘Spin’ is the term for the intrinsic angular momentum of electrons, which is referred to as up or down.

Hulet’s lab conducted the study’s experiments using lithium BECs, tiny clouds of ultracold atoms that march in lockstep as if they are a single entity, or matter wave. “The relationship between these states can teach us a great deal about complex quantum many-body phenomena.” The research was conducted in collaboration with physicists at Austria’s Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien) and Brazil’s University of São Paulo at São Carlos. The experiments harken to Michael Faraday‘s 1831 discovery that patterns of ripples were created on the surface of a fluid in a bucket that was shaken vertically at certain critical frequencies. The patterns, known as Faraday waves, are similar to resonant modes created on drumheads and vibrating plates. To investigate Faraday waves, the team confined BECs to a linear one-dimensional waveguide, resulting in a cigar-shaped BEC."</em> <a href="http://news.rice.edu/2019/03/25/matter-waves-and-quantum-splinters-2/">[...]</a>

Even at the extreme cold temperatures of a dilution refrigerator where the quantum processors operate, our physical computing elements, superconducting qubits, have coherence times on the order of a few hundred microseconds at best, which sets the timescales over which quantum information is lost.

When subject to the laws of quantum mechanics, systems made of many interacting particles can display behaviour so complex that its quantitative description defies the capabilities of the most powerful computers in the world.

The CNC machine, for which the dispensing head is currently developed, is a FABtotum multipurpose device (https://opentotum.github.io/fabtotum.com-backup/): CAD files for dispensing head come from a remix of TwinTeeth's dispensing head (http://www.diyouware.com/node/174), adapted onFABtotum carriage.A remix of CAM software rpt2pnp (https://github.com/hzeller/rpt2pnp) was adapted to fit the needs of FABtotum supported gcode commands.The PCB on which tests were made is an FTDI circuit (http://archive.fabacademy.org/2016/fablabsingapore/students/98/exercise06.html) designed with KiCAD (1206 Imperial).The PCB is milled with FABtotum using FlatCAM. An 20G 0.6mm ID 1.5'' dispensing needle is used to dispense diluted solder paste with IPA. "</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Solder-Paste-Dispensing-Head/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Translate music to a dazzling light show with this customizable light controller project. Great for DJs, parties, and 1:1 shows! The idea behind this project was to create a controller to allows users to “play” light like it is an instrument with custom visuals, gesture control, and brightness/speed dials. Considering how pricey consumer light controllers can be (often $100 bucks or more- not including the lights!) we decided to try to make a cheaper, more customizable solution!
