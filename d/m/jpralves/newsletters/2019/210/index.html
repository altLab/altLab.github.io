<p>Foi no longínquo dia 5 de Maio de 2015 que esta aventura começou... e já se passaram 4 anos. A newsletter do altLab está de parabéns. Tem sido uma jornada interessante e que tem trazido a este espaço um conjunto muito interessante de informação seja ela de cariz Cientifico/Tecnológico ou projectos curiosos que estão publicados na Internet, passando pelos e-books ou e-magazines que estão disponíveis gratuitamente para todos. Para já o formato da newsletter irá manter-se. Haverá algumas mudanças que futuramente revelarei.</p>

<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1746, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaspard_Monge">Gaspard Monge</a>. Este Matemático francês ficou conhecido pela sua elaboração da geometria descritiva. Embora fosse filho de um comerciante ambulante, aos 22 anos de idade, leccionava matemática na escola militar de Mézières e mais tarde tornou-se professor na École Polytechnique, que ajudou a fundar e a organizar. Ele desenvolveu a matemática de projectar figuras sólidas num plano (sobre o qual se baseia o desenho de engenharia moderno) seguindo uma sugestão da teoria (1738) de Frézier. Monge aplicou mais técnicas de análise à teoria da curvatura que mais tarde foi retomada no trabalho revolucionário de Georg Riemann sobre geometria e curvatura.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1845, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustaf_de_Laval">Gustaf de Laval</a>. Este cientista, engenheiro e inventor sueco foi pioneiro no desenvolvimento de turbinas de alta velocidade. Depois de ganhar o seu Ph.D. aos 27 anos, ele trabalhou como engenheiro técnico numa siderurgia na sua terra natal. Em 1877, ele começou a desenvolver um separador de creme centrífugo de alta velocidade, um avanço significativo na produção de manteiga. Ele aperfeiçoou uma máquina de ordenha a vácuo em 1913. Por volta de 1882, começou a trabalhar em turbinas a vapor e, em 1889, solicitou uma patente britânica para um tipo de impulso, com um jacto de vapor batendo num conjunto de lâminas na periferia de uma roda. O seu talento inventivo era amplo,  e incluiu iluminação eléctrica, eletrometalurgia e aerodinâmica. Durante a sua vida, ele adquiriu 92 patentes suecas e fundou 37 empresas.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1850, [Edward Weston](Edward Weston (chemist)). Este Engenheiro electrotécnico e industrial americano nascido na Grã-Bretanha fundou a Weston Electrical Instrument Company. Ele foi para a América como um jovem estudante de medicina em 1870. Nos anos seguintes, ele revolucionou a indústria de electro-galvanização inventando e fabricando um dínamo de galvanoplastia com muito sucesso, que superou em muito a eficiência das baterias de armazenamento. Ele patenteou o dínamo e um ânodo de níquel em 1875. A partir de então até cerca de 1917, Weston recebeu 334 patentes nos EUA. Após as primeiras experiências com projectos de lâmpadas incandescentes, ele destacou-se com a invenção e fabricação de uma série de instrumentos de medição electrónica de precisão.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1927, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfred_Eigen">Manfred Eigen</a>. Este Físico e bioquímico alemão partilhou (com Ronald Norrish e George Porter) o Prémio Nobel de 1967 da Química “pelos seus estudos de reacções químicas extremamente rápidas, afectando o equilíbrio por meio de pulsos de energia muito curtos.” Em 1954, Eigen introduziu as técnicas de relaxamento para o estudo de reacções químicas extremamente rápidas (aquelas que levam menos de um milissegundo). O seu método geral era tomar uma solução em equilíbrio para uma dada temperatura e pressão. Se uma pequena perturbação fosse aplicada à solução, o equilíbrio seria muito brevemente destruído e um novo equilíbrio seria rapidamente alcançado. Eigen estudou exactamente o que aconteceu neste curto espaço de tempo por meio de espectroscopia de absorção.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que a Blue Origin planeia levar humanos à Lua. Embora Bezos não tenha declarado explicitamente que a Blue Origin planeia oferecer o seu novo veículo à NASA para a ambiciosa iniciativa da agência de pousar astronautas na Lua em 2024, uma descrição recém-publicada no site da empresa afirma que a variante da Blue Moon "foi projectada para pousar um veículo que nos permitirá levar novamente americanos à lua em 2024."</p>

<p>Também esta semana ficámos a saber que Jean-Jacques SAVIN, um aventureiro francês de 72 anos, chegou à ilha das caraíbas Martinica depois de cruzar com sucesso o Oceano Atlântico numa cápsula laranja em forma de barril.
A jornada demorou 122 dias no mar a cápsula onde ele se encontrava viajou cerca de 4,500 km. O ex-pára-quedista militar passou mais de quatro meses no barril, com 3 m de comprimento e 2,10 m de largura.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como alguns modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis. É apresentada a revista newelectronics de 23 de Abril.</p>

<p><em>"Blue Origin is shooting for the moon! The private spaceflight company revealed the first life-size mockup of its new lunar lander, named "Blue Moon," here at the Washington Convention Center today (May 9). "This is an incredible vehicle, and it’s going to the moon," Blue Origin founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos told a room full of spectators after the curtain dropped to reveal the big, shiny spacecraft. Blue Moon is designed to carry rovers and other large payloads to the lunar surface, but it could also take astronauts to the moon, said Bezos, who also founded Amazon.com and is the richest person in the world. To modify Blue Moon for a crewed spaceflight, the company would top the spacecraft with an attachable, pressurized ascent vehicle. Before launching astronauts to the moon, Blue Origin would first test out the lunar lander with an uncrewed mission, Bezos said."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/blue-origin-reveals-blue-moon-lander.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A 72-year-old French adventurer has landed on the Caribbean island of Martinique after successfully crossing the Atlantic Ocean in a barrel-shaped orange capsule. Jean-Jacques Savin set off on his journey in late December from El Hierro in Spain's Canary Islands. He used ocean currents alone to propel the capsule across the Atlantic. Mr Savin declared his trip a success on 27 April, when he entered the Caribbean after 122 days at sea. The journey covered more than 4,500km (2,800 miles). He was brought to the shore of France's overseas department of Martinique on Thursday by a French tugboat after being picked up at sea by a Dutch oil tanker."</em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48222707">[...]</a>

<p><em>"So it's a bit later in the day than I usually do this, just because I was waffling about the release. Partly because I got some small pull requests today, but mostly just because I wasn't looking forward to the timing of this upcoming 5.2 merge window. But the last-minute pull requests really weren't big enough to justify delaying things over, and hopefully the merge window timing won't be all that painful either. I just happen to have the college graduation of my oldest happen right smack dab in the middle of the upcoming merge window, so I might be effectively offline for a few days there. If worst comes to worst, I'll extend it to make it all work, but I don't think it will be needed. Anyway, on to 5.1 itself."</em> <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/5/5/278">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The STMicroelectronics HB2 650V IGBT series delivers efficiency and performance gains for medium- and high-speed applications such as PFC converters, welders, uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), and solar inverters, leveraging ST’s latest Trench Field Stop (TFS) technology. The series also includes automotive-eligible devices meeting AEC-Q101 Rev. D. STMicroelectronics’ 650V High-Frequency IGBTs Boost Performance with Latest High-Speed Technology Joining the STPOWER™ portfolio, the new HB2 series has outstanding conduction performance thanks to low VCEsat of 1.55V. At the same time, dynamic behavior is enhanced due to reduced gate charge that enables fast switching at low gate current. Outstanding thermal performance helps maximize reliability and power density, while the new products are also positioned as a very competitive choice in the market. The HB2 series IGBTs can be specified with either a full-rated or half-rated diode, or a protection diode to prevent accidental reverse bias, giving extra freedom to optimize the behavior for specific application needs."</em> <a href="https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/about/media-center/press-item.html/n4155.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/new-holographic-technique-opens-the-way-for-quantu/">New holographic technique opens the way for quantum computation</a></h2>

<p><em>"EPFL physicists have developed a method based on the principles of holograms to capture 3D images of objects beyond the reach of light. Photography measures how much light of different color hits the photographic film. However, light is also a wave, and is therefore characterized by the phase. Phase specifies the position of a point within the wave cycle and correlates to depth of information, meaning that recording the phase of light scattered by an object can retrieve its full 3D shape, which cannot be obtained with a simple photograph. This is the basis of optical holography, popularized by fancy holograms in sci-fi movies like Star Wars. But the problem is that the spatial resolution of the photo/hologram is limited by the wavelength of light, around or just-below 1 μm (0.001 mm)."</em> <a href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/new-holographic-technique-opens-the-way-for-quantu/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Research could enable a new suite of experiments to measure quantum activity at room temperature. Minutes before dawn on Sept. 14, 2015, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) became the first-ever instrument on Earth to directly detect a gravitational wave. This work, led by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration with prominent roles from MIT and Caltech, was the first confirmation of this consequence of Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity — 100 years after he first predicted it. The groundbreaking detection represented an enormous step forward in the field of astrophysics. In the years since, scientists have striven to achieve even greater sensitivity in the LIGO detectors. New research has taken investigators one step closer to this goal."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/quantum-measurement-could-improve-gravitational-wave-detection-sensitivity-0501">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2019/04/25/fast-efficient-artificial-synapse-developed/">Stanford researchers' artificial synapse is fast, efficient and durable</a></h2>

<p><em>"A battery-like device could act as an artificial synapse within computing systems intended to imitate the brain’s efficiency and ability to learn. The brain’s capacity for simultaneously learning and memorizing large amounts of information while requiring little energy has inspired an entire field to pursue brain-like – or neuromorphic – computers. Researchers at Stanford University and Sandia National Laboratories previously developed one portion of such a computer: a device that acts as an artificial synapse, mimicking the way neurons communicate in the brain. In a paper published online by the journal Science on April 25, the team reports that a prototype array of nine of these devices performed even better than expected in processing speed, energy efficiency, reproducibility and durability. Looking forward, the team members want to combine their artificial synapse with traditional electronics, which they hope could be a step toward supporting artificially intelligent learning on small devices. “If you have a memory system that can learn with the energy efficiency and speed that we’ve presented, then you can put that in a smartphone or laptop,” said Scott Keene, co-author of the paper and a graduate student in the lab of Alberto Salleo, professor of materials science and engineering at Stanford who is co-senior author."</em> <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2019/04/25/fast-efficient-artificial-synapse-developed/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"3D printing has become an increasingly important production method. Researchers at ETH have now developed a new 3D printing technique by which micrometre-sized objects made of several metals can be produced with high spatial resolution. 3D printers can print almost anything these days, from production prototypes to artificial organs all the way to entire houses. Particularly on a microscopic scale, additive manufacturing, as 3D printing is also known, makes it possible to produce structures which cannot be realized using other techniques such as lithography. Up to now, a weak point of additive manufacturing has been the realization of metallic structures at the micrometre scale. A team of researchers at ETH Zurich led by Ralph Spolenak, professor at the Laboratory for Nanometallurgy of the Department of Materials, together with Dimos Poulikakos of the Department of Mechanical and Process Engineering as well as Renato Zenobi of the Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences, have now developed a technique that even allows one to print two metals at the same time with a spatial resolution of 250 nanometres."</em> <a href="https://www.ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2019/04/3D-printing-of-metallic-micro-objects.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Integrating sensors and actuators using flexible electronics Currently, the manufacturing of self-actuating and self-sensing robots requires non-standard manufacturing techniques and assembly steps to integrate electrical and mechanical systems. In this work, we developed a novel manufacturing technique, where such robots can be produced at a flexible electronics factory. We developed the technique using standard industrial machines, processes, and materials. Using a lamination process, we were able to integrate air pouches or shape memory alloy (SMA) inside a polyamide-based flexible circuit to produce bending actuators. The bend angle of the actuators is sensed with a chain of inertial measurement units integrated on the actuator. Air-pouch actuators can produce a force of a 2.24N, and a maximum bend angle of 74 degrees."</em> <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/circuit-robots/overview/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A new computer processor architecture developed at the University of Michigan could usher in a future where computers proactively defend against threats, rendering the current electronic security model of bugs and patches obsolete. Called MORPHEUS, the chip blocks potential attacks by encrypting and randomly reshuffling key bits of its own code and data 20 times per second—infinitely faster than a human hacker can work and thousands of times faster than even the fastest electronic hacking techniques. “Today’s approach of eliminating security bugs one by one is a losing game,” said Todd Austin, U-M professor of computer science and engineering and a developer of the system. “People are constantly writing code, and as long as there is new code, there will be new bugs and security vulnerabilities. “With MORPHEUS, even if a hacker finds a bug, the information needed to exploit it vanishes 50 milliseconds later. It’s perhaps the closest thing to a future-proof secure system.” Austin and his colleagues have demonstrated a DARPA-funded prototype processor that successfully defended against every known variant of control-flow attack, one of hackers’ most dangerous and widely used techniques."</em> <a href="https://news.umich.edu/unhackable-new-chip-stops-attacks-before-they-start/">[...]</a>

Some have observed that for a device on Earth facing space, which has a frigid temperature, the chilling outflow of energy from the device can be harvested using the same kind of optoelectronic physics we have used to harness solar energy. New work, in a recent issue of Applied Physics Letters, from AIP Publishing, looks to provide a potential path to generating electricity like solar cells but that can power electronics at night. An international team of scientists has demonstrated for the first time that it is possible to generate a measurable amount of electricity in a diode directly from the coldness of the universe.

In these times of artificial intelligence, this no longer seems so far-fetched – for example, when a mobile phone can recognise faces or languages. With more complex applications, however, computers still quickly come up against their own limitations. One of the reasons for this is that a computer traditionally has separate memory and processor units – the consequence of which is that all data have to be sent back and forth between the two. In this respect, the human brain is way ahead of even the most modern computers because it processes and stores information in the same place – in the synapses, or connections between neurons, of which there are a million-billion in the brain."</em> <a href="https://www.uni-muenster.de/news/view.php?cmdid=10253">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Liquids or other objects appear colored because theyreflect or transmit certain colors and in turn swallow (absorb) others. With a so-called photometer, those colors (wavelengths) can be determined, which are absorbed by liquids. The basic principle is simple: with a LED of a certain color you first shine through a cuvette filled with water or another solvent. A photodiode measures the incoming light intensity and converts it into a proportional voltage U0. This value is noted. Thereafter, a cuvette with the liquid to be examined is placed in the beam path and again measures the light intensity or voltage U."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-LED-photometer-With-Arduino-for-Physics-or-Che/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This Arduino based digital clock is synchronized by the 60Hz power line. It has a simple and inexpensive common anode 4 digit 7 segment display which shows hours and minutes. It uses a cross over detector to detect when the incoming 60Hz sine wave crosses the zero voltage point and derives a 60 Hz square wave. Over short time periods the frequency of the incoming sine wave from the power line may vary very slightly due to load, but over long periods of time it averages to 60Hz very precisely. We can take advantage of this to derive a timing source to synchronize our clock. "</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Digital-Clock-Synchronized-by-the-60Hz-Pow/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In this tutorial, you'll learn everything you need to know to get started controlling your home with Home Assistant, an open source home automation hub that puts local control and privacy first, running off of a Raspberry Pi. In this tutorial we'll cover how to set up Home Assistant, and regardless of whether you created the devices yourself or purchased off the shelf IoT devices, get them working together in harmony. While this guide walks you through the setup of Home Assistant, this is not a tutorial about how to get the most out of Home Assistant (but a quick Google search for Home Assistant tutorials will provide you with endless links to do so). Installing Home Assistant To get started, we'll first need to install Home Assistant by downloading the image for your device. Home Assistant's installation page does a great job outlining how to flash the image to your SD card, but after you download your image you'll need to install Hass.io by connecting your SD card to your computer and flash the image using a program called balenaEtcher.
