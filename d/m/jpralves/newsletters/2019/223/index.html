<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1901, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Lawrence">Ernest Lawrence</a>. Este físico norte-americano recebeu o Prémio Nobel de Física de 1939 pela sua invenção do ciclotrão, o primeiro dispositivo para a produção de partículas de alta energia. O seu primeiro dispositivo, construído em 1930, usava um íman de 10 cm. Ele acelerou partículas dentro de um reciclador em alto vácuo entre os pólos de um electroíman para confinar o feixe a uma espiral, enquanto uma alta voltagem de corrente alternada aumentou a energia da partícula. Os modelos maiores criados posteriormente criaram feixes de 8 x 104 eV. Ao colidir partículas com núcleos atómicos, ele produziu novos elementos e radioactividade artificial. Em 1940, ele tinha conseguido criar plutónio e neptúnio. Ele ampliou o uso da radiação atómica nos campos da biologia e da medicina. O elemento 103 foi nomeado Laurêncio como um tributo a ele.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1931, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penrose">Roger Penrose</a>. Este Matemático e físico teórico britânico na década de 1960 calculou muitas das características básicas dos buracos negros. Penrose fez contribuições para a física matemática da relatividade geral e cosmologia. Ele recebeu vários prémios, incluindo o Wolf Prize de 1988 pela física, que compartilhou com Stephen Hawking para os teoremas de singularidade de Penrose-Hawking.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1938, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Edward_Baldwin">Jack Edward Baldwin</a>. Este químico britânico criou as Regras de Baldwin para reacções de fecho de anéis em química orgânica. Com base em evidências empíricas, estas regras consideram as taxas relativas (ou favoravelmente) do fecho do anel em compostos ali-cíclicos. Durante seu Ph.D. estudos no Imperial College, em Londres, ele trabalhou para o prémio Nobel, Sir Derek Barton. Após seu treino como químico orgânico sintético, ele manteve um interesse no desafio da síntese de compostos naturais complexos. Depois de alguns anos no M.I.T. (1969-1978), Baldwin passou a maior parte de sua carreira de pesquisa em laboratórios em Oxford. Ele foi condecorado em 1997 por suas contribuições para a química orgânica.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber, pelas palavras do CEO da SpaceX, Elon Musk que o primeiro protótipo orbital do veículo Starship para colonizar Marte deve estar pronto para voar em breve. A SpaceX está a construir dois transportadores orbitais de Starship - um pouco de competição dentro da companhia com a intenção de melhorar o desenho final da nave espacial. O protótipo conhecido como Mk1 está a ser desenvolvido nas instalações da empresa em Boca Chica, Texas, enquanto o Mk2 está a ser construído na Space Coast da Flórida. As naves Mk1 e Mk2 são diferentes do protótipo basico conhecido como Starhopper, que recentemente fez seu primeiro lançamento livre em Boca Chica. O Starhopper tem apenas um motor Raptor e permanecerá firmemente dentro da atmosfera da Terra durante a fase de testes. Mk1 e Mk2, por outro lado, terão pelo menos três Raptors e foram projectados para alcançar a órbita, disse Musk. A versão finalizada de 100 passageiros do Starship terá seis Raptors. Super Heavy, o foguete gigante que lançará o Starship na superfície da Terra, terá 35 desses motores de última geração, disse Musk recentemente.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker.</p>

<p><em>"The first orbital prototype of SpaceX's Mars-colonizing Starship vehicle should be ready to fly soon, company founder and CEO Elon Musk said. SpaceX is building two orbital Starship forerunners — a bit of intracompany competition intended to improve the design of the final spacecraft. The prototype known as Mk1 is coming together at the company's facility in Boca Chica, Texas, whereas Mk2 is being built on Florida's Space Coast. The Mk1 and Mk2 craft are different from the stripped-down prototype known as Starhopper, which recently made its first untethered hop at Boca Chica. Starhopper has just one Raptor engine and will stay firmly within Earth's atmosphere throughout the testing phase. Mk1 and Mk2, on the other hand, will feature at least three Raptors and are designed to reach orbit, Musk has said."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-starship-prototype-elon-musk-photos.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Chinese tech giant Alibaba claims to have designed the fastest RISC-V processor to date, and reckons it will open source at least some of the blueprints for others to use. The chip was unveiled this week at Alibaba's Cloud Summit in the Middle Kingdom, though details are curiously thin. Word reaches us of the development, though, amid China's soaring interest in the fledgling RISC-V, which at its heart is an open-source instruction set architecture backed by Google, Nvidia, Western Digital, Qualcomm, Alibaba, and others. RISC-V is exciting for China because it allows the nation's eggheads to access, improve, and extend a bunch of the West's processor technology without having to worry about any future US trade sanctions, thanks to the architecture family's openly available materials. Everything you need to start experimenting with the tech and improving it – the ISA documentation, CPU cores, and software stacks – is already out there over the internet, and it's too late to cut that knowledge off. While the RISC-V ISA is open source, implementations of its CPU cores don't have to be – and yet, there are a range of cores available to download, evaluate, and drop into FPGAs, ASICs, or system-on-chips, for free."</em> <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/07/27/alibaba_risc_v_chip/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"SMC 1000 8x25G enables high memory bandwidth required by next-generation CPUs and SoCs for AI and machine learning As the computational demands of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning workloads accelerate, traditional parallel attached DRAM memory has presented a major roadblock for next-generation CPUs, which require an increased number of memory channels to deliver more memory bandwidth. Microchip Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP) today announced an expanded data center portfolio and its entrance into the memory infrastructure market with the industry’s first commercially available serial memory controller. The SMC 1000 8x25G enables CPUs and other compute-centric SoCs to utilize four times the memory channels of parallel attached DDR4 DRAM within the same package footprint. Microchip’s serial memory controllers deliver higher memory bandwidth and media independence to these compute-intensive platforms with ultra-low latency. As the number of processing cores within CPUs has risen, the average memory bandwidth available to each processing core has decreased because CPU and SoC devices cannot scale the number of parallel DDR interfaces on a single chip to meet the needs of the increasing core count. The SMC 1000 8x25G interfaces to the CPU via 8-bit Open Memory Interface (OMI)-compliant 25 Gbps lanes and bridges to memory via a 72-bit DDR4 3200 interface."</em> <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en/pressreleasepage/microchip-enters-memory-infrastructure-market-with-serial-memory">[...]</a>

Rice University scientists are designing arrays of aligned single-wall carbon nanotubes to channel mid-infrared radiation (aka heat) and greatly raise the efficiency of solar energy systems. A Rice University simulation shows an array of cavities patterned into a film of aligned carbon nanotubes. When optimized, the film absorbs thermal photons and emits light in a narrow bandwidth that can be recycled as electricity. Illustration by Chloe Doiron Gururaj Naik and Junichiro Kono of Rice’s Brown School of Engineering introduced their technology in ACS Photonics. Their invention is a hyperbolic thermal emitter that can absorb intense heat that would otherwise be spewed into the atmosphere, squeeze it into a narrow bandwidth and emit it as light that can be turned into electricity."</em> <a href="https://news.rice.edu/2019/07/12/rice-device-channels-heat-into-light/">[...]</a>

Purdue University researchers have demonstrated a new way to measure the phenomenon of entanglement in chemical reactions – the ability of quantum particles to maintain a special correlation with each other over a large distance. Uncovering exactly how chemical reactions work could bring ways to mimic or re-create them in new technologies, such as for designing better solar energy systems. The study, published on Friday (Aug. 2) in Science Advances, generalizes a popular theorem called “Bell’s inequality” to identify entanglement in chemical reactions. In addition to theoretical arguments, the researchers also validated the generalized inequality through a quantum simulation. “No one has experimentally shown entanglement in chemical reactions yet because we haven’t had a way to measure it."</em> <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2019/Q3/quantum-entanglement-in-chemical-reactions-now-theres-a-way-to-find-out.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"While artificial leaves hold promise as a way to take carbon dioxide — a potent greenhouse gas — out of the atmosphere, there is a “dark side to artificial leaves that has gone overlooked for more than a decade,” according to Meenesh Singh, assistant professor of chemical engineering in the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Engineering. Artificial leaves work by converting carbon dioxide to fuel and water to oxygen using energy from the sun. The two processes take place separately and simultaneously on either side of a photovoltaic cell: the oxygen is produced on the “positive” side of the cell and fuel is produced on the “negative” side. Singh, who is the corresponding author of a new paper in ACS Applied Energy Materials, says that current artificial leaves are wildly inefficient. They wind up converting only 15% of the carbon dioxide they take in into fuel and release 85% of it, along with oxygen gas, back to the atmosphere. “The artificial leaves we have today aren’t really ready to fulfill their promise as carbon capture solutions because they don’t capture all that much carbon dioxide, and in fact, release the majority of the carbon dioxide gas they take in from the oxygen-evolving ‘positive’ side,” Singh said."</em> <a href="https://today.uic.edu/clearing-up-the-dark-side-of-artificial-leaves">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A silicon-based transistor that displays quantum interference effects at useful temperatures paves the way for highly sensitive sensors Using a silicon-based transistor similar to those found in everyday electronics, RIKEN researchers have produced a functional quantum ‘qubit’—the quantum equivalent of bits used in conventional computers—that operates above the extremely low temperatures typically needed to observe quantum interference effects1. The study breaks open the exploration of quantum interference to enable research using standard materials and techniques at more accessible temperatures. Many highly sensitive measurement techniques are based on monitoring the interference of waves. The most well-known example is the detection of extremely weak gravitational waves generated by colliding neutron stars and black holes using the interference between two laser beams that are several kilometers long. Many scientists are working on extending this technique to the wave functions of quantum objects since this would permit much more sensitive sensing than is possible using classical waves. A promising system for achieving such quantum interferometry is silicon because researchers can draw on the many decades of research and development that have gone into conventional silicon-based electronics and integrated circuits."</em> <a href="http://www.riken.jp/en/research/rikenresearch/highlights/20190802_FY20190018/">[...]</a>
