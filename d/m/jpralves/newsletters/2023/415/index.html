<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1748, o engenheiro e inventor inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Bramah">Joseph Bramah</a>. Ele criou a loja de fabrico de fechaduras foi o berço da indústria britânica de máquinas-ferramentas. Central no início do fabrico e fabrico de eclusas vitorianas, influenciou quase todos os ofícios mecânicos da época. Tal como Henry Ford, a sua influência foi provavelmente maior para os processos de fabrico que desenvolveu, do que o próprio produto. Tirou a sua primeira patente sobre uma fechadura de segurança (1784) e em 1795 patenteou a sua prensa hidráulica, conhecida como prensa Bramah, utilizada para forjagem pesada. Concebeu uma máquina de impressão numérica para notas bancárias e foi um dos primeiros a sugerir a praticabilidade das hélices de parafuso e da transmissão hidráulica. Inventou máquinas de fresagem e aplainamento e outras máquinas-ferramentas, um motor de cerveja (1797), e um armário de água.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1771, o engenheiro mecânico e inventor inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Trevithick">Richard Trevithick</a>. Ele aproveitou, com sucesso, o vapor de alta pressão e construiu a primeira locomotiva ferroviária a vapor do mundo (1803). Em 1805 adaptou o seu motor de alta pressão à condução de um laminador de ferro e à propulsão de uma barcaça com a ajuda de rodas de pás. Também fez experiências com um vagão a vapor como locomotiva de estrada. Em 1812, inventou a caldeira Cornish na qual os gases de combustão quentes também podiam ser utilizados para aquecer a água, melhorando assim a sua eficiência. As melhorias combinadas de Trevithick fizeram com que o novo desenho do motor da Cornish duplicasse ou triplicasse o serviço do tipo James Watt, e assim os suplantaram como o tipo Watt tinha suplantado os estilos Newcomen.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1888, o inventor norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hays_Hammond_Jr.">John Hays Hammond Jr.</a>. Ele trabalhou no desenvolvimento de controlo remoto via rádio serviu de base para os modernos sistemas de orientação de mísseis. Filho do notável engenheiro de minas norte-americano John Hays Hammond, criou o Laboratório de Investigação de Rádio Hammond em 1911. Em 1914, ele tinha lançado as bases para todo o controlo de rádio subsequente, capaz de enviar um iate não tripulado numa viagem bem sucedida de 120 milhas de Gloucester para Boston e de volta. Com a Primeira Guerra Mundial, Hammond acrescentou uma funcionalidade anti-interferência para evitar o encravamento. Também inventou um sistema de procura de alvos que permitia a um navio telecomandado regressar a casa nos holofotes de um navio inimigo; e começou a trabalhar no primeiro torpedo guiado por rádio. Em 1916, tinha ganho mais de 100 patentes.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1889, o criptógrafo norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Yardley">Herbert Yardley</a>. Ele organizou e dirigiu os primeiros esforços formais de quebra de códigos do governo dos EUA durante e após a Primeira Guerra Mundial. Durante a I Guerra Mundial, serviu como oficial criptográfico nas Forças Expedicionárias Americanas em França, durante a I Guerra Mundial. Na década de 1920, quando era chefe do MI-8, a primeira organização criptanalítica americana em tempo de paz, ele e uma equipa de criptanalistas exploraram quase duas dúzias de sistemas de cifras diplomáticas estrangeiras. O MI-8 foi dissolvido em 1929, quando o Departamento de Estado retirou o financiamento. Jobless, Yardley causou uma sensação em 1931 ao publicar as suas memórias do MI-8, The American Black Chamber, o que provocou a promulgação de novas leis de segurança.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1892, o físico escocês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Watson-Watt">Robert Watson-Watt</a>. Ele é creditado pelo desenvolvimento da localização de radares de aeronaves, em Inglaterra. Estudou na Universidade de St Andrews, ensinou na Universidade de Dundee, e em 1917 trabalhou no Gabinete Meteorológico, concebendo dispositivos de localização de trovoadas, e investigando a ionosfera (um termo que inventou em 1926). Tornou-se chefe da secção de rádio do Laboratório Nacional de Física (1935), onde começou a trabalhar na localização de aeronaves. O seu trabalho levou ao desenvolvimento do radar (RAdio Detection And Ranging) que desempenhou um papel vital na defesa da Grã-Bretanha contra os ataques aéreos alemães em 1940.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1909, o matemático polaco-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislaw_Ulam">Stanislaw Ulam</a>. Ele desempenhou um papel importante no desenvolvimento da bomba de hidrogénio em Los Alamos. Ele resolveu o problema de como iniciar a fusão na bomba de hidrogénio sugerindo que a compressão era essencial à explosão e que as ondas de choque de uma bomba de fissão podiam produzir a compressão necessária. Sugeriu ainda que uma concepção cuidadosa poderia focalizar as ondas de choque mecânico de modo a promover a rápida queima do combustível de fusão. Ulam, com J.C. Everett, também propôs o plano "Orion" para a propulsão nuclear de veículos espaciais. Enquanto Ulam esteve em Los Alamos, ele desenvolveu o "método Monte-Carlo" que procurava soluções para problemas matemáticos utilizando um método de amostragem estatística com números aleatórios.</p>

<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1913, o anestesista e inventor norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Andrew_Hingson">Robert Andrew Hingson</a>. Ele é conhecido por três grandes invenções que continuam a aliviar a dor e o sofrimento em todo o mundo nos dias de hoje. Uma é um aparelho de anestesia respiratória muito portátil e um reanimador, chamado "Western Reserve Midget", utilizado para administrar uma anestesia geral de curto prazo. Um segundo veio de extensas experiências no uso da anestesia para prevenir a dor durante o parto, levando à invenção das técnicas de anestesia caudal contínua. Mais conhecida é a sua "arma da paz", um injector de jacto em forma de pistola que permitiu uma inoculação eficiente, em massa e sem agulha em todo o mundo contra doenças como varíola, sarampo, tuberculose, tétano, lepra, poliomielite e gripe. Pode inocular 1.000 pessoas por hora com várias vacinas simultâneas.</p>

<p>Em 1960, o primeiro satélite de navegação dos EUA, o Transit-1B foi lançado do cabo Canaveral, Florida, sobre um foguete Thor-Ablestar e o Ablestar efectuou o primeiro arranque do motor no espaço para refinar a órbita. A carga útil, pesando 265 libras, incluía 2 osciladores ultra-estáveis, 2 transmissores e receptores de telemetria, baterias e células solares. O sistema Transit foi concebido para satisfazer a necessidade da Marinha de localizar com precisão submarinos de mísseis balísticos e outros navios. Atingiu a capacidade operacional inicial em 1964 e a capacidade total em Outubro de 1968. As suas emissões de navegação foram desligadas deliberadamente em 31 de Dezembro de 1996. Os Chefes de Estado-Maior tinham decidido confiar apenas no GPS para navegação e posicionamento, reformados após mais de 32 anos de serviço contínuo e bem sucedido à Marinha dos EUA.</p>

<p>Em 1970, uma explosão durante a missão Apollo 13 levou a uma das mais espectaculares missões de salvamento na história espacial dos EUA. A explosão a bordo da nave espacial Odyssey deixou a tripulação encalhada durante quatro dias a mais de 200.000 milhas da Terra. Uma fuga de oxigénio forçou os astronautas da Apollo 13 a abandonar a nave e a regressar no módulo lunar. Contra todas as probabilidades, os três astronautas e milhares de outros trouxeram a cápsula de volta à Terra em segurança. Os astronautas foram Fred Haise, Jack Swigert, e o Comandante Jim Lovell, e a missão era ter feito o terceiro desembarque tripulado da lua.</p>

<p><em>"The update brings loads of improvements, the most significant being new driving capabilities. Years in the making, a major software update that has been installed on NASA’s Curiosity rover will enable the Mars robot to drive faster and reduce wear and tear on its wheels. Those are just two of about 180 changes implemented during the update, which required the team to put Curiosity’s science and imaging operations on hold between April 3 and April 7. “The flight software is essential to our mission, so this is a big deal for our team,” said Curiosity Project Manager Kathya Zamora-Garcia of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. “This is a major software update, and we had to make sure we did it right.” Planning for this update goes back to 2016, when Curiosity last received a software overhaul. Some changes this time around are as small as making corrections to the messages the rover sends back to mission controllers on Earth."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-curiosity-mars-rover-gets-a-major-software-upgrade">[...]</a>

In a study published in Nature Astronomy, researchers at The University of Texas at Austin find that six of the earliest and most massive galaxy candidates observed by JWST stand to contradict the prevailing thinking in cosmology. That’s because other researchers estimate that each galaxy is seen from between 500 million and 700 million years after the Big Bang, yet measures more than 10 billion times as massive as our sun. One of the galaxies even appears to be more massive than the Milky Way, despite the fact that our own galaxy had billions of more years to form and grow. “If the masses are right, then we are in uncharted territory,” said Mike Boylan-Kolchin, associate professor of astronomy who led the study. “We’ll require something very new about galaxy formation or a modification to cosmology."</em> <a href="https://news.utexas.edu/2023/04/13/james-webb-space-telescope-images-challenge-theories-of-how-universe-evolved/">[...]</a>

For decades, scientists have also been interested in high-temperature superconductors: ceramic materials where electron interactions yield a macroscopic quantum state where electrons pair with each other.

<p><em>"Method can depict holograms – viewable from any angle as if physically present – with continuous depth Holography – the use of light projection to display images – can be used to construct holograms, which are three-dimensional structures of light that depict true-to-life objects and scenes. While today’s technologies can’t yet produce the incredibly lifelike holograms of science fiction movies, researchers from the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) have made a significant leap toward this goal. A team of scientists and engineers led by Federico Capasso, the Robert L. Wallace Professor of Applied Physics and Vinton Hayes Senior Research Fellow in Electrical Engineering at SEAS, has reported in Nature Photonics an entirely new way of creating holograms using threads of light layered to construct 2D sheets containing tightly-controlled arrays of light. These sheets can then be tightly stacked – like a pile of deli cheese – to depict 3D objects. “This research leverages in an innovative way the widely used and commercially established technology of spatial light modulators to shape light as it propagates, creating an entirely new class of holograms,” says Capasso. “I foresee that this holography method will have impact on virtual and augmented reality, biological imaging, volumetric displays, human-computer interactions, interactive educational tools, and more.” Traditional holography methods arrange light in planes moving away from the eye of the viewer like a series of sequential dominoes, which is problematic because the layers farthest away become harder to see."</em> <a href="https://seas.harvard.edu/news/2023/04/new-light-sheet-holography-overcomes-depth-perception-challenge-3d-holograms">[...]</a>

A member of the research group headed by MIT Professor Saman Amarasinghe in the Institute’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), Brahmakshatriya wanted these languages to come with all the auxiliary functions people would need to comfortably utilize them, including tools for debugging. This process for getting rid of errors in a piece of software is essential, he and Amarasinghe agreed, as they have called the lack of debugging support “the Achilles heel for DSLs.” It’s been a productive few years for both of them.

And because there can be hours and even days with no wind, for example, some energy storage devices must be able to store a large amount of electricity for a long time. A promising technology for performing that task is the flow battery, an electrochemical device that can store hundreds of megawatt-hours of energy — enough to keep thousands of homes running for many hours on a single charge.

Materials that strongly change their resistivity under magnetic fields are highly sought for various applications and, for example, every car and every computer contain many tiny magnetic sensors. Such materials are rare, and most metals and semiconductors change their electrical resistivity only by a tiny fraction of a percent at room temperature and in practically viable magnetic fields (typically, by less than a millionth of 1 %). To observe a strong magnetoresistance response, researchers usually cool materials to liquid-helium temperatures so that electrons inside scatter less and can follow cyclotron trajectories. Now a research team led by Professor Sir Andre Geim has found that good old graphene that seemed to be studied in every detail over the last two decade exhibits a remarkably strong response, reaching above 100% in magnetic fields of standard permanent magnets (of about 1,000 Gauss).

Researchers from the University of Cambridge designed a soft, 3D-printed robotic hand that cannot independently move its fingers but can still carry out a range of complex movements.

<h2><a href="https://www.riken.jp/en/news_pubs/research_news/rr/20230410_3/index.html">Stripes within crystals hint at behavior of electrons in quantum systems</a></h2>

<p><em>"A hidden pattern of electrons could provide clues to exotic quantum behavior Hidden stripes in a crystal could help scientists understand the mysterious behavior of electrons in certain quantum systems, including high-temperature superconductors, an unexpected discovery by RIKEN physicists suggests1. The electrons in most materials interact with each other very weakly. But physicists often observe interesting properties in materials in which electrons strongly interact with each other. In these materials, the electrons often collectively behave as particles, giving rise to ‘quasiparticles’. “A crystal can be thought of like an alternative universe with different laws of physics that allow different fundamental particles to live there,” says Christopher Butler of the RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science. Butler and colleagues examined a crystal in which a layer of nickel atoms was arranged in a square lattice, like a chessboard."</em> <a href="https://www.riken.jp/en/news_pubs/research_news/rr/20230410_3/index.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Physicists relate the quantum property of ‘magic’ to the chaotic nature of black holes for the first time A quantum property dubbed ‘magic’ could be the key to explaining how space and time emerged, a new mathematical analysis by three RIKEN physicists suggests1. It’s hard to conceive of anything more basic than the fabric of spacetime that underpins the Universe, but theoretical physicists have been questioning this assumption. “Physicists have long been fascinated about the possibility that space and time are not fundamental, but rather are derived from something deeper,” says Kanato Goto of the RIKEN Interdisciplinary Theoretical and Mathematical Sciences (iTHEMS). This notion received a boost in the 1990s, when theoretical physicist Juan Maldacena related the gravitational theory that governs spacetime to a theory involving quantum particles. In particular, he imagined a hypothetical space—which can be pictured as being enclosed in something like an infinite soup can, or ‘bulk’—holding objects like black holes that are acted on by gravity. Maldacena also imagined particles moving on the surface of the can, controlled by quantum mechanics."</em> <a href="https://www.riken.jp/en/news_pubs/research_news/rr/20230413_2/index.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The development of quantum computers will benefit from a new model that models spin in tiny silicon dots A theoretical model developed by three RIKEN physicists for optimizing semiconductor nanodevices will be helpful for scaling up quantum hardware1. An electron trapped in a semiconductor device offers a promising building block for future quantum computers. Electrons have a property called spin, which, when measured, exists in one of two states—like the binary information, or bits, used in conventional computing. But due to its quantum nature, spin can exist in a superposition of the two states. These quantum bits, or qubits, lie at the heart of quantum information processing. Electrons, or their positively charged counterparts known as holes, can be isolated in tiny semiconductor blobs called quantum dots."</em> <a href="https://www.riken.jp/en/news_pubs/research_news/rr/20230410_2/index.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"While programmers today take division for granted, most microprocessors in the 1970s could only add and subtract — division required a slow and tedious loop implemented in assembly code. One of the nice features of the Intel 8086 processor (1978) was that it provided machine instructions for integer multiplication and division. Internally, the 8086 still performed a loop, but the loop was implemented in microcode: faster and transparent to the programmer. Even so, division was a slow operation, about 50 times slower than addition. I recently examined multiplication in the 8086, and now it's time to look at the division microcode.1 (There's a lot of overlap with the multiplication post so apologies for any deja vu.)
