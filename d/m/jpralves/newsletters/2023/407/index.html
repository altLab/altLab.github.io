<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1514, o astrónomo e matemático alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Joachim_Rheticus">Georg Joachim Rheticus</a>. Ele foi um dos primeiros a adoptar e difundir a teoria heliocêntrica de Nicolau Copérnico. Foi primeiro ensinado pelo seu pai, um médico, que foi decapitado por feitiçaria (1528) enquanto Rheticus ainda era adolescente. Ele é mais conhecido como o primeiro discípulo de Copérnico. Em 1540, Rheticus publicou o primeiro relato da hipótese heliocêntrica que tinha sido elaborada por Copérnico, intitulado Narratio prima, que foi explicitamente autorizado por Copérnico, que também pediu a ajuda do seu amigo para editar a edição do seu De revolutionibus orbium coelestium ("Sobre as revoluções das esferas celestiais"). Rheticus foi o primeiro matemático a considerar as funções trigonométricas em termos de ângulos e não de arcos de um círculo.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1698, o físico francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Bouguer">Pierre Bouguer</a>. Ele fundou a fotometria, a medição da intensidade da luz. Era uma criança prodígio, professor aos 15 anos, seguindo o seu pai, Jean Bouguer, em hidrografia - o estudo dos corpos de água, tanto salgada como fresca. Participou na expedição ao Peru (1735-44) para medir um arco do meridiano perto do equador. Em 1729, inventou um fotómetro para comparar a intensidade de duas fontes de luz iluminando metades separadas de papel translúcido. O próprio olho, ele determinou, não podia ser utilizado como um metro, mas podia estabelecer a igualdade de brilho das superfícies adjacentes. Ele determinou que o sol era 300 vezes mais brilhante do que a lua. A lei de Bouguer dá a atenuação de um feixe de luz por um meio opticamente homogéneo (transparente).</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1826, o químico dinamarquês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Peter_J%C3%B8rgen_Julius_Thomsen">Julius Thomsen</a>. Ele tabulou a quantidade de calor libertada ou absorvida em 3.500 reacções químicas. Ele originou o termo acidez e preparou a primeira tabela das forças relativas dos ácidos. Tornou-se rico com o seu processo (patenteado em 1853) para a fabricação de soda a partir da criolita mineral. Em 1878, Thomsen (e independentemente por Marcellin Berthelot) propôs que cada mudança química prosseguisse numa direcção tal que produzisse o maior calor. No entanto, esta afirmação é incorrecta, pois são conhecidas muitas excepções em que as reacções químicas são espontâneas, apesar de absorverem calor. Thomsen concebeu o formato moderno de grupos e períodos na forma longa da Tabela Periódica dos Elementos (1895).</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1843, o inventor e industrial americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_M._Leland">Henry Martyn Leland</a>. Ele fundou a Cadillac Motors (22 de Agosto de 1902) para construir o Cadillac, o primeiro automóvel com peças de alta precisão e totalmente intercambiáveis. No início da sua vida, tinha aprendido a fabricar espingardas de precisão durante a Guerra Civil, inventou os primeiros cortadores mecânicos de barbeiro, e fez motores para Oldsmobiles. Quando Leland concebeu um motor melhorado, mas Olds não o quis adoptar, Leland iniciou a Cadillac para construir a sua própria marca de automóveis. Ele acabou por vender a empresa à Will Durant's General Motors Co. Durante a I Guerra Mundial, formou uma nova empresa para fabricar motores de aviões, que após a guerra produziu um novo automóvel: o Lincoln. Esta empresa foi comprada por Henry Ford.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1901, o químico e inventor inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rex_Whinfield">John Rex Whinfield</a>. Ele (assistido por James Tennant Dickson) inventou um novo poliéster, tereftalato de polietileno, (1941) a partir da reacção de condensação de etilenoglicol com ácido tereftálico. Eram químicos empregados pela Calico Printer's Association of Manchester. A patente que registaram em Julho de 1941 foi adiada pela II Guerra Mundial, mas acabou por ser registada em 1946. Como fibra têxtil, foi-lhe atribuído o nome comercial Terylene quando foi comercializada na Grã-Bretanha (1947) pela Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), que comprou os direitos, e para quem Whinfield trabalhou a partir de 1947. Quando os direitos norte-americanos foram comprados e desenvolvidos pela Dupont na América, era conhecida como Dacron. O material continua a ser popular para lavar e usar roupa.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1935, o engenheiro e inventor norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradford_Parkinson">Bradford Parkinson</a>. Ele é conhecido como o arquitecto líder, defensor e promotor, com as primeiras contribuições de Ivan Getting e Roger Easton, do programa NAVSTAR da Força Aérea, mais conhecido como Sistema de Posicionamento Global.</p>

<p><em>"Peering through obscuring clouds of dust, the MIRI instrument has revealed networks of giant cavities and blown-out bubbles in the gaseous arms of distant galaxies. Researchers using NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope are getting their first look at star formation, gas, and dust in nearby galaxies with unprecedented resolution at infrared wavelengths. The data has enabled an initial collection of 21 research papers which provide new insight into how some of the smallest-scale processes in our universe – the beginnings of star formation – impact the evolution of the largest objects in our cosmos: galaxies. The largest survey of nearby galaxies in Webb’s first year of science operations is being carried out by the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby Galaxies (PHANGS) collaboration, involving more than 100 researchers from around the globe. The Webb observations are led by Janice Lee, Gemini Observatory chief scientist at the National Science Foundation’s NOIRLab and affiliate astronomer at the University of Arizona in Tucson. The team is studying a diverse sample of 19 spiral galaxies, and in Webb’s first few months of science operations, observations of five of those targets – M74, NGC 7496, IC 5332, NGC 1365, and NGC 1433 – have taken place."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-webb-reveals-intricate-networks-of-gas-dust-in-nearby-galaxies">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The Red Planet rover snapped a portrait of the sample depot it has assembled with 10 backup sample tubes that could be returned to Earth by a future mission. Even space robots know what “pics or it didn’t happen” means: NASA’s Perseverance Mars rover provided a panorama of its recently completed sample depot – a big milestone for the mission and humanity’s first collection of samples on another planet. The panorama, stitched together from 368 images that were sent to Earth, captures more than a month of careful placement and mapping of 10 titanium tubes. Eight of those tubes are filled with rock and regolith (broken rock and dust), while one is an atmospheric sample and one is a “witness” tube. The rover photographed the depot using the Mastcam-Z camera on the top of its mast, or “head,” on Jan. 31, 2023. The color has been adjusted to show the Martian surface approximately as it would look to the human eye."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-perseverance-rover-shows-off-collection-of-mars-samples">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4514.html">STMicroelectronics reveals broad selection of antenna-matching RF integrated passive devices for STM32WL MCUs</a></h2>

<p><em>"STMicroelectronics has released nine RF integrated passive devices (RF IPDs) that combine antenna impedance-matching, balun, and harmonic-filter circuity optimized for STM32WL wireless microcontrollers (MCUs). ST’s STM32WL MCUs combine application-level processing and wireless communication for smart, connected devices, by integrating an Arm® Cortex®-M4 MCU with a sub-GHz long-range radio managed by a Cortex-M0+ core. The radio is LPWAN compliant, supports multiple modulation schemes, and comes with LoRaWAN® and Sigfox™ stacks included in the STM32CubeWL MCU software package. The RF IPDs, packaged as tiny chip-scale devices, connect the STM32WL MCU to its antenna and help maximize the RF performance. By integrating all the components on one die, they ensure consistent performance avoiding the process variations that affect conventional matching networks built with discrete components. They also simplify circuit design, save on bill of materials, and permit a smaller form factor, making them ideal for cost-sensitive and space-constrained IoT devices."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4514.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Newly developed filter simultaneously removes particulate matter and volatile organic chemicals as primary air pollutants while retaining initial performance for up to 20 years Samsung Electronics today introduced a new air filter technology that simultaneously collects particulate matter (PM) and decomposes Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and can be used for 20 years through simple water washing. A study about the technology was published in the journal Nature Communications on 15th February UK Time. “This project started from listening to suggestions from manufacturers and users of air purification filters,” said Hyuk Jae Kwon, one of the lead-/corresponding authors at Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT). “We plan to expand the research into accelerating the commercialization of long-lifetime filters in the future.” Conventional air purification filters need frequent replacement because of their short cycle of six months to one year. In addition, every single filter can only remove either PM or VOCs, respectively, limiting air purifiers’ space efficiency. To address these problems, researchers at SAIT developed and implemented an unprecedented filter technology that applies photocatalysts such as copper oxide (Cu2O) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) for the first time and verifies the viability for commercialization."</em> <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-introduces-easily-regenerable-air-purification-filter-technology-applying-photocatalysts">[...]</a>

In a study published in the journal Science, researchers at The University of Texas at Austin discovered that a frictional phenomenon could be key to understanding when and how violently faults move. That’s because the phenomenon, which explains why it takes more effort to shove a heavy box from a standstill than it does to keep it moving, governs how quickly the fault surfaces bond together, or heal, after an earthquake. A fault that is slow to heal is more likely to move harmlessly, while one that heals quickly is more likely to stick until it breaks in a large, damaging earthquake. The discovery could be key to understanding when, and how violently, faults move. That alone won’t allow scientists to predict when the next big one will strike — the forces behind large earthquakes are too complex — but it does give researchers a valuable new way to investigate the causes and potential for a large, damaging earthquake to happen, the authors said."</em> <a href="https://www.jsg.utexas.edu/news/2023/02/earthquake-scientists-have-a-new-tool-in-the-race-to-find-the-next-big-one/">[...]</a>

The study, directed by chemical and biomolecular engineering professor Xiao Su, demonstrates a device capable of an eightfold concentration of nitrate, a 24-times enhancement of ammonium production rate and a greater than tenfold enhancement in energy efficiency compared with previous nitrate-to-ammonia electrocatalysis methods. “By combining separation with reaction, we overcame previously existing limitations of producing ammonia directly from groundwater, where the concentrations of nitrate are very low, and thus make the conversion step inefficient,” Su said. The findings are published in the journal Nature Communications. “The goal of this study was to use as little energy as possible to remove nitrate from agricultural runoff before it hits our waterways, and transform it back to a fertilizer or sell it as a chemical feedstock,” Su said."</em> <a href="https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/39691484">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The Russo-Ukrainian conflict and the COVID-19 pandemic have shown how vulnerable global supply chains can be. International events can disrupt manufacturing, delay shipping, induce panic buying and send energy costs soaring. New research in quantum computing at Sandia National Laboratories is moving science closer to being able to overcome supply-chain challenges and restore global security during future periods of unrest. "Reconfiguring the supply chain on short notice is an exceptionally difficult optimization problem, which restricts the agility of global trade," said Alicia Magann, a Truman Fellow at Sandia. She has led the development of a new way to design programs on quantum computers, which she and her team think could be especially useful for solving these kinds of massive optimization problems someday in the future when quantum technology becomes more mature. The Sandia team recently published the new approach in two joint papers in the journals Physical Review Letters and Physical Review A."</em> <a href="https://newsreleases.sandia.gov/supply_chain/">[...]</a>

Once he arrived at Purdue, he intended to expand on the model, expecting it to be relatively easy. He gave the seemingly straightforward calculations to Guangjie Li, a graduate student working with Vayrynen, but the calculations yielded an unexpected result. These results were a surprising roadblock which nearly brought their research to a screeching halt.

<p><em>"Advances in computing power over the decades have come thanks in part to our ability to make smaller and smaller transistors, a building block of electronic devices, but we are nearing the limit of the silicon materials typically used. A new technique for creating 2D oxide materials may pave the way for future high-speed electronics, according to an international team of scientists. “One way we can make our transistors, our electronic devices, work faster is to shrink the distance electrons have to travel between point A and B,” said Joshua Robinson, professor of materials science and engineering at Penn State. “You can only go so far with 3D materials like silicon — once you shrink it down to a nanometer, its properties change. So there’s been a massive push looking at new materials, one of which are 2D materials.” The team, led by Furkan Turker, graduate student in the Department of Materials Sciences, used a technique called confinement hetroepitaxy, or CHet, to create 2D oxides, materials with special properties that can serve as an atomically thin insulating layer between layers of electrically conducting materials. “Now we can create essentially the world’s thinnest oxides — just a few atoms thick,” Turker said."</em> <a href="https://www.psu.edu/news/research/story/two-dimensional-oxides-open-door-high-speed-electronics/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers from Japan provide a novel theoretical framework for describing the quark-gluon plasma, which agrees better with experimental data The properties of quark-gluon plasma (QGP), the primordial form of matter in the early universe, is conventionally described using relativistic hydrodynamical models. However, these models predict low particle yields in the low transverse momentum region, which is at odds with experimental data. To address this discrepancy, researchers from Japan now propose a novel framework based on a “core-corona” picture of QGP, which predicts that the corona component may contribute to the observed high particle yields. Research in fundamental science has revealed the existence of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) – a newly identified state of matter – as the constituent of the early universe. Known to have existed a microsecond after the Big Bang, the QGP, essentially a soup of quarks and gluons, cooled down with time to form hadrons like protons and neutrons – the building blocks of all matter. One way to reproduce the extreme conditions prevailing when QGP existed is through relativistic heavy-ion collisions."</em> <a href="https://www.sophia.ac.jp/eng/article/news/release/press20230213/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Get started with seeed static human presence sensor Well, this project is a by product. I wanted to recreate one of my projects buddy by replacing AK9753 - Human Presence Sensor with low cost 24GHz mmWave Sensor - Human Static Presence. When I was receive the sensor from Seeed, I wanted to quickly test it's accuracy to evaluate if it will fit my use case. Unfortunately, I was not satisfied with the reading out of the box. Then I got in touch with Seeed engineers who recommended to make some adjustment to the sensor based on my room. With those changes, I got pretty good readings."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/mithun-das/working-with-mr24hpc1-281d88">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Towards Spatial-guided Vision based Assistive Robotics using EdgeImpulse and LEGO Mindstorms. Problem Statement The ability to feed oneself is a crucial aspect of daily living, and losing this ability can have a significant impact on a person's life. Robotics has the potential to assist with this task. The development of a successful robotic assistive feeding system depends on its ability to acquire bites of food accurately, time the bites appropriately, and transfer the bites easily in both individual and group dining settings. However, the task of automating bite acquisition is challenging due to the vast variety of foods, utensils, and human strategies involved, as well as the need for robust manipulation of a deformable and hard-to-model target. Bite timing, especially in social dining settings, requires a delicate balance of multiple forms of communication, such as gaze, facial expressions, gestures, and speech, as well as action and sometimes coercion."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/503542/gelare-depth-sensing-edgeimpulse-powered-assistive-robots-491700">[...]</a>
