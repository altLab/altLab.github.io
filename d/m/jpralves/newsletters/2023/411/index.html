<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1789, o físico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Ohm">Georg Ohm</a>. Ele mostrou por experiência (1825) que não existem condutores eléctricos "perfeitos". Todos os condutores têm alguma resistência. Ele declarou a famosa lei de Ohm (1826), agora escrita como: "Se a dada temperatura permanecer constante, a corrente que flui através de certos condutores é proporcional à diferença potencial (voltagem) através dela" ou V=iR.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1821, o matemático alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduard_Heine">Eduard Heine</a>. Ele é responsável por contribuições sobre equações diferenciais parciais, a teoria do calor, soma de séries, fracções contínuas e funções elípticas. Heine também trabalhou em polinómios de Legendre, funções de Lamé e funções de Bessel. Ele continua conhecido pelo teorema de Heine-Borel, que pode ser dado de uma forma simplificada como "um subconjunto dos reais é compacto se e só se for fechado e delimitado". Heine formulou também o conceito de continuidade uniforme.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1836, o engenheiro e inventor anglo-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Smith_Hallidie">Andrew Smith Hallidie</a>. Ele construiu o sistema de teleférico utilizado pela primeira vez nas íngremes colinas das ruas de São Francisco (1 de Agosto de 1873). Os bondes sobre carris foram equipados com um dispositivo mecânico que agarrava um cabo em movimento sem fim subterrâneo para viajar e soltava para parar. O cabo passava ao redor de roldanas e era conduzido por uma grande roda numa casa de máquinas. Tinha aprendido o negócio de fazer cabos de arame com o seu pai antes de se mudar para os EUA (1853), onde concebeu e construiu pontes e calhas suspensas de arame. Começou a fabricar corda de arame em 1857. Hallidie também desenvolveu um método de movimentação de carga sobre desfiladeiros usando um cabo de aço sem fim, e invenções para a transmissão de energia com cabo de aço, o que semeou a sua ideia para os teleféricos.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1846, o matemático sueco <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6sta_Mittag-Leffler">Magnus Gösta Mittag-Leffler</a>. Ele fundou a revista internacional de matemática Acta Mathematica e cujas contribuições para a investigação matemática ajudaram a fazer avançar a escola escandinava de matemática. Mittag-Leffler fez numerosas contribuições para a análise matemática (preocupada com limites e incluindo cálculo, geometria analítica e teoria da probabilidade). Trabalhou na teoria geral das funções, relativa às relações entre variáveis independentes e dependentes. O seu trabalho mais conhecido dizia respeito à representação analítica de uma função de valor único, este trabalho culminou no teorema de Mittag-Leffler.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1853, o físico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Kayser">Heinrich Kayser</a>. Ele descobriu a presença de hélio na atmosfera da Terra. Antes disso, os cientistas tinham detectado hélio apenas no sol e em alguns minerais. O primeiro trabalho de investigação de Kayser foi sobre as propriedades do som. Em colaboração com o físico e matemático Carl D.T. Runge, Kayser mapeou cuidadosamente os espectros de um grande número de elementos. Ele escreveu um manual de espectroscopia (1901-12) e um tratado sobre a teoria dos electrões (1905).</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1915, o matemático japonês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunihiko_Kodaira">Kunihiko Kodaira</a>. Ele recebeu a Medalha Fields em 1954 pelo seu trabalho em geometria algébrica e análise complexa. O trabalho de Kodaira inclui aplicações dos métodos espaciais de Hilbert a equações diferenciais que foi um tópico importante no seu trabalho inicial e foi em grande parte o resultado da influência de Weyl. Através da influência de Hodge, ele também trabalhou em integrais harmónicos e mais tarde aplicou este trabalho a problemas em geometria algébrica. Outra área importante do trabalho de Kodaira foi a aplicação de roldanas à geometria algébrica. Por volta de 1960, envolveu-se na classificação de espaços analíticos compactos e complexos. Um dos temas que percorre grande parte do seu trabalho é o teorema de Riemann-Roch. Ganhou o Prémio Wolf de 1985.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1918, o físico americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Reines">Frederick Reines</a>. Ele recebeu o Prémio Nobel da Física de 1995 pela sua detecção em 1956 de neutrinos, trabalhando com o seu colega Clyde L. Cowan, Jr. O neutrino é uma partícula subatómica, um pequeno leptão com pouca ou nenhuma massa e uma carga neutra que tinha sido postulada por Wolfgang Pauli no início da década de 1930, mas que anteriormente permanecera por descobrir. (Reines partilhou o Prémio Nobel com o físico Martin Lewis Perl, que descobriu o tau lepton).</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1944, o cientista da computação americano-holandês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_S._Tanenbaum">Andrew S. Tanenbaum</a>. Ele é o autor de MINIX, um sistema operativo livre tipo Unix para fins de ensino, e escreveu múltiplos livros de informática considerados como textos padrão na área. Considera o seu trabalho de ensino como a sua obra mais importante. O seu livro, Sistemas Operativos: Design e Implementação e MINIX foram a inspiração de Linus Torvalds para o kernel Linux.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1953, o activista e programador americano do movimento do software livre <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman">Richard Stallman</a>. Ele lançou o Projecto GNU em Setembro de 1983 para escrever um sistema operativo de computador do tipo Unix composto inteiramente de software livre. Com isto, lançou também o movimento do software livre. Ele tem sido o principal arquitecto e organizador do Projecto GNU, e desenvolveu uma série de peças de software GNU amplamente utilizadas, incluindo, entre outros, a Colecção de Compiladores GNU, o GNU Debugger, e o editor de texto GNU Emacs. Ele foi pioneiro no conceito de copyleft, que utiliza os princípios do direito de autor para preservar o direito de utilizar, modificar, e distribuir software livre. Ele é o principal autor de licenças de software livre que descrevem esses termos, mais notavelmente a GNU General Public License (GPL), a licença de software livre mais amplamente utilizada.</p>

<p><em>"In a first, scientists have seen direct evidence of active volcanism on Earth’s twin, setting the stage for the agency’s VERITAS mission to investigate. Direct geological evidence of recent volcanic activity has been observed on the surface of Venus for the first time. Scientists made the discovery after poring over archival radar images of Venus taken more than 30 years ago, in the 1990s, by NASA’s Magellan mission. The images revealed a volcanic vent changing shape and increasing significantly in size in less than a year. Scientists study active volcanoes to understand how a planet’s interior can shape its crust, drive its evolution, and affect its habitability. One of NASA’s new missions to Venus will do just that."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-magellan-data-reveals-volcanic-activity-on-venus">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://toshiba.semicon-storage.com/ap-en/company/news/news-topics/2023/03/automotive-20230316-1.html">Toshiba to Provide Samples of Clock Extension Peripheral Interface Driver/Receiver IC That Contributes to Wiring Harnesses Reduction</a></h2>

<p><em>"Toshiba Electronic Devices &amp; Storage Corporation ("Toshiba") will this month start to provide test samples of “TB9032FNG,” an automotive driver/receiver IC for the physical layer interface defined in the Clock Extension Peripheral Interface (CXPI) [1] , the standard for automotive communications protocols. The electrification of automobiles is increasing the number of electronic components in automotive systems, adding to their complexity, and also to vehicle weight, as more wiring harnesses are required. The solution to this issue lies in changing the current system, where a human machine interface (HMI) [2] connects switches and sensors in a one-to-one manner, for a system that uses multiplex transmission in-vehicle communications to reduce wiring harnesses. HMI integrates an area network (CAN) [3] and a local interconnect network (LIN) [4]; the former is costly, the latter lacks responsiveness. CXPI, the in-vehicle communications protocols developed in Japan, and now adopted as an international standard, includes in-vehicle subnetworks that cost less than CAN and that are more responsive than LIN. TB9032FNG combines Motor Driver IC and CXPI communications, and provides as a network interface for in-vehicle body applications, or as an interface for zone electronic control units (ECUs) [5]."</em> <a href="https://toshiba.semicon-storage.com/ap-en/company/news/news-topics/2023/03/automotive-20230316-1.html">[...]</a>

The results, just published in Physical Review Letters, come from RHIC’s STAR detector, one of two large particle tracking experiments at this U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science user facility for nuclear physics research. The data on upsilons add further evidence that the quarks and gluons that make up the hot matter—which is known as a quark-gluon plasma (QGP)—are “deconfined,” or free from their ordinary existence locked inside other particles such as protons and neutrons. The findings will help scientists learn about the properties of the QGP, including its temperature. “By measuring the level of upsilon suppression or dissociation we can infer the properties of the QGP,” said Rongrong Ma, a physicist at DOE’s Brookhaven National Laboratory, where RHIC is located, and Physics Analysis Coordinator for the STAR collaboration. “We can’t tell exactly what the average temperature of the QGP is based solely on this measurement, but this measurement is an important piece of a bigger picture."</em> <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=121097">[...]</a>

This unexpected effect is likely to be present in all two-dimensional materials, which are all inherently non-flat. The Manchester team in collaboration with researchers from China and USA conducted a series of experiments to show that non-flatness of graphene makes it a strong catalyst. First, using ultrasensitive gas flow measurements and Raman spectroscopy, they demonstrated that graphene’s nanoscale corrugations were linked to its chemical reactivity with molecular hydrogen (H2) and that the activation energy for its dissociation into atomic hydrogen (H) was relatively small.

Robots could potentially do the heavy lifting by laying cables, deploying solar panels, erecting communications towers, and building habitats. But if each robot is designed for a specific action or task, a moon base could become overrun by a zoo of machines, each with its own unique parts and protocols. To avoid a bottleneck of bots, a team of MIT engineers is designing a kit of universal robotic parts that an astronaut could easily mix and match to rapidly configure different robot “species” to fit various missions on the moon. Once a mission is completed, a robot can be disassembled and its parts used to configure a new robot to meet a different task."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/mixed-robot-kit-lunar-exploration-0314">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Physicists at the University of Cincinnati are learning more about the bizarre behavior of “strange metals,” which operate outside the normal rules of electricity. Theoretical physicist Yashar Komijani, an assistant professor in UC’s College of Arts and Sciences, contributed to an international experiment using a strange metal made from an alloy of ytterbium, a rare earth metal. Physicists in a lab in Hyogo, Japan, fired radioactive gamma rays at the strange metal to observe its unusual electrical behavior. Led by Hisao Kobayashi with the University of Hyogo and RIKEN, the study was published in the journal Science. The experiment revealed unusual fluctuations in the strange metal’s electrical charge. “The idea is that in a metal, you have a sea of electrons moving in the background on a lattice of ions,” Komijani said."</em> <a href="https://www.uc.edu/news/articles/2023/03/uc-physicist-explores-mysteries-of-strange-metals.html">[...]</a>

This advance, published in Nature Electronics, marks a breakthrough in softbotics and the fields of robotics, electronics, and medicine. At Carnegie Mellon University, softbotics represents a new generation of soft machines and robots manufactured by multi-functional materials that have integrated sensing, actuation, and intelligence. The research team introduced the material, a liquid-metal filled organogel composite with high electrical conductivity, low stiffness, high stretchability, and self-healing properties in three applications: - damage-resistant snail-inspired robot - modular circuit to power a toy car - reconfigurable bioelectrode to measure muscle activity on different locations of the body "This is the first soft material that can maintain a high-enough electrical conductivity to support digital electronics and power-hungry devices," said lead author Carmel Majidi, Professor of Mechanical Engineering. "We have demonstrated you can actually power motors with it."

<p><em>"Experiments reveal link between intertwined states in ‘kagome’ metal Physicists were surprised by the 2022 discovery that electrons in magnetic iron-germanium crystals could spontaneously and collectively organize their charges into a pattern featuring a standing wave. Magnetism also arises from the collective self-organization of electron spins into ordered patterns, and those patterns rarely coexist with the patterns that produce the standing wave of electrons physicists call a charge density wave. In a study published this week in Nature Physics, Rice University physicists Ming Yi and Pengcheng Dai, and many of their collaborators from the 2022 study, present an array of experimental evidence that shows their charge density wave discovery was rarer still, a case where the magnetic and electronic orders don’t simply coexist but are directly linked. “We found magnetism subtly modifies the landscape of electron energy states in the material in a way that both promotes and prepares for the formation of the charge density wave,” said Yi, a co-corresponding author of the study. The study was co-authored by more than a dozen researchers from Rice; Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL); SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL); the University of Washington; the University of California, Berkeley; Israel’s Weizmann Institute of Science; and China’s Southern University of Science and Technology.

<p><em>"A new process that lets scientists chemically cut apart and stitch together nanoscopic layers of two-dimensional materials — like a tailor altering a suit — could be just the tool for designing the technology of a sustainable energy future. Researchers from Drexel University, China and Sweden, have developed a method for structurally splitting, editing and reconstituting layered materials, called MAX phases and MXenes, with the potential of producing new materials with very unusual compositions and exceptional properties. A “chemical scissor” is a chemical designed to react with a specific compound to break a chemical bond. The original set of chemical scissors, designed to break carbon-hydrogen bonds in organic molecules, was reported more than a decade ago. In a paper recently published in Science, the international team reported on a method to sharpen the scissors so that they can cut through extremely strong and stable layered nanomaterials in a way that breaks atomic bonds within a single atomic plane, then substitutes new elements — fundamentally altering the material’s composition in a single chemical “snip.” “This research opens a new era of materials science, enabling atomistic engineering of two-dimensional and layered materials,” said Yury Gogotsi, PhD, Distinguished University professor and Bach chair in Drexel’s College of Engineering, who was an author of the research. “We are showing a way to assemble and disassemble these materials like LEGO blocks, which will lead to the development of exciting new materials that have not even been predicted to be able to exist until now.” Gogotsi and his collaborators at Drexel have been studying the properties of a family of layered nanomaterials called MXenes, that they discovered in 2011."</em> <a href="https://drexel.edu/news/archive/2023/March/chemical-scissors-MXene-MAX-phases">[...]</a>

The results were published on 15 March in the Journal of Physical Chemistry C. Organic solar cells are thinner than classic silicon-based cells and they are flexible and probably easier to manufacture. To improve their efficiency, it is important to understand how charges travel through the polymer film.

<p><em>"I have designed a safety system for remote controls that immediately turns off the vehicle when the operator puts down the remote control Introduction My experience in the field of mobile robotics put me in front of different critical situations in which a correct use of a remote control device for the driving of a robot would have avoided some accidents. Fortunately I have not lived extreme situations, but I have understood the importance of safety in the workplace. All employees have the right to work in a safe environment, in which all health and safety risks are managed to prevent dangerous and harmful situations. Safety of workers should be considered a priority for the employers, not only because unsafe workplaces, injuries and work-related diseases can have serious legal and financial consequences and can damage the company's image and reputation, but also because the employers have a moral obligation towards workers: it’s a duty and moral responsibility of the company to keep employees safe and healthy in the workplace. Of course, we are all aware that total safety does not exist “even by staying in your bed at home”, but precautions must be taken to safeguard the life of the workers and ensure a work environment as much as possible without dangers. Employers have primary duty to ensure all health and safety requirements are met, however, all employees also play a crucial role in this: everyone is responsible for himself and others in the workplace; health and safety in the workplace is everyone’s responsibility."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/MarioSoranno/everyday-work-safety-651ba2">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/sn-lab/mouseVRheadset">mouseVRheadset</a></h2>

<p><em>"The mouseVRheadset is a VR system for mouse neuroscience and behavior research. By positioning the headset to the eyes of a head-fixed mouse running on a treadmill, virtual scenes can be displayed to the mouse in both closed-loop (treadmill motion controls the visual scene) and open-loop (visual scenes unaffected by movement) modes. The headset is powered by a Raspberry Pi 4, Godot video game engine, and a custom display driver for controlling each eye's display. A 3D printed case holds the Raspberry Pi and display eyepieces -- each eyepiece containing a circular display and Fresnel lens to cover a wide field-of-view (~70 deg solid angle) of the mouse eye and put the visual scene at a focal length of [approximately] infinity. The heart of the mouseVRheadset is a Raspberry Pi 4 running the Godot video game engine. Since the displays are relatively low resolution (240x210), an inexpensive single-board computer like a Raspberry Pi 4 is all that's needed to effectively render visual scenes at high (>60 fps) framerates."</em> <a href="https://github.com/sn-lab/mouseVRheadset">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The scope/goal of this project was to create a picture frame enclosing an e-paper device which plays movies in a very slow manner. This project was inspired by Tom Whitwell's Very Slow Movie Player which I have read about on Hackaday. Ever since, I wanted to create my own. So, eventually, I did. To achieve the goal, a Waveshare 10.3 inch 16 gray scale color e-paper device and a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W with Raspberry Pi OS for operating system were chosen. While the software can be modified to run on different hardware and operating systems, doing so is out of the scope of this project."</em> <a href="https://github.com/szantaii/slow-movie-frame-10.3">[...]</a>
