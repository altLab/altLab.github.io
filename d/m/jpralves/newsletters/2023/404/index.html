<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1832, o cirurgião e inventor norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rufus_Henry_Gilbert">Rufus Henry Gilbert</a>. Ele desempenhou um papel importante no desenvolvimento do trânsito rápido na cidade de Nova Iorque. Depois de servir como cirurgião no Exército Federal na Guerra Civil, interessou-se pelo trânsito rápido como meio de libertar as pessoas de viverem nos cortiços insalubres e apinhados nos centros das grandes cidades. Gilbert obteve duas patentes em 1870 sobre um sistema de tubos pneumáticos, e incorporou a Gilbert Electric Railway Company a 17 de Junho de 1872, para construir linhas elevadas na cidade de Nova Iorque. Os carros seriam propulsionados por pressão de ar de tubos pneumáticos montados na estrutura elevada. Uma depressão financeira atrasou a construção até 1876, e obrigou à adopção de uma via convencional com comboios puxados por locomotivas a vapor, que abriu a 6 de Junho de 1878.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1909, o químico escocês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_King_(scientist)">Alexander King</a>. Ele foi pioneiro na sensibilização ambiental, alertando para os perigos que o desenvolvimento industrial extensivo representa para o ambiente. Ele co-comissionou o relatório Limites ao Crescimento de 1972, que iniciou a atenção internacional às preocupações ambientais. Continua a ser um dos livros mais vendidos do mundo sobre o ambiente. Depois de dirigir a investigação científica como parte do esforço de guerra na II Guerra Mundial, voltou-se para a aplicação da ciência para a melhoria da vida. Em particular, foi cientista chefe no departamento de investigação científica e industrial (1950-56), trabalhando para ajudar as fábricas britânicas a tornarem-se mais produtivas. Após a publicação de Limites ao Crescimento, co-fundou o Clube de Roma, um grupo de reflexão centrado na forma de estabelecer um desenvolvimento sustentável. Foi o presidente desse grupo em 1984-90.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1911, o físico germano-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polykarp_Kusch">Polykarp Kusch</a>. Ele partilhou o Prémio Nobel da Física em 1955 pela sua determinação precisa de que o momento magnético do electrão é maior do que o seu valor teórico. Isto ele deduziu ao pesquisar a estrutura hiperfina dos níveis energéticos em certos elementos, e em 1947 encontrou uma discrepância de cerca de 0,1% entre o valor observado e o previsto pela teoria. Embora minuciosa, esta anomalia foi de grande significado e levou a teorias revistas sobre as interacções dos electrões com a radiação electromagnética, agora conhecida como electrodinâmica quântica. (Partilhou o prémio com Willis E. Lamb, Jr., que realizou experiências independentes mas relacionadas na Universidade de Columbia sobre a estrutura hiperfina do átomo de hidrogénio).</p>

<p>O Asteróide 2023 BU tem aproximadamente o tamanho de um camião e prevê-se que faça uma das aproximações mais próximas por um objecto próximo da Terra alguma vez registado. Nesta quinta-feira, 26 de Janeiro, um pequeno asteróide próximo da Terra terá um encontro muito próximo com o nosso planeta. Designado 2023 BU, o asteróide vai fazer zoom sobre a ponta sul da América do Sul por volta das 16:27 PST (19:27 p.m. EST) apenas 3.600 quilómetros acima da superfície do planeta e bem dentro da órbita dos satélites geossíncronos.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker e alguns vídeos interessantes. É apresentado a MagPI nº126 de Fevereiro.</p>

<p><em>"Asteroid 2023 BU is about the size of a box truck and is predicted to make one of the closest approaches by a near-Earth object ever recorded. On Thursday, Jan. 26, a small near-Earth asteroid will have a very close encounter with our planet. Designated 2023 BU, the asteroid will zoom over the southern tip of South America at about 4:27 p.m. PST (7:27 p.m. EST) only 2,200 miles (3,600 kilometers) above the planet’s surface and well within the orbit of geosynchronous satellites. There is no risk of the asteroid impacting Earth. But even if it did, this small asteroid – estimated to be 11.5 to 28 feet (3.5 to 8.5 meters) across – would turn into a fireball and largely disintegrate harmlessly in the atmosphere, with some of the bigger debris potentially falling as small meteorites. The asteroid was discovered by amateur astronomer Gennadiy Borisov, discoverer of the interstellar comet 2I/Borisov, from his MARGO observatory in Nauchnyi, Crimea, on Saturday, Jan. 21."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasa-system-predicts-small-asteroid-to-pass-close-by-earth-this-week">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The New Gate Driver IC Supports 1200V Power Devices with 3.75kVrms in Isolation Voltage. Renesas Electronics Corporation (TSE: 6723), a premier supplier of advanced semiconductor solutions, today announced a new gate driver IC that is designed to drive high-voltage power devices such as IGBTs (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors) and SiC (Silicon Carbide) MOSFETs for electric vehicle (EV) inverters. Gate driver ICs are essential components to EV inverters, providing an interface between the inverter control MCU and the IGBTs and SiC MOSFETs that deliver power to the inverter. They receive control signals from the MCU in the low-voltage domain and transfer these signals to rapidly turn power devices on and off in the high-voltage domain. To accommodate the higher voltages of EV batteries, the RAJ2930004AGM has a built-in 3.75kVrms (kV root mean square) isolator, which is higher than the 2.5kVrms isolator in the previous generation product, and can support power devices with a withstand voltage of up to 1200V. In addition, the new driver IC boasts superior CMTI (Common Mode Transient Immunity) performance at 150 V/ns (nanosecond) or higher, providing reliable communication and increased noise immunity while meeting the high voltages and fast switching speeds required in inverter systems."</em> <a href="https://www.renesas.com/eu/en/about/press-room/renesas-introduces-new-gate-driver-ic-igbts-and-sic-mosfets-driving-ev-inverters">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scientists have discovered the first gamma-ray eclipses from a special type of binary star system using data from NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. These so-called spider systems each contain a pulsar – the superdense, rapidly rotating remains of a star that exploded in a supernova – that slowly erodes its companion. An international team of scientists scoured over a decade of Fermi observations to find seven spiders that undergo these eclipses, which occur when the low-mass companion star passes in front of the pulsar from our point of view. The data allowed them to calculate how the systems tilt relative to our line of sight and other information. “One of the most important goals for studying spiders is to try to measure the masses of the pulsars,” said Colin Clark, an astrophysicist at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Hannover, Germany, who led the work. “Pulsars are basically balls of the densest matter we can measure."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2023/nasa-s-fermi-detects-first-gamma-ray-eclipses-from-spider-star-systems">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/feature/nasa-validates-revolutionary-propulsion-design-for-deep-space-missions">NASA Validates Revolutionary Propulsion Design for Deep Space Missions</a></h2>

<p><em>"As NASA takes its first steps toward establishing a long-term presence on the Moon’s surface, a team of propulsion development engineers at NASA have developed and tested NASA’s first full-scale rotating detonation rocket engine, or RDRE, an advanced rocket engine design that could significantly change how future propulsion systems are built. The RDRE differs from a traditional rocket engine by generating thrust using a supersonic combustion phenomenon known as a detonation. This design produces more power while using less fuel than today’s propulsion systems and has the potential to power both human landers and interplanetary vehicles to deep space destinations, such as the Moon and Mars. Engineers at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, and primary collaborator IN Space LLC, located in West Lafayette, Indiana, are confirming data from RDRE hot fire tests conducted in 2022 at Marshall’s East Test Area. The engine was fired over a dozen times, totaling nearly 10 minutes in duration. The RDRE achieved its primary test objective by demonstrating that its hardware – made from novel additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, designs and processes – could operate for long durations while withstanding the extreme heat and pressure environments generated by detonations."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/feature/nasa-validates-revolutionary-propulsion-design-for-deep-space-missions">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Computer scientists want to know the exact limits in our ability to clean up, and reconstruct, partly blurred images. In science and technology, there has been a long and steady drive toward improving the accuracy of measurements of all kinds, along with parallel efforts to enhance the resolution of images. An accompanying goal is to reduce the uncertainty in the estimates that can be made, and the inferences drawn, from the data (visual or otherwise) that have been collected. Yet uncertainty can never be wholly eliminated. And since we have to live with it, at least to some extent, there is much to be gained by quantifying the uncertainty as precisely as possible. Expressed in other terms, we’d like to know just how uncertain our uncertainty is."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/putting-clear-bounds-uncertainty-0123">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Forty years ago today, physicists at CERN announced to the world that they had discovered the electrically charged carrier of the weak force, one of nature’s four fundamental forces Exactly four decades ago today, on 25 January 1983, physicists at CERN announced to the world that they had observed a new elementary particle – the W boson. Together with its electrically neutral counterpart, the Z boson, which was discovered later in the same year, the electrically charged W boson mediates the weak force, one of nature’s four fundamental forces. Through this force, the W boson enables the nuclear fusion reaction that powers the Sun, without which life as we know it would not be possible. The W boson is also responsible for a form of radioactivity, called radioactive beta decay, that is widely used in medicine. The W boson’s discovery was the result of an idea proposed in 1976 by Carlo Rubbia, Peter McIntyre and David Cline. The trio of physicists suggested converting CERN’s largest accelerator at the time, the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS), from an accelerator of protons into a machine to collide protons and antiprotons (the protons’ antimatter equivalents) at a high enough energy to produce W and Z bosons."</em> <a href="https://home.web.cern.ch/news/news/physics/w-boson-turns-40">[...]</a>

Similar to what occurs in neural networks, the researchers were able to show the existence of memory in two-dimensional channels which are similar to atomic-scale tunnels with heights varying from several nanometers down to angstroms (10-10 m). This was done using simple salts (including table salt) dissolved in water flowing through nanochannels and by the application of voltage (&lt; 1 V) scans/pulses. The study spotlights the importance of the recent development of ultrathin nanochannels."</em> <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/graphene-researchers-discover-long-term-memory-in-2d-nanofluidic-channels/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"PNNL scientists carve a path to profit from carbon capture through carbon upcycling, unlock crucial step in decarbonization and advancing toward net zero emissions The need for technology that can capture, remove and repurpose carbon dioxide grows stronger with every CO2 molecule that reaches Earth’s atmosphere. To meet that need, scientists at the Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory have cleared a new milestone in their efforts to make carbon capture more affordable and widespread. They have created a new system that efficiently captures CO2—the least costly to date—and converts it into one of the world’s most widely used chemicals: methanol. Snaring CO2 before it floats into the atmosphere is a key component in slowing global warming. Creating incentives for the largest emitters to adopt carbon capture technology, however, is an important precursor. The high cost of commercial capture technology is a longstanding barrier to its widespread use."</em> <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/news-media/scientists-unveil-least-costly-carbon-capture-system-date">[...]</a>

It was believed that Hall thrusters, an efficient kind of electric propulsion widely used in orbit, need to be large to produce a lot of thrust. Now, a new study from the University of Michigan suggests that smaller Hall thrusters can generate much more thrust—potentially making them candidates for interplanetary missions. “People had previously thought that you could only push a certain amount of current through a thruster area, which in turn translates directly into how much force or thrust you can generate per unit area,” said Benjamin Jorns, U-M associate professor of aerospace engineering who led the new Hall thruster study to be presented at the AIAA SciTech Forum in National Harbor, Maryland, today. His team challenged this limit by running a 9 kilowatt Hall thruster up to 45 kilowatts, maintaining roughly 80% of its nominal efficiency.

In natural photosynthesis, CO2 is not reduced directly, but is bound to organic compounds which are converted to glucose or starch. Mimicking this, artificial photosynthesis could reduce CO2 by combining it into organic compounds to be used as raw materials, which can be converted into durable forms such as plastic. A research team led by Professor Yutaka Amao from the Research Center for Artificial Photosynthesis and graduate student Mika Takeuchi, from the Osaka Metropolitan University Graduate School of Science, have succeeded in synthesizing fumaric acid from CO2, a raw material for plastics, powered -- for the first time -- by sunlight. Their findings were published in Sustainable Energy &amp; Fuels. Fumaric acid is typically synthesized from petroleum, to be used as a raw material for making biodegradable plastics such as polybutylene succinate, but this discovery shows that fumaric acid can be synthesized from CO2 and biomass-derived compounds using renewable solar energy."</em> <a href="https://www.omu.ac.jp/en/info/research-news/entry-21875.html">[...]</a>

This allows the speed of any rotating object to be calculated by varying the pulse rate until the rotating object appears stationary. Once this state is achieved, revolutions per minute (rpm) of the rotating object can be calculated from the frequency of the pulsed light. If the object appears to be stationary when the pulsed light is at a frequency of 50Hz or 50 times a second, the object is rotating at 3,000 rpm (50 x 60).

New style MCP23017 Breakout – Top view There will not be a lot of obvious differences at first, but if we look closely, here are the changes:– In the old version, due to the size of the SOIC28 footprint, I had to place the bypass capacitors, as well as I2C pullup resistors on the bottom layer of the PCB. - The new design, using the more readily available ( at least where I live) SSOP28 footprint, leaves enough space for these components on the top layer, thus resulting in a mostly single-layer layout, with only a few tracks on the bottom layer. - I2C pull-up resistors can now be controlled by a jumper, enabling or disabling them completely… This helps when adding a few devices to the I2C bus, and rather having the pull-up’s close to the MCU ( as is generally recommended anyway ) - Other cosmetic changes involve the separation of the data ports (A and B) from the interrupts, reset, Vcc and ground pins. On initial testing of this on a breadboard, it makes using the device a bit easier, and access to the io pins faster. ( In my biased opinion anyway ) Pinouts and connections I have tried to make all the connections easy to find and use, with the IO ports ( A and B) on opposite sides of the breakout, Numbered A7 to A0 on the top, and B7 to B0 on the bottom."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/MakerIoT2020/redesigned-mcp23017-breakout-e611a0">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Mathias Ferreira and David Flores, students of 'Creative Electronics', a Beng Electronics Engineering module at theUniversity of Mlaga, School of Telecommunications. What about to apply Arduino and electronics knowledge over an ancient invention as the hourglass is? Well, that is what we did for our Creative Electronics final project. We combined both ideas in order to improve and create a more attractive device. We give thanks to Edison Science Corner because they gave us a wide range of ideas about the Arduino Hourglass and we added some other improvements. The functioning consists in a led hourglass with gravity sensitivity, where we added the way to set up the time in minutes and seconds that the hourglass is working."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Hourglass/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"With being active in home automation for the last 5 years, Ive by now (like most of you) automated all my lights and put temperature and humidity sensors on more places than strictly necessary. So, it only logical next step in my home automation journey is.. automating my curtains! I quickly figured out that the off-the-shelf solutions are eitherexpensive,need chargingor simply dont exist for curtain rods. So the only logical step is to go the DIY route! Supplies - IKEA Bekräfta curtain rod - IKEA Betydlig wall bracket - IKEA Syrlig curtain rings (to reduce the friction of the curtain) - Curtains of your liking - 12v, 5A power supply (to power the ESP and motors) - LM2596S Step down converter (to power the ESP) - 2x Nema 17 ~3–4 N. cm stepper motors (I tried with one, but that wasn’t powerful enough to perform at the speed I’d like) - 1x ESP8266 such as the Wemos D1 Mini or NodeMCU - 2x A4988 Stepper drivers - 2x 100mF &amp; 2x 10mF capacitator - 2x GT2 16-tooth wheel bore (to use with the timing belt. I tried with a cable as well, but that would have insufficient grip) - 5 meters timing belt - 8x m3 bolts (to connect the stepper motor to the 3D print) - 4x m5 bolts (to connect the stepper motor mount to the wall brackets) - Cables to connect stepper motors (I used old network cables) - Dupont cables 3D printer for: - 1 timing belt clip, - 2 stepper motor mounts - 1 box for electronic - 1 lid"</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Smart-Home-Upgrade-Turn-Your-IKEA-Curtains-Int/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.instructables.com/Responsive-Soundbars-for-Speakers/">Responsive Soundbars for Speakers</a></h2>

<p><em>"Hi everyone, On this Instructables, I will explain how I manage to add responsive soundbars to my Z200 Logitech speaker. I think this project will work similarly on other types of speakers. The main idea is to fix the sound bars in my direction, but also to power them permanently. This project is non-destructive for the speakers, all can be disassembled invisibly. The soundbars are held to the speaker using magnets, so they can be easily removed for use elsewhere Check the end result on my desk at the end of this Instructables. To make the custom soundbars for your speaker you need : - 1x superglue - 1x flexible double-sided tape (at least 20mm wide) - 2x soundbar (with the USB type C cable) - In this Instructables, I got the rechargeable sound bar, but you can take the plug-in version - 6x D6xH2 magnets - 1x Z200 Logitech speakers - 7x printing parts Required tools : - A soldering iron - A 3D printer - A glue gun - Some screwdriver - A cutter - A pair of pliers - A wire stripper Optional tools : - A Dremel - A multimeter - A 3r hand - A vice"</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Responsive-Soundbars-for-Speakers/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The 8086 processor was introduced in 1978 and has greatly influenced modern computing through the x86 architecture. One unusual instruction in this processor is HLT, which stops the processor and puts it in a halt state. In this blog post, I explain in detail how the halt circuitry is implemented and how it interacts with the 8086's architecture. The die photo below shows the 8086 microprocessor under a microscope. The metal layer on top of the chip is visible, with the silicon and polysilicon mostly hidden underneath. Around the edges of the die, bond wires connect pads to the chip's 40 external pins."</em> <a href="http://www.righto.com/2023/01/reverse-engineering-intel-8086.html">[...]</a>
