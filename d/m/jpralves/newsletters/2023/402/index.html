<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1580, o Filósofo, químico, e médico belga <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Baptist_van_Helmont">Jan Baptista van Helmont</a>. Ele cunhou a palavra "gás" (via khaos grego, espaço vazio), do qual encontrou vários exemplos, a maioria dos quais é de dióxido de carbono natural. Como homem da sua idade, ele foi parte medievalista e parte cientista. Helmont foi o primeiro a reconhecer gases distintos do ar atmosférico. Ele determinou que o gás emitido pela queima do carvão vegetal é o mesmo que o emitido pela fermentação do sumo de uva. A isto deu o nome de spiritus silvestre ("espírito selvagem"); chamamos-lhe dióxido de carbono. Ele também identificou o sulfureto de hidrogénio proveniente do homem, e fez gás acis hidroclorídrico. Como médico e fisiologista, Helmont foi um dos primeiros a aplicar princípios químicos na saúde humana e na doença. Alguns chamam-lhe o "pai dabiochequímica". Ele foi interrogado pela Inquisição, e passou algum tempo em prisão domiciliária.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1716, o cientista e oficial naval espanhol <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_de_Ulloa">Antonio de Ulloa</a>. Ele descobriu o elemento platina (número atómico 78). Em 1735, os governos francês e espanhol enviaram uma expedição científica ao Peru e Equador para medir um grau de meridiano em Quinto, perto da linha do equador. Ulloa foi um dos oficiais nomeados para assumir o encargo da expedição. Em 1744, o navio em que regressou foi capturado pelos britânicos, e foi feito prisioneiro, embora tratado com respeito pelos oficiais navais ingleses, pois eles "não estavam em guerra com as artes e as ciências". O diário de bordo da sua viagem ao Peru, publicado em 1748, contém uma descrição da platina. Criou o primeiro museu de história natural e o primeiro laboratório metalúrgico em Espanha, assim como o observatório de Cádis.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1792, o químico sueco <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_August_Arfwedson">Johan August Arfwedson</a>. Ele descobriu lítio (relatado em 1818) num composto obtido a partir de petalite. Este mineral foi encontrado na mina de ferro de Uto, na Suécia. O componente alcalino, denominado lítio, era óxido de lítio. Arfwedson não conseguiu isolar o lítio como metal porque isso exigia electrólise com baterias mais fortes do que as que tinha disponíveis. (A separação acabou por ser feita por Humphry Davy.) Petalite é agora conhecida por ser silicato de lítio e alumínio. Posteriormente, descobriu também lítio em dois outros minerais, spodumene e lepidolite. Arfwedson abandonou o esforço científico para passar o seu tempo a gerir as fábricas e minas da sua família que ele herdou.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1822, o inventor belgo-francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tienne_Lenoir">Étienne Lenoir</a>. Ele concebeu o primeiro motor de combustão interna do mundo com sucesso comercial. Mudou-se para Paris, onde o seu trabalho com galvanização o levou a outras invenções eléctricas, entre as quais um telégrafo ferroviário. Lenoir patenteou o seu primeiro motor em 1860. Parecendo-se muito com um motor a vapor de dupla acção, disparou uma carga de ar não comprimido e gás iluminante com um sistema de ignição da sua própria concepção. Um destes motores alimentava um veículo rodoviário em 1863; outro dirigia um barco. Devido a desenhos melhorados por Nikolaus Otto e outros inventores, o motor Lenoir tornou-se obsoleto e apenas cerca de 500 motores Lenoir foram construídos. O motor Lenoir não era suficientemente eficiente, e o inventor morreu pobre.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1853, o matemático italiano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorio_Ricci-Curbastro">Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro</a>. Ele foi  instrumental no desenvolvimento do cálculo diferencial absoluto (também chamado cálculo Ricci), agora conhecido como análise tensorial. O trabalho inicial de Ricci-Curbastro foi em física matemática, particularmente sobre as leis dos circuitos eléctricos e equações diferenciais. Ele mudou um pouco de área para empreender investigação em geometria diferencial e foi o inventor do cálculo diferencial absoluto entre 1884 e 1894. O cálculo diferencial absoluto de Ricci-Curbastro tornou-se o fundamento da análise tensorial e foi utilizado por Einstein na sua teoria da relatividade geral.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1903, o físico nuclear soviético <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Kurchatov">Igor Kurchatov</a>. Ele conduziu investigação científica nuclear na União Soviética, durante a qual a sua equipa construiu um ciclotrão, um acelerador de prótons e estudou a radioactividade artificial e as interacções neutrões-protões. Durante a II Guerra Mundial, foi escolhido como director para o desenvolvimento da primeira bomba atómica do seu país, detonada a 29 de Agosto de 1949. Entretanto, em Dezembro de 1946, Kurchatov demonstrou um reactor protótipo em funcionamento, embora limitado a produzir apenas alguns watts e, em Junho de 1948, um reactor de produção de plutónio. Em poucos anos, ele produziu a primeira bomba termonuclear prática do mundo (1952). Antes de 1978, o nome soviético para o elemento-104 era kurchatovium (Ku), embora posteriormente o rutherfordium (Rf) se tenha tornado o nome aceite.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1907, o engenheiro de foguetes soviético <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Korolev">Sergei Korolev</a>. Ele concebeu mísseis guiados, foguetes e naves espaciais. Foi um dos fundadores do Grupo de Moscovo para o Estudo do Movimento Reactivo. Em 1933, participou no primeiro lançamento de um foguetão propulsor líquido da União Soviética. Como não era membro do Partido Comunista, passou grande parte da sua vida sob prisão domiciliária. Após demonstrar a sua perícia na modificação dos foguetes V2 capturados, Korolev dirigiu o projecto, testes, construção e lançamento da nave espacial Vostok, e a maioria dos outros projectos da R.E.U. Por volta de 1958, Korolev defendeu a perseguição de voos espaciais tripulados em vez de satélites de reconhecimento militar. Após muito debate, o projecto Vostok foi aprovado desde que o veículo de lançamento também pudesse ser útil para os militares.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1934, o inventor e empresário norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Fergason">James Fergason</a>. Ele é mais conhecido pelo seu trabalho sobre um ecrã de cristais líquidos melhorado, ou LCD. Detinha mais de uma centena de patentes americanas na altura da sua morte.</p>

<p>E nesta semana que passou foi lançada a nova família de câmaras para o Raspberry PI. São quatro as variantes diferentes do Módulo 3 da Câmara, a começar pelo preço de 25 dólares. Os Módulos de Câmara têm opções sensíveis à luz visível e infravermelhos, e com um campo de visão padrão ou largo (FoV). E em vez da óptica de focagem fixa dos seus antecessores, o Módulo de Câmara 3 fornece focagem automática motorizada - permitindo tirar imagens nítidas de objectos desde cerca de 5cm até ao infinito.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker e alguns vídeos interessantes. É apresentado o livro "Computational Imaging Book".</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/new-autofocus-camera-modules/">New autofocus camera modules!</a></h2>

<p><em>"Today, we’re happy to announce the launch of Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3. Four different variants of Camera Module 3, in fact, starting at the familiar price of $25. We’ve produced Camera Modules with both visible-light and infrared-sensitive options, and with either a standard or wide field of view (FoV). And in place of the fixed-focus optics of its predecessors, Camera Module 3 provides powered autofocus — which many of you have requested — allowing you to take crisp images of objects from around 5cm out to infinity. There’s a video demo further down the page. Once again, we’ve partnered with Sony, this time using their back-illuminated IMX708 sensor: this offers higher resolution (twelve megapixels); a larger and more sensitive pixel design; and support for high-dynamic-range imaging."</em> <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/new-autofocus-camera-modules/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The newly discovered planet and its Earth-size sibling are both in the habitable zone, where liquid water could potentially exist on their surfaces. Using data from NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, scientists have identified an Earth-size world, called TOI 700 e, orbiting within the habitable zone of its star – the range of distances where liquid water could occur on a planet’s surface. The world is 95% Earth’s size and likely rocky. Astronomers previously discovered three planets in this system, called TOI 700 b, c, and d. Planet d also orbits in the habitable zone. But scientists needed an additional year of TESS observations to discover TOI 700 e. “This is one of only a few systems with multiple, small, habitable-zone planets that we know of,” said Emily Gilbert, a postdoctoral fellow at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California who led the work. “That makes the TOI 700 system an exciting prospect for additional follow-up."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-tess-discovers-planetary-systems-second-earth-size-world">[...]</a>

NASA’s Lunar Flashlight mission successfully launched on Dec. 11, 2022, to begin its four-month journey to the Moon, where the small satellite, or SmallSat, will test several new technologies with a goal of looking for hidden surface ice at the lunar South Pole. While the SmallSat is largely healthy and communicating with NASA’s Deep Space Network, the mission operations team has discovered that three of its four thrusters are underperforming. The mission team, which first observed the reduced thrust three days after launch, is working to analyze the issue and provide possible solutions. During its cruise, Lunar Flashlight’s propulsion system has operated for short-duration pulses of up to a couple seconds at a time. Based on ground testing, the team thinks that the underperformance might be caused by obstructions in the fuel lines that may be limiting the propellant flow to the thrusters."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-lunar-flashlight-team-assessing-spacecrafts-propulsion-system">[...]</a>

It is important that surfaces remain highly transparent, even if fogging occurs, so that functionality is maintained.” In the Optica Publishing Group journal Applied Optics, Gärtner and colleagues describe how they combined a polymer coating that prevents fogging with porous silicon dioxide nanostructures that reduce reflections. Although the coatings described in the paper were designed specifically for lidar systems, the technology can be tailored for many different applications."</em> <a href="https://www.optica.org/en-us/about/newsroom/news_releases/2023/january/optical_coating_approach_prevents_fogging_and_unwa/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scientists at EPFL and Heriot-Watt University have developed a machine learning approach to accurately predict potentially harmful amine emissions from carbon-capturing plants. Global warming is partly due to the vast amount of carbon dioxide that we release, mostly from power generation and industrial processes, such as making steel and cement. For a while now, chemical engineers have been exploring carbon capture, a process that can separate carbon dioxide and store it in ways that keep it out of the atmosphere. This is done in dedicated carbon-capture plants, whose chemical process involves amines, compounds that are already used to capture carbon dioxide from natural gas processing and refining plants. Amines are also used in certain pharmaceuticals, epoxy resins, and dyes. The problem is that amines could also be potentially harmful to the environment as well as a health hazard, making it essential to mitigate their impact."</em> <a href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/using-machine-learning-to-forecast-amine-emissions/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scientists unveil a unified theory for rocky planet formation A new theory for how rocky planets form could explain the origin of so-called "super-Earths"—a class of exoplanets a few times more massive than the Earth that are the most abundant type of planet in the galaxy. Further, it could explain why super-Earths within a single planetary system often wind up looking strangely similar in size, as though each system were only capable of producing a single kind of planet. "As our observations of exoplanets have grown over the past decade, it has become clear that the standard theory of planet formation needs to be revised, starting with the fundamentals. We need a theory that can simultaneously explain the formation of the terrestrial planets in our solar system as well as the origins of self-similar systems of super-Earths, many of which appear rocky in composition," says Caltech professor of planetary science Konstantin Batygin (MS '10, PhD '12), who collaborated with Alessandro Morbidelli of the Observatoire de la Côte d'Azur in France on the new theory.

The research, led by Dr Queenie Chan, from the Department of Earth Sciences at Royal Holloway, University of London, found organic compounds from space which holds the secrets to the origin of life. In the study, the analysis found a range of organic matter which reveals that the meteorite was once from part of an asteroid where liquid water occurred, and if it that asteroid had been given access to the water, a chemical reaction could have occurred leading to more molecules turning into amino acids and protein - the building blocks of life. The Winchcombe meteorite is a rare carbon rich chondritic meteorite (approximately four percent of all recovered meteorites, containing up to 3.5 weight percent of carbon) and is the first ever meteorite of this type to be found in the UK with an observed meteorite fall event, with more than 1,000 eyewitnesses and numerous footages of the fireball. The amino acid abundance of Winchcombe is ten times lower than other types of carbonaceous chondritic meteorites and was a challenge to study due to the limited detection of amino acids, but with the meteorite so promptly recovered and curated, the team were able to study the organic content of the meteorite prior to its interaction with the Earth’s environment.

Some suggested the elusive bits of matter might be morphing into weirder, undetectable “sterile” neutrinos. Instead, new results pin down what other experiments had suggested: that theorists overestimated how many neutrinos a reactor should produce. “This is not a surprising result, but it’s an important one,” says Georgia Karagiorgi, a particle physicist at Columbia University who was not involved in the work. “It’s still something that I wanted to see.” Neutrinos come in three types—electron, muon, and tau—depending on how they’re produced. Electron neutrinos pour from the Sun, muon neutrinos rain from the sky as cosmic rays strike the atmosphere, and tau neutrinos emerge in the decay of tau particles, which can be created with atom smashers."</em> <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/nuclear-reactor-mystery-solved-no-need-new-particles">[...]</a>

The device opens up a world of potential applications in optics and telecommunications. Researchers led by Cristina Benea-Chelmus in the Laboratory of Hybrid Photonics (HYLAB) in EPFL’s School of Engineering have taken a big step toward successfully exploiting the so-called terahertz gap, which lies between about 300-30,000 gigahertz (0.3 to 30 THz) on the electromagnetic spectrum. This range is currently something of a technological dead zone, describing frequencies that are too fast for today’s electronics and telecommunications devices, but too slow for optics and imaging applications. Now, thanks to an extremely thin chip with an integrated photonic circuit made of lithium niobate, the HYLAB researchers and colleagues at ETH Zurich and Harvard University have succeeded not just in producing terahertz waves, but in engineering a solution for custom-tailoring their frequency, wavelength, amplitude, and phase. Such precise control over terahertz radiation means that it can now potentially be harnessed for next-generation applications in both the electronic and optical realms."</em> <a href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/integrated-photonic-circuits-could-help-close-the-/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The chemistry of planet formation has fascinated researchers for decades because the chemical reservoir in protoplanetary discs—the dust and gas from which planets form—directly impacts planet composition and potential for life. New research from the University of Michigan Department of Astronomy suggests that chemistry in late-stage planet development is fueled by ultraviolet rays, rather than cosmic rays or X-rays, and this new understanding provides a chemical signature that helps researchers trace exoplanets back to their cosmic nurseries in the planet-forming disks. Jenny Calahan, a doctoral student in astronomy and first author of the paper, which appears in Nature Astronomy, said the discovery was part happy accident, part building on previous work. “It has been shown that there are bright, complex organic molecules present in the coldest and densest parts of planet-forming disks,” Calahan said. “This bright emission has been puzzling because we expect these molecules to be frozen out at these temperatures, not in the gas where we can observe them.” These molecules are emitting from regions that are minus-400 degrees Fahrenheit, and at these temperatures they’re thought to be frozen onto tiny solids that astronomers label as dust grains, or for the later mm-to-cm-sized solids as pebbles. These molecules should add to an icy coating on the grains, so they cannot be observed in the gas."</em> <a href="https://news.umich.edu/shift-to-ultraviolet-driven-chemistry-in-planet-forming-disks-marks-beginning-of-late-stage-planet-formation/">[...]</a>

Out was the early 1900s model of a solar system in miniature, in which electrons looped around a solid nucleus.

These balloons are known as atomic orbitals, and they come in all sorts of different shapes—perfectly round, two-lobed, clover-leaf-shaped. The number of lobes in the balloon signifies how much the electron spins about the nucleus. That’s all well and good for individual atoms, but when atoms come together to form something solid—like a chunk of metal, say—the outermost electrons in the atoms can link arms and lose sight of the nucleus they came from, forming many oversized balloons that span the whole chunk of metal."</em> <a href="https://jqi.umd.edu/news/electrons-take-new-shape-inside-unconventional-metal">[...]</a>

But sometimes friction is bad -- if you did not put oil in that very same car, there would be so much friction in the bearings of the engine that the car could not operate. A material state known as super-lubricity, where friction between two contacting surfaces nearly vanishes, is a phenomenon that materials researchers have studied for years due to the potential for reducing the energy cost and wear and tear on devices, two major drawbacks of friction. However, there are times when friction is needed within the same device, and the ability to turn super-lubricity on and off would be a boon for multiple practical engineering applications.

<h2><a href="https://imagingtext.github.io/cibook.pdf">Computational Imaging Book</a></h2>

<p><em>"A comprehensive and up-to-date textbook and reference for computational imaging. Computational imaging involves the joint design of imaging hardware and computer algorithms to create novel imaging systems with unprecedented capabilities. In recent years such capabilities include cameras that operate at a trillion frames per second, microscopes that can see small viruses long thought to be optically irresolvable, and telescopes that capture images of black holes. This text offers a comprehensive and up-to-date introduction to this rapidly growing field, a convergence of vision, graphics, signal processing, and optics. It can be used as an instructional resource for computer imaging courses and as a reference for professionals. The text first presents an imaging toolkit, including optics, image sensors, and illumination, and a computational toolkit, introducing modeling, mathematical tools, model-based inversion, data-driven inversion techniques, and hybrid inversion techniques."</em> <a href="https://imagingtext.github.io/cibook.pdf">[...]</a>
