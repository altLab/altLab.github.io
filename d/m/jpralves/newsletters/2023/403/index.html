<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1736, o engenheiro e inventor escocês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Watt">James Watt</a>. Ele criou a máquina a vapor que contribuiu substancialmente para a Revolução Industrial. Em 1763 reparou o modelo da máquina a vapor Newcomen pertencente à Universidade de Glasgow, e iniciou experiências sobre as propriedades do vapor. O motor Newcomen era de concepção simples: actuava como uma bomba e um jacto de água fria era utilizado para condensar o vapor. Watt melhorou este design ao adicionar um condensador separado e um sistema de válvulas para fazer o pistão regressar ao topo do cilindro após a descida. Em 1769, ele levou uma patente para o condensador separado. Mais tarde, adaptou o motor ao movimento rotativo, tornando-o adequado para uma variedade de fins industriais, e inventou o volante de inércia e o regulador.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1747, o astrónomo alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Elert_Bode">Johann Elert Bode</a>. Ele ficou conhecido pela sua popularização da lei de Bode. Em 1766, o seu compatriota Johann Titius tinha descoberto uma curiosa relação matemática nas distâncias dos planetas em relação ao sol. Se a cada número da série 0, 3, 6, 12, 24,... e as respostas divididas por 10, a sequência resultante dá as distâncias dos planetas em unidades astronómicas (terra = 1). Também conhecida como a lei Titius-Bode, a ideia caiu em descrédito após a descoberta de Netuno, que não está em conformidade com a 'lei' - nem Plutão. Bode foi director no Observatório de Berlim, onde publicou Uranographia (1801), uma das primeiras tentativas bem sucedidas de mapear todas as estrelas visíveis a olho nu sem qualquer interpretação artística das figuras das constelações estelares.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1813, o industrialista, metalúrgico, inventor e engenheiro inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Bessemer">Henry Bessemer</a>. Ele desenvolveu o primeiro processo de fabrico de aço de forma barata (1856), levando ao desenvolvimento do conversor de Bessemer. Bessemer inventou o seu processo de fabrico de aço para resolver um problema específico que perturbava outra das suas invenções, a concha de artilharia autogravada. O conversor removeu as impurezas do ferro fundido por oxidação através do ar a ser soprado através do ferro fundido. A oxidação também aumentou a temperatura da massa de ferro, mantendo-a derretida. O processo de oxidação removeu impurezas tais como silício, manganês, e carbono como óxidos, que os óxidos ou escapam como gás ou formam uma escória sólida. Ele também resolveu problemas sobre a química dos minérios, combustíveis e aço. Detinha 110 patentes aquando da sua morte.</p>

<h2><a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4499.html">STMicroelectronics’ dual-channel digital isolators cover flexible configurations</a></h2>

<p><em>"STMicroelectronics has extended its family of dual-channel high-speed digital isolators, enhancing flexibility for designers to optimize their board layout. The new STISO620 contains two channels of the same directionality, having all digital inputs on one side of the isolation barrier and all digital outputs on the other side. It joins ST’s digital isolator lineup alongside the STISO621 and STISO621W that provide one channel in each direction. The family thus offers a convenient solution for many applications that need to isolate two digital signals and transfer the digital communication across the isolation barrier with flexible directionality. All the isolators are based on ST’s 6kV thick-oxide technology that ensures robust galvanic isolation. Built to maintain insulation integrity during system faults and with aging, they enhance reliability in industrial and consumer applications."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4499.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Manufacturer claims latest leap in size and power means machine can supply almost 100,000 people and slash build costs. Mingyang Smart Energy set out its stall to take China’s offshore wind industry to a new level of ultra-large turbines with its latest 140-metre-blade MySE 18.X-28X to “move beyond the 18MW threshold”. The giant machine, unveiled by the Chinese OEM today (Friday), boasts a rotor diameter above 280 metres and 66,000m2 swept area, said Mingyang as it joined compatriot CSSC Haizhuang at the 18MW mark and suggested there is more to come. The manufacturer claimed at an average 8.5 metres/second the turbine will generate 80GWh annually, enough to supply almost 100,000 people, in the latest in a seemingly endless string of announcements from China's wind industry seeking to push the boundaries of technology in the sector. “When compared to the installation of 13MW models, the higher output of the MySE18.X-28X would save 18 units required for a 1GW wind farm, shaving off construction costs by $120,000-150,000 per megawatt,” it said, adding that the turbine would be able to cope with extreme conditions such as a level-17 typhoons with 56 metre/second wind speeds. There was no indication of production timelines or other details of commercial introduction plans in a brief statement announcing the launch on social media."</em> <a href="https://www.rechargenews.com/wind/chinas-mingyang-looks-beyond-18mw-with-140-metre-blade-offshore-wind-turbine-giant/2-1-1387565">[...]</a>

<p><em>"An international collaboration between quantum scientists resulted in a new way to measure heat dissipation in superconducting quantum circuits – crucial building blocks for quantum technologies such as computers. The discovery represents a step forward for experimental quantum thermodynamics, the field investigating the interaction of the quantum world and heat, and paves the way for improved quantum devices. As heat sets limits for traditional computing, so it does for quantum computers. Detecting and controlling the heat dissipation of quantum computers is central for developing better and more stable machines. Researchers at Aalto, the Universitét Grenoble Alpes and University of Konstanz worked together to test a theory about heat dissipation in a so-called phase slip in a quantum device. The result was a reliable and efficient way to measure dissipation that could be scaled to cover a range of quantum applications."</em> <a href="https://www.aalto.fi/en/news/by-detecting-tiny-flashes-of-heat-scientists-pave-way-for-more-stable-quantum-computers">[...]</a>

As members of the team went about their work, a snapping sound warned of the dangerously powerful path the laser blazed down the hall. Sometimes the beam’s journey ended at a white ceramic block, filling the air with louder pops and a metallic tang."</em> <a href="https://ece.umd.edu/news/story/nearly-50meter-laser-experiment-sets-record-in-campus-hallway">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Thirteen, 53 and 433. That’s the size of quantum computers in terms of quantum bits, or qubits, which has significantly grown in the last years due to important public and private investments and initiatives. Obviously, it is not only a mere question of quantity: the quality of the prepared qubits is as important as their number for a quantum computer to beat our existing classical computers, that is, to attain what’s called the “quantum advantage”. Yet it is conceivable that soon quantum-computing devices delivering such an advantage will be available. How would this affect our daily lives? Making predictions is never easy, but it is agreed that cryptography will be altered by the advent of quantum computers."</em> <a href="https://theconversation.com/quantum-computers-threaten-our-whole-cybersecurity-infrastructure-heres-how-scientists-can-bulletproof-it-196065">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Random circuit sampling, a popular technique for showing the power of quantum computers, doesn’t scale up if errors go unchecked. In what specific cases do quantum computers surpass their classical counterparts? That’s a hard question to answer, in part because today’s quantum computers are finicky things, plagued with errors that can pile up and spoil their calculations. By one measure, of course, they’ve already done it. In 2019, physicists at Google announced that they used a 53-qubit machine to achieve quantum supremacy, a symbolic milestone marking the point at which a quantum computer does something beyond the reach of any practical classical algorithm. Similar demonstrations by physicists at the University of Science and Technology of China soon followed."</em> <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-algorithm-closes-quantum-supremacy-window-20230109/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Control up to 4 motors with high precision using quadrature encoders, can be added to robots or create CNC machines. Background and Theory The purpose of this project is to create a system that give precise control of speed, acceleration and motion to motors. Although stepper motors can provide high torque and are highly synchronized to the inputs (therefore the microcontroller controlling it can keep track of their current position), they are not efficient while running, it will severely affect the time a battery can last. Also, if for some reason the stepper motor stalls, there is no way for the controller to know that it didn't move but it will register as if it had, this will throw the whole system into chaos (imagine a 3D printer skipping a step because it got jam, the whole printing will be messed up from the event of occurrence). For this reason, I have implemented a system that can control DC motors with feedback to keep track of what has the motor done regardless of the amount of PWM cycles, stalls, etc. This requires the motors to have quadrature encoders (for this analog/power board the motors must be 12V-24V), the LM629 precision motor controller, and a microcontroller to setup the LM629 ICs."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/ederfernandotorres3/precision-motor-controller-with-lm629-and-pic-mcu-a708f2">[...]</a>

However, algae (or algal) bloom commonly refers to the rapid growth of microscopic unicellular algae. Although unicellular algae are mostly innocuous and naturally found in bodies of water like oceans, lakes, and rivers, some algae types can produce hazardous toxins stimulated by environmental factors such as light, temperature, and increasing nutrient levels[2]. Since algal toxins can harm marine life and the ecosystem detrimentally, algal bloom threatens people and endangered species, especially considering wide-ranging water pollution. A harmful algal bloom (HAB) occurs when toxin-secreting algae grow exponentially due to ample nutrients from fertilizers, industrial effluent, or sewage waste brought by runoff in the body of water. Most of the time, the excessive algae growth becomes discernible in several weeks and can be green, blue-green, red, or brown, depending on the type of algae."</em> <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/189129-iot-ai-assisted-deep-algae-bloom-detector">[...]</a>

I hope you get creative with this and make a new application."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/dmalawey/spraymaster-6212d0">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Simple FM Radio with a beautiful retro look linear scale. This time I will present you how to make a simple FM Radio with a beautiful retro look linear scale. The idea for the project was taken from the Volos Projects channel, where is presented the code that was specially made for the LilyGO T-Embed device, which has a TFT screen with a resolution of 320 x 170 pixels. I just adapted the code for the ILI9341 TFT Display which has a resolution of 320×240 pixels powered by an ESP32 dev kit module. The radio interface is the same, and in the remaining part of the screen I added a small clock that shows the time. Actually, as a beginner in programming, I did a little practice drawing figures and placing text on the Display."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/mircemk/linear-scale-5767-fm-radio-on-ili9341-tft-display-e45fb4">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This is a tutorial for how to make a DIY chicken egg incubator from scratch (pun intended) with Arduino! Fully automated incubator! Story I have some chickens, but I want some more! Buying chicks at the store would be way too easy, so I decided to build myself an incubator! What is an Incubator An incubator is a device that hatches eggs. It keeps a space at a certain temperature and humidity for a certain amount of days, till the eggs hatch."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/k-gray/chicken-egg-incubator-with-arduino-44f70f">[...]</a>
