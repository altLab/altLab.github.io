<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1522, o matemático italiano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lodovico_Ferrari">Lodovico Ferrari</a>. Ele foi o primeiro a encontrar uma solução algébrica para a equação biquadrática, ou quartic (uma equação algébrica que contém o quarto poder da quantidade desconhecida mas sem poder superior).</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1984, o físico holandês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Kramers">Hans Kramers</a>. Ele trabalhou com Niels Bohr para compreender como as ondas electromagnéticas interagem com a matéria e fez importantes contribuições para a mecânica quântica e a física estatística. Em 1925, com Werner Heisenberg, desenvolveu a fórmula de dispersão de Kramers-Heisenberg. É também creditado[3] por ter introduzido em 1948 o conceito de renormalização na teoria quântica de campo, embora a sua abordagem fosse não-relativista. É também creditado pelas relações Kramers-Kronig com Ralph Kronig, que são equações matemáticas que relacionam partes reais e imaginárias de funções complexas limitadas pela causalidade. Uma outra refere-se a uma rotação de Kramers quando a taxa de passagem da barreira termicamente activada em função do amortecimento passa por um máximo, passando assim por uma transição entre os regimes de difusão de energia e de difusão espacial. É também conhecido pelo teorema de Kramers.</p>

<p>Em 1935, o detective Leonard Keeler realizou a primeira utilização da sua invenção, o polígrafo Keeler, ou máquina detector de mentiras, neste dia, em Portage, WI. Os examinados foram dois criminosos Cecil Loniello e Tony Grignano, que foram condenados por agressão no seu julgamento, onde os resultados foram introduzidos como prova.</p>

<p><em>"Ten sample tubes, capturing an amazing variety of Martian geology, have been deposited on Mars’ surface so they could be studied on Earth in the future. Less than six weeks after it began, construction of the first sample depot on another world is complete. Confirmation that NASA’s Perseverance Mars rover successfully dropped the 10th and final tube planned for the depot was received around 5 p.m. PST (8 p.m. EST) Sunday, Jan. 29, by mission controllers at the agency’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. This major milestone involved precision planning and navigation to ensure the tubes could be safely recovered in the future by the NASA-ESA (European Space Agency) Mars Sample Return campaign, which aims to bring Mars samples to Earth for closer study. Throughout its science campaigns, the rover has been taking a pair of samples from rocks the mission team deems scientifically significant. One sample from each pair taken so far now sits in the carefully arranged depot in the “Three Forks” region of Jezero Crater."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-perseverance-rover-completes-mars-sample-depot">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Toshiba Electronic Devices &amp; Storage Corporation ("Toshiba") has launched automotive 40V N-channel power MOSFETs, “XPQR3004PB” and “XPQ1R004PB,” that use the new L-TOGL™ (Large Transistor Outline Gull-wing Leads) package and feature a high drain current rating with low On-resistance. Shipments start today. In recent years, the transition to EVs has fueled demand for components adapted to the increased power consumption of automotive equipment. The new products use Toshiba’s new L-TOGL™ package, which supports large currents, low resistance, and high heat dissipation. The products do not have an internal post[1] structure, achieved by unifying the source connective part and outer leads with a copper clip. A multi-pin structure for the source leads decreases package resistance to about 30% that of the existing TO-220SM(W) package, pushing the drain current (DC) rating of XPQR3004PB to 400A—1.6 times higher than that of the current product[2]."</em> <a href="https://toshiba.semicon-storage.com/ap-en/company/news/news-topics/2023/01/automotive-20230131-1.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://news.microsoft.com/apac/features/microsoft-university-researchers-use-ai-to-aid-in-study-of-ancient-script-on-chinas-oracle-bones/">Microsoft, university researchers use AI to aid in study of ancient script on China’s “oracle bones”</a></h2>

<p><em>"Since farmers began digging up ancient bone fragments in the fields around the Yellow River in eastern China over 100 years ago, researchers have been poring over the mysterious script found on them. The script on the “oracle bones,” so called because they were used to try to divine the future, is the earliest known form of Chinese writing, dating back 3,000 years. But their study has been challenging: the bones are fragile and fragmented, copies of the script made by ink rubbings can be blurry or incomplete and collections are scattered in national museums and private collections in China and around the world. Now researchers in Beijing are using AI to fast-track the basic but necessary work of comparing each script sample with thousands of others in databases. This work paves the way for researchers to decipher them and shed light on everything from the daily concerns of people in ancient times to how Chinese writing first developed. “This is a great example of human-machine collaboration,” said Bofeng Mo, a professor from the Center for Oracle Bone Studies at Capital Normal University, who worked on the project with Zhirong Wu, a senior researcher at Microsoft Research Asia."</em> <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/apac/features/microsoft-university-researchers-use-ai-to-aid-in-study-of-ancient-script-on-chinas-oracle-bones/">[...]</a>

The mission was the fifth launch by SpaceX so far this year, and the 69th launch with a primary purpose of placing Starlink internet satellites into orbit. With the 56 fresh spacecraft launched Thursday, SpaceX has deployed 3,773 Starlink satellites, with plans to add thousands more in the coming years. Liftoff of the 229-foot-tall (70-meter) Falcon 9 rocket from pad 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station occurred at 4:32:20 a.m. EST (0932:20 GMT) Thursday. Light rain showers moved through the spaceport in the hour before liftoff, but conditions cleared sufficiently to permit the Falcon 9 to get off the ground on time. The 56 Starlink internet satellites mounted on top of the Falcon 9 rocket headed into an orbital plane that is part of SpaceX’s second-generation Starlink net network, called Gen2."</em> <a href="https://spaceflightnow.com/2023/01/26/falcon-9-starlink-5-2-coverage/">[...]</a>

Ultra-fast charging (XFC) and low-temperature performance are extremely important for the design of high-performance lithium-ion batteries. Designing new electrolytes, improving the Li+transport in the cathode/electrolyte interface reaction layer (CEI), and improving the structural stability of the secondary particles of the oxide polycrystalline cathode material are effective ways to solve the ultra-fast charging and rapid capacity decay of lithium-ion batteries at low temperatures. Based on this, the research team of Yang Wen, the associate professor of the School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering of BIT, published a research paper entitled "Colloid Electrolyte with Changed Li+Solvation Structure for High-Power, Low-Temperature Lithium-Ion Batteries" in the internationally renowned journal Advanced Materials. Yang Wen's research team added lithium thiocarbonate (LTC) as an additive to the commercial electrolyte (LE) to form a colloidal electrolyte (CLE) with the Tyndall phenomenon. In colloidal electrolyte, LTC can have strong interaction with PF6 anion and organic solvent; On the one hand, LTC weakens the electrostatic attraction between the anion and cation of LiPF6 electrolyte and realizes high ionic conductivity of the electrolyte at room temperature and low temperature (σLi+ 15 to 4.5 mS cm-1 at 30 and -20 ºC); On the other hand, the strong interaction between LTC and solvent leads to the desolvation process of lithium ion before it is embedded into the cathode material, so as to improve the lithium-ion transport at the cathode interface."</em> <a href="https://english.bit.edu.cn/news2020/focus/9a18a278b49b4d4f9ce8cd5969bde44a.htm">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A new type of analogue computer developed by researchers at UCD and Stanford University could solve some of the most exciting unanswered questions in quantum physics. In new research published in Nature Physics, the collaborating scientists detailed how this ‘quantum simulator’ can simulate interactions between two quantum objects, and can easily be scaled for more complicated systems - offering the opportunity to delve into the tantalising topics of superconductors and other unusual states of matter. “Certain problems are simply too complex for even the fastest digital classical computers to solve,” said Dr Andrew Mitchell, Director of the UCD Centre for Quantum Engineering, Science, and Technology (C-QuEST) and co-author of the paper. “The accurate simulation of complex quantum materials such as the high-temperature superconductors is a really important example – that kind of computation is far beyond current capabilities because of the exponential computing time and memory requirements needed to simulate the properties of realistic models. “While we have not yet been able to build an all-purpose programmable quantum computer with sufficient power to solve all of the open problems in physics, what we can now do [with quantum simulators] is build bespoke analogue devices with quantum components that can solve specific quantum physics problems.” The essential idea behind these specialised analogue devices is to build a hardware solution to the problem rather than writing code for a digital computer. The new ‘quantum simulator’ architecture involves electronic circuits with nanoscale components whose properties are governed by the laws of quantum mechanics."</em> <a href="https://www.ucd.ie/newsandopinion/news/2023/february/01/analoguesolutionoffersanswerstosomeofquantumphysicsbiggestquestions/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"EPFL researchers have combined low-power chip design, machine learning algorithms, and soft implantable electrodes to produce a neural interface that can identify and suppress symptoms of various neurological disorders. Mahsa Shoaran of the Integrated Neurotechnologies Laboratory in the School of Engineering collaborated with Stéphanie Lacour in the Laboratory for Soft Bioelectronic Interfaces to develop NeuralTree: a closed-loop neuromodulation system-on-chip that can detect and alleviate disease symptoms. Thanks to a 256-channel high-resolution sensing array and an energy-efficient machine learning processor, the system can extract and classify a broad set of biomarkers from real patient data and animal models of disease in-vivo, leading to a high degree of accuracy in symptom prediction. “NeuralTree benefits from the accuracy of a neural network and the hardware efficiency of a decision tree algorithm,” Shoaran says. “It’s the first time we’ve been able to integrate such a complex, yet energy-efficient neural interface for binary classification tasks, such as seizure or tremor detection, as well as multi-class tasks such as finger movement classification for neuroprosthetic applications.” Their results were presented at the 2022 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference and published in the IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, the flagship journal of the integrated circuits community.

Their new version is constructed much like traditional wool or cotton yarns. Twistrons sewn into textiles can sense and harvest human motion; when deployed in salt water, twistrons can harvest energy from the movement of ocean waves; and twistrons can even charge supercapacitors. First described by UTD researchers in a study published in 2017 in the journal Science, twistrons are constructed from carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which are hollow cylinders of carbon 10,000 times smaller in diameter than a human hair. To make twistrons, the nanotubes are twist-spun into high-strength, lightweight fibers, or yarns, into which electrolytes can also be incorporated."</em> <a href="https://news.utdallas.edu/science-technology/carbon-nanotube-yarn-2023/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"An international team of scientists have demonstrated a leap in preserving the quantum coherence of quantum dot spin qubits as part of the global push for practical quantum networks and quantum computers. These technologies will be transformative to a broad range of industries and research efforts: from the security of information transfer, through the search for materials and chemicals with novel properties, to measurements of fundamental physical phenomena requiring precise time synchronisation among the sensors. Spin-photon interfaces are elementary building blocks for quantum networks that allow converting stationary quantum information (such as the quantum state of an ion or a solid-state spin qubit) into light, namely photons, that can be distributed over large distances. A major challenge is to find an interface that is both good at storing quantum information and efficient at converting it into light. Optically active semiconductor quantum dots are the most efficient spin-photon interface known to date but extending their storage time beyond a few microseconds has puzzled physicists in spite of decade-long research efforts. Now, researchers at the University of Cambridge, the University of Linz and the University of Sheffield have shown that there is a simple material's solution to this problem that improves the storage of quantum information beyond hundred microseconds."</em> <a href="https://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/news/researchers-find-ways-improve-storage-time-quantum-information-spin-rich-material">[...]</a>

The materials are very cheap, can be processed into thin films with minimal energy input and achieve already efficiencies that are significantly higher than those of conventional silicon solar cells. The Goal: 20 Years Outdoor Stability However, solar modules are expected to provide stable output for at least 20 years in outdoor conditions while exposed to large temperature fluctuations. Silicon PV manages this easily, whereas the semi-organic perovskites lose performance rather fast. "Sunlight can heat up the inside of a PV cell to 80 Celsius; in the dark, the cell then cools down immediately to the outside temperature. This triggers large mechanical stresses in the thin layer of perovskite microcrystals, creating defects and even local phase transitions, so that the thin film loses its quality," explains Prof. Antonio Abate, who heads a large group at HZB."</em> <a href="https://www.helmholtz-berlin.de/pubbin/news_seite?nid=24528&amp;sprache=en&amp;seitenid=1">[...]</a>

New approaches to separate the valuable ore from unwanted materials are needed. The research team combined theory and experiment to gain atom-level insights on monazite, providing a first look at surface features important to the design of flotation collector molecules – materials that work like life jackets to buoy up monazite particles on air bubbles from mixed mineral slurries. “Our efforts address materials needed for froth flotation techniques used to separate high-grade ore from low-value materials during processing.

<p><em>"Some of the most exciting topics in modern physics, such as high-temperature superconductors and some proposals for quantum computers, come down to the exotic things that happen when these systems hover between two quantum states. Unfortunately, understanding what's happening at those points, known as quantum critical points, has proved challenging. The math is frequently too hard to solve, and today's computers are not always up to the task of simulating what happens, especially in systems with any appreciable number of atoms involved. Now, researchers at Stanford University and the Department of Energy's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and their colleagues have taken a step toward building an alternative approach, known as a quantum simulator. Although the new device, for now, only simulates the interactions between two quantum objects, the researchers argue in a paper published January 30 in Nature Physics that it could be scaled up relatively easily. If so, researchers could use it to simulate more complicated systems and begin answering some of the most tantalizing questions in physics."</em> <a href="https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/news/2023-01-30-researchers-take-step-toward-novel-quantum-simulators">[...]</a>

The ability to use perovskites to generate power in space is enticing because they offer a lower-cost and lightweight option to other technologies with the potential for achieving efficiencies similar to those of current space PV technologies.

<p><em>"Hello and welcome to this guide! Today let's see how we can turn an ordinary front door bell into a smart doorbell, so a doorbell that's connected to our smart home ans so to our smartphone. This idea came from a problem: in my house the doorbell chime is in the electrical panel with the main switch. The electrical panel has its own door, and it is itself inside a cabinet. So if someone rings the doorbell it can be heard very little, and my idea was to get a notification on the phone when someone rings. This system is very useful for me also because I often build my projects in my garage, so with the notification on my phone I know if someone rings the doorbell while I'm in the garage."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Make-Your-Doorbell-Smart-With-an-ESP8266/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A simple method for incorporating vacuum fluorescent display tubes into your projects! I've had a handful of Soviet-made IV-6 (ИВ-6) tubes sitting around my workshop for years, but I never really tried to get them working for any of my projects. But when I recently started restoring a Soviet-made variable transformer, I realized they would would make a good solution for displaying the voltage output level. So I built this driver circuit to get them going, with the idea that it could be applied to a wide range of future projects. I happen to live Tbilisi, Georgia (formerly a part of the USSR), so these tubes are relatively easy to come by, but they are also sold widely on eBay.

<p><em>"The aim of this project is to design and implement an air quality monitoring system. This project activates actuators to be able to maintain better air quality around us. This project can be used in our houses, warehouses, and greenhouses. It has a line following the robot on which there is the sensor that measures temperature, humidity, light intensity, and the presence of gas around. Whenever the parameters go beyond the set threshold, it activates an output to try to cancel out the change which is caused. Moreover, the data read is stored in a NodeMCU ESP8266, an IOT module, which is then transferred to the Blynk cloud app."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/Embedded-DIY-Tech/smart-air-quality-monitoring-system-f65fa2">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This project uses modern data acquisition hardware to track the shaft angle of a synchro transmitter as the shaft is turned through various angles. How difficult could it be to get the absolute angle of a position sensor from the 1980’s that was originally developed during the WWII era into a modern computer? Turns out, it’s more difficult than it seems, and for most hobbyist applications, more difficult than it’s worth. Read on to find out more. The synchro, like a potentiometer or encoder, is a device for converting a mechanical rotational position into an electrical signal representing that position or a change in that position. Potentiometers are inexpensive and easy to interface to micros with ADCs."</em> <a href="https://bikerglen.com/blog/building-a-synchro-to-digital-converter/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Over the years I've seen a few posts on Reddit demonstrating the use of a load cell with an internet-connected microcontroller as a weight-based filament sensor for 3D printing. I decided to embark upon a similar project, retrofitting a $10 kitchen scale. It can be really fun to take an inexpensive product and, with a little bit of DIY magic, enhance its functionality. It's a sense of satisfaction a bit different from that of building something end to end from scratch, but every bit as good. I hopped on Amazon and found an Amazon Basics kitchen scale which at time of purchase was about $10 shipped. The entire scale was actually cheaper than some listings for the same type of discreet 20kg-rated load cell found inside, plus we get a factory made case, scale platform, buttons, etc."</em> <a href="https://liore.com/arduino-esp32-load-cell-kitchen-scale-home-assistant/">[...]</a>
