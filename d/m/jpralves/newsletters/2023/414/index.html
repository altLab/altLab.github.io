<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1801, o mineralogista galês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hallowes_Miller">William Hallowes Miller</a>. Ele é conhecido pelos seus índices Millerian construídos sobre o seu sistema de eixos de referência para cristais pelo qual os diferentes sistemas de formas de cristais podem ser designados usando um conjunto de três números inteiros para cada face de cristal. Quando publicou este esquema em A Treatise on Crystallography (1839), ele forneceu uma alternativa à confusão existente devido aos muitos sistemas descritivos diferentes anteriormente em uso. No início da sua carreira, publicou livros de texto de sucesso para hidrostática e hidrodinâmica (1831) e cálculo diferencial (1833). Miller também preparou novas normas em 1843 para substituir as Normas Nacionais de peso e comprimento que se tinham perdido no incêndio de 1834 que destruiu os edifícios do Parlamento.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1890, o astrónomo francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9-Louis_Danjon">André-Louis Danjon</a>. Ele concebeu uma escala agora padrão de cinco pontos para classificar a escuridão e a cor de um eclipse lunar total, que é conhecida como a Escala de Luminosidade de Danjon. Estudou a rotação da Terra, e desenvolveu instrumentos astronómicos, incluindo um fotómetro para medir o brilho da Terra - o brilho de uma lua escura devido à luz reflectida da Terra. Consistia num telescópio em que um prisma dividia a imagem da Lua em duas imagens idênticas lado a lado. Ajustando um diafragma para escurecer uma das imagens até que a porção iluminada pelo sol tivesse o mesmo brilho aparente que a porção iluminada pela terra na imagem não ajustada, ele podia quantificar o ajuste do diafragma, e assim ter uma medida real do brilho da luz da Terra.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1890, o aviador e pioneiro da aviação holandês-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Fokker">Anthony Fokker</a>. Ele tendo visto um avião voar aos 16 anos de idade, foi inspirado a construir o seu primeiro avião aos 20 anos de idade. Este era um monoplano escorado, o Spider que ele colocou montado num hangar Zeppelin vazio em Baden-Baden, e que o pilotava ganhando a sua licença de piloto. A sua primeira fábrica construiu muitos dos aviões de perseguição da Primeira Guerra Mundial da Alemanha, e ganhou reconhecimento, mas no final da guerra foi posto fora de serviço pelo tratado de Versalhes. A 21 de Julho de 1919, criou uma empresa para aviões civis, na Holanda e subsequentemente começou a fabricar nos EUA. Continuou a influenciar as técnicas de construção de aviões, e adoptou a construção de tubos de aço soldado para fuselagem.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1892, o pioneiro da aviação americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Wills_Douglas_Sr.">Donald Douglas</a>. Formou-se no Massachusetts Institute of Technology como o seu primeiro estudante de aeronáutica (1914), depois consultou e desenhou para outros até fundar a sua própria empresa (1920). Ao longo dos anos, a sua empresa estabeleceu o padrão da indústria em termos de fiabilidade e segurança. A série DC de aviões comerciais de passageiros, começando pelo DC-1 (que entrou em serviço em 1933) levou ao DC-8, o primeiro avião comercial a jacto em 1958. Para além dos aviões militares, a empresa produziu também mísseis militares e naves espaciais. O negócio fundiu-se com a McDonnell Aircraft Company em 1967, e após a sua morte, com a Boeing em 1997.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1903, o engenheiro americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Edgerton">Harold E. Edgerton</a>. Ele utilizou uma luz estroboscópica nos seus estudos, que, em 1931, aplicou o estroboscópio à fotografia de ultra-alta velocidade. Formou uma empresa (1947) para se especializar em tecnologia electrónica, o que levou a inventar a máquina fotográfica Rapatronic, capaz de fotografar explosões de testes de bombas nucleares dos EUA a uma distância de 7 milhas. Ao longo da sua carreira, aplicou a fotografia de alta velocidade como ferramenta em várias aplicações científicas. Também desenvolveu o sonar para estudar o fundo do oceano. Usando sonar side-scan, em 1973, ajudou a localizar o navio de guerra civil afundado USS Monitor, perdido desde 1862, ao largo de Cape Hatteras, NC.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1913, o inventor, engenheiro, e biofísico americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Schmitt">Otto Schmitt</a>. Ele ficou conhecido pelas suas contribuições científicas para a biofísica e pelo estabelecimento do campo da engenharia biomédica. Schmitt também cunhou o termo biomimética e inventou ou co-inventou o Schmitt-Trigger, o amplificador diferencial, e o amplificador estabilizado por talhador.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1920, o inventor e engenheiro aeroespacial americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Cover">Jack Cover</a>. Ele inventou a arma de atordoamento Taser a partir de uma inspiração após a leitura de um homem brevemente imobilizado por uma cerca eléctrica. Ele trabalhou na sua garagem e no final dos anos 60 tinha criado um dispositivo semelhante a uma lanterna que usava pólvora para disparar dardos capazes de provocar um choque eléctrico a um alvo num raio de 15 pés. Deu-lhe o nome com a sigla Taser das iniciais das palavras em Thomas A. Swift Electric Rifle adaptadas de um livro de ficção científica favorito da sua infância, Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle. Fundou a empresa Taser Systems Inc. em 1970. Foi classificada como arma de fogo devido ao seu uso de pólvora, mas um desenho revisto, oferecido à Cover em 1993 por Rick e Tom Smith, que utilizavam gás comprimido para projectar o dardo removendo essa restrição. O Departamento de Polícia de Los Angeles foi um dos primeiros a adoptar em 1980.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1928, o bioquímico e geneticista americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Watson">James Watson</a>. Ele partilhou o Prémio Nobel da Fisiologia ou Medicina de 1962 (com Francis Crick e Maurice Wilkins) pela descoberta "da estrutura molecular dos ácidos nucleicos e o seu significado para a transferência de informação em material vivo". O ácido desoxirribonucleico (ADN) é a substância contida nas células que controla a hereditariedade. Crick e Watson iniciaram a sua colaboração em 1951, e publicaram o seu artigo sobre a estrutura da dupla hélice em 2 de Abril de 1953 na Nature. Esta realização tornou-se uma pedra angular da genética e foi amplamente considerada como uma das descobertas mais importantes da biologia do século XX.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1949, o físico germano-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horst_Ludwig_St%C3%B6rmer">Horst Störmer</a>. Ele partilhou (com Daniel C. Tsui e Robert B. Laughlin) o Prémio Nobel da Física de 1998 pela descoberta "de uma nova forma de fluido quântico com excitações de carga fraccionada". Ao experimentar utilizar campos magnéticos extremamente poderosos e baixas temperaturas, em 1982, Störmer e Tsui descobriram que os electrões actuando em conjunto em campos magnéticos fortes podem formar novos tipos de "partículas", com cargas que são fracções de cargas de electrões. No espaço de um ano, Laughlin fez uma análise teórica, explicando o seu resultado".</p>

<p>Em 1938, o investigador da Du Pont Roy J. Plunkett e o seu técnico Jack Rebok descobriram acidentalmente o composto químico politetrafluoroetileno (PTFE), mais tarde comercializado como Teflon. Plunkett estava a investigar as reacções químicas do perfluoroetileno gasoso, a fim de sintetizar novos tipos de gases refrigerantes. A Rebok encontrou um cilindro aparentemente defeituoso deste gás, uma vez que não foi encontrada qualquer pressão quando a válvula foi aberta, apesar de o peso do cilindro ser o mesmo que o dos cilindros cheios. Rebok sugeriu serrar o mesmo para o abrir para investigar. No interior estava um pó branco escorregadio. Plunkett descobriu que tinha propriedades invulgares, um maravilhoso lubrificante sólido em forma de pó, era quimicamente inerte e tinha um ponto de fusão muito elevado. Percebeu que era formado por uma polimerização inesperada. Foi patenteado em 4 de Fevereiro de 1941.</p>

<p><em>"On April 13 2023, the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) mission is scheduled to launch from the European Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana. The ESA-led mission is packed with eleven science instruments for exploring the Jovian ice-covered moons, four of which have been partially developed here in Japan, and Japanese researchers are part of the science teams on a further two instruments. Jupiter has three icy moons, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, whose surfaces appear to consist of a solid ice shell with a suspected deep liquid water ocean beneath. The presence of water makes the moons intriguing prospects for a possible habitable environment, albeit one extremely different from Earth. JUICE will examine the three moons themselves and the environment surrounding Jupiter to understand conditions that exist both in the moons’ surface and within their watery interior. A particular focus for JUICE is the middle of the three icy satellites, Ganymede."</em> <a href="https://cosmos.isas.jaxa.jp/global-space-news-juice-is-preparing-to-launch/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"These objects are more than 100 times brighter than they should be. Observations by the agency’s NuSTAR X-ray telescope support a possible solution to this puzzle. Exotic cosmic objects known as ultra-luminous X-ray sources produce about 10 million times more energy than the Sun. They’re so radiant, in fact, that they appear to surpass a physical boundary called the Eddington limit, which puts a cap on how bright an object can be based on its mass. Ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs, for short) regularly exceed this limit by 100 to 500 times, leaving scientists puzzled. In a recent study published in The Astrophysical Journal, researchers report a first-of-its-kind measurement of a ULX taken with NASA’s Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR)."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasa-study-helps-explain-limit-breaking-ultra-luminous-x-ray-sources">[...]</a>

When atomic nuclei such as gold or lead nuclei collide at high energy in particle colliders, they can produce quark–gluon plasma (QGP) – a hot and dense state of matter predicted to have existed shortly after the Big Bang. One of the key features of QGP formation in such heavy-ion collisions is a long-range spatial correspondence, or correlation, between the particles that are created in the collisions. This collective phenomenon, which manifests as a ridge-like shape in data plots and is known as the ridge, was first observed in 2005 in heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory in the US, and has since been observed at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in smaller collision systems such as collisions between protons.

<p><em>"Thanks to a breakthrough in the field of magnonics, EPFL researchers have sent and stored data using charge-free magnetic waves, rather than traditional electron flows. The discovery could solve the dilemma of energy-hungry computing technology in the age of big data. Like electronics or photonics, magnonics is an engineering subfield that aims to advance information technologies when it comes to speed, device architecture, and energy consumption. A magnon corresponds to the specific amount of energy required to change the magnetization of a material via a collective excitation called a spin wave (visualized above). Because they interact with magnetic fields, magnons can be used to encode and transport data without electron flows, which involve energy loss through heating (known as Joule heating) of the conductor used. As Dirk Grundler, head of the Lab of Nanoscale Magnetic Materials and Magnonics (LMGN) in the School of Engineering explains, energy losses are an increasingly serious barrier to electronics as data speeds and storage demands soar."</em> <a href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/magnon-based-computation-could-signal-computing-pa/">[...]</a>

This understanding could allow engineers and chemists to develop more efficient catalysts and tune industrial processes — potentially with enormous energy savings, given that 90% of the products we encounter in our lives are produced, at least partially, via catalysis. Catalyst materials accelerate chemical reactions without undergoing changes themselves. They are critical for refining petroleum products and for manufacturing pharmaceuticals, plastics, food additives, fertilizers, green fuels, industrial chemicals and much more. Scientists and engineers have spent decades fine-tuning catalytic reactions — yet because it’s currently impossible to directly observe those reactions at the extreme temperatures and pressures often involved in industrial-scale catalysis, they haven’t known exactly what is taking place on the nano and atomic scales. This new research helps unravel that mystery with potentially major ramifications for industry."</em> <a href="https://news.wisc.edu/new-atomic-scale-understanding-of-catalysis-could-unlock-massive-energy-savings/">[...]</a>

The NXP MR-Buggy3 Kit, together with the new NXP NavQPlus and the BOSCH BME688 where part of awarded hardware (discounts) from NXP, as part of the NXP HoverGames3, to accomplish this project. Soil Monitoring: Importance, what and how Agriculture all over the world is facing a difficult and critical challenge with degradation of soil fertility and with that lower crop yields, even with higher fertilization."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/NotBlackMagic/autonomous-soil-quality-assessment-autosqa-2eb2de">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Hello and welcome back to my channel! For the past few months I have been building a motorized system to move the camera when I shoot video footage for the videos that I publish on my channel. The idea behind this project is to shoot footage with a very smooth and stable movement easily and without having to redo it many times, like I used to do when I did camera movements by hand. I had actually already built something similar back in June, that was made of a rotating base on which to put my tripod. The idea worked but the construction had many problems, so I decided to take another approach. Anyway, the whole project started with the idea of moving the camera placed on the tripod using a remote control with a joystick."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Arduino-Camera-Robot-Motorized-Pan-Tilt-Head/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.instructables.com/PCB-Hotplate-Slightly-Bigger-Edition/">PCB Hotplate Slightly Bigger Edition</a></h2>

<p><em>"So here's the "PCB Hotplate slightly bigger edition" which is Version 2 of my previously made PCB Hotplate project. The most significant change in this project was the size of the hotplate, which is approximately 99mm x 98mm in total and the heating area, which is approximately 65mm x 98mm. (The previous hotplate was tiny, measuring only 60mm x 90mm in total, with a heating area of only 60mm x 55mm.) The new model is powered by an XIAO M0 DEV Board and features an OLED display that shows the current temperature of the heating coil. XIAO was chosen due to its small size and the ATSAMD21G18 microcontroller, which is an ARM Cortex-M0+ processor. Seeed Studio created it, and it is part of the Seeeduino XIAO family."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/PCB-Hotplate-Slightly-Bigger-Edition/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.instructables.com/Dash-Camera-Power-Supply-With-Ultra-Low-power-Off-/">Dash Camera Power Supply With Ultra Low "power Off" Consumption (50uA)</a></h2>

<p><em>"This power source is intended for Dash cameras permanent power supply. Compared to commercial models, it has 50 to 100 times lower consumption in the off state. I bought a commercial MiVue SmartBox lll, but it is not as smart as it is called. In the "power off mode" when the camera is turned off due to low voltage, it still draws about 3.5 mA from the car battery! In other words, every 12 days it consumes 1 Ah from your car battery. If you add this 3.5 mA to the "normal consumption" of a switched-off "modern car" (which is 2 to 30mA) then, after long-term parking in cold conditions (or if your battery is old) it can cause the car will not start."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Dash-Camera-Power-Supply-With-Ultra-Low-power-Off-/">[...]</a>
