<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1791, o artista e inventor americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Morse">Samuel Morse</a>. Ele ficou famoso pelo desenvolvimento do Código Morse (1838) e pelo aperfeiçoamento independente de um telégrafo eléctrico (1832-35). Passou a primeira parte da sua vida como retratista e só se dedicou à ciência em 1832, quando já tinha passado o seu 40º aniversário. Estava a regressar à América depois de uma viagem pela Europa, quando conheceu Charles T. Jackson no barco, que o inspirou sobre os recém-descobertos electroímanes. A partir daí, Morse trabalhou para desenvolver aparelhos para comunicações eléctricas. Com o apoio do Congresso, construiu uma linha de 40 milhas entre Baltimore, Maryland e Washington D.C., que teve o seu primeiro ensaio em 23 de Maio de 1843. Ficou pronta para utilização pública em 1 de Abril de 1845.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1846, o inventor belgo-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Joseph_Van_Depoele">Charles Joseph Van Depoele</a>. Ele foi pioneiro nos caminhos-de-ferro, na iluminação eléctrica e no trabalho mineiro, com mais de 100 patentes de invenções eléctricas. Emigrou para os Estados Unidos em 1869. Enquanto fazia experiências com motores eléctricos em Detroit (1874), estabeleceu a praticabilidade dos vagões ferroviários movidos a electricidade. Inventou um gerador eléctrico (1880) e exibiu um eléctrico em funcionamento na Exposição de Aparelhos Ferroviários de Chicago (1883). Concebeu sistemas de eléctricos para várias cidades. Em 1888, vendeu as suas patentes de caminhos-de-ferro eléctricos à Thomson-Houston Electric Company de Lynn, Massachusetts. As suas outras patentes incluem: lâmpada de arco (1870), máquina de extracção de carvão (1891), locomotiva eléctrica sem engrenagens (1894).</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1896, o químico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_Carothers">Wallace Carothers</a>. Ele desenvolveu o nylon (1935), a primeira fibra de polímero sintético a ser fiada a partir de uma fusão. Produziu esta poliamida por condensação do ácido adípico e da hexametilenodiamina. Trabalhou para a empresa química duPont como chefe de investigação em química orgânica a partir de 1928. Através do seu estudo de moléculas de cadeia longa, actualmente designadas por polímeros, desenvolveu também a primeira borracha sintética bem sucedida, o neopreno (1931). A DuPont produziu o nylon comercialmente a partir de 1938 e lançou as bases da indústria de fibras sintéticas. O nylon revelou-se excelente nas suas propriedades como análogo sintético da seda.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1942, o cosmonauta e médico russo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valeri_Polyakov">Valeri Polyakov</a>. Ele estabeleceu o recorde da mais longa estadia contínua no espaço, 438 dias (8 de Janeiro de 1994 - 22 de Março de 1995) a bordo da estação espacial russa Mir. Com uma estadia anterior de 241 dias na Mir (29 de Agosto de 1988 - 27 de Abril de 1989), também detinha o recorde de resistência espacial acumulada de 679 dias. Deixou o serviço espacial em 1 de Junho de 1995. A sua formação incluiu medicina astronáutica. Em 22 de Março de 1972, foi seleccionado como cosmonauta especialista em biomedicina para uma missão planeada à estação espacial e começou a treinar em Outubro de 1972. O recorde cumulativo de permanência no espaço foi posteriormente batido por Sergei Avdeyev em 13 de Agosto de 1999 (3 missões, total de 748 dias) e depois em 16 de Agosto de 2005 por Sergei Krikalev (6 missões, total de 803 dias).</p>

<p>Em 1880, a primeira patente americana para um aparelho auditivo eléctrico foi concedida a Francis D. Clarke e M.G. Foster, intitulada "Device for Aiding the Deaf to Hear" (Dispositivo para ajudar os surdos a ouvir) (n.º 226.902). O dispositivo utilizava a condução óssea, através da qual o som é transmitido pela vibração do osso do crânio. Só em 1901 é que foi produzido o primeiro aparelho auditivo disponível no mercado, o Acousticon, inventado por Miller Reese Hutchinson.</p>

<p>Em 1970, a síntese do elemento 105, através da fusão de núcleos de califórnio e azoto, foi comunicada na reunião da American Physical Society em Washington, D.C., por Albert Ghiorso do Lawrence Radiation Laboratory da Universidade da Califórnia em Berkeley. O elemento artificial tinha uma massa atómica de 260, meia-vida de cerca de 1,6 segundos e uma prova melhor do que uma tentativa russa de 1968, que a equipa americana considerava não provada. Foi proposto o nome hahnium, em homenagem ao falecido Otto Hahn. Eventualmente, a União Internacional para a Química Pura e Aplicada decidiu que se chamaria dúbio e reconheceu a anterior reivindicação de descoberta em 1968 por uma equipa liderada por Georgy Flerov no Instituto Conjunto Russo de Investigação Nuclear que bombardeou amerício com néon."</p>

<p>E nesta semana que passou foi lançada uma nova versão do kernel Linux com uma série de melhorias de hardware, desempenho e segurança. Como seria de esperar, o kernel 6.3 do Linux apresenta uma quantidade enorme código para  suporte de CPUs e hardware gráfico da Intel e da AMD que ainda não foram lançados. Por muito excitantes (e necessários) que sejam, é um pouco difícil sentirmo-nos entusiasmados quando, poucas pessoas irão beneficiar imediatamente. Felizmente, há muitas alterações que têm um impacto mais directo na nossa utilização quotidiana. Uma mudança notável relacionada à AMD no Linux 6.2 é o suporte ao IBRS automático da AMD para mitigação de Spectre. Isto oferece um menor impacto no desempenho do que a execução especulativa retpoline que é frequentemente utilizada actualmente. No que diz respeito à arquitectura, novos drivers de gestão de energia para ARM e RISC-V são lançados no Linux 6.3. O último também recebe suporte para funções de string aceleradas (por meio da extensão de manipulação de bits Zbb) e o primeiro ganha suporte para instruções de extensão de matriz escalável 2. Nos sistemas de ficheiros, o sistema de ficheiros NFS (tanto do lado do cliente como do lado do servidor) suporta agora encriptação baseada em AES-SHA2; optimizações para o desempenho de E/S directa do EXT4; descompressão de baixa latência para o EROFS, e um controlador de sistema de ficheiros Brtfs mais rápido. O suporte de hardware traz uma interface de controlador Steam Deck nativa em HID, permite que o volante de corrida Logitech G923 Xbox edition funcione no Linux; melhora o comportamento dos controladores com fio 8BitDo Pro 2; e adiciona monitorização de sensores para uma série de motherboard Ryzen da ASUS. Além disso, mais de 150.000 linhas de código para suportar placas ARM (antigas e não utilizadas) foram removidas nesta actualização.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker e alguns vídeos interessantes. São apresentadas as revistas HackSpace Magazine Nº 66 e a MagPI nº 129 de Maio.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2023/04/linux-kernel-6-3-features">Linux Kernel 6.3 Released, This is What’s New</a></h2>

<p><em>"A new version of the Linux kernel is out with an assortment of hardware, performance, and security improvements. Announcing the release of Linux 6.3 over on the Linux kernel mailing list (LKML) Linus Torvalds remarked “…here we are, right on schedule, with the 6.3 release out and ready for your enjoyment”. So what’s new? Let’s take a breezy whip (and I do mean breezy) through the new n’ notable. Linux 6.3: New Features As you’d expect Linux kernel 6.3 features a ton of enablement and support for upcoming and yet-to-be-released CPUs and graphics hardware from Intel and AMD. As exciting (and necessary) as these are they’re a bit hard to feel hype for when, y’know, few people will benefit right away."</em> <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2023/04/linux-kernel-6-3-features">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A pair of quakes in 2021 sent seismic waves deep into the Red Planet’s core, giving scientists the best data yet on its size and composition. While NASA retired its InSight Mars lander in December, the trove of data from its seismometer will be pored over for decades to come. By looking at seismic waves the instrument detected from a pair of temblors in 2021, scientists have been able to deduce that Mars’ liquid iron core is smaller and denser than previously thought. The findings, which mark the first direct observations ever made of another planet’s core, were detailed in a paper published April 24 in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences. Occurring on Aug. 25 and Sept. 18, 2021, the two temblors were the first identified by the InSight team to have originated on the opposite side of the planet from the lander – so-called farside quakes. The distance proved crucial: The farther a quake happens from InSight, the deeper into the planet its seismic waves can travel before being detected."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasa-insight-study-provides-clearest-look-ever-at-martian-core">[...]</a>

<p><em>"China's fully robotic rover on Mars, in longer-than-expected hibernation since May 2022, likely met with excessive accumulation of sand and dust, its mission designer said, breaking months of silence about the status of the vehicle. The motorised rover Zhurong, named after a mythical Chinese god of fire, was expected to have woken up in December after entering a planned sleep mode in May 2022 as falling solar radiation with the advent of winter cut its power generation. "We have not had any communication from the rover since it entered hibernation," said Zhang Rongqiao, chief designer of China's Mars exploration programme. "We are monitoring it every day and believe it has not woken up because the sunlight has not yet reached the minimum level for power generation." An unforeseen pile-up of dust most likely affected power generation and Zhurong's ability to wake up, Chinese state television reported on Tuesday, quoting Zhang. A camera on board a NASA probe orbiting Mars showed the Chinese rover had not moved since at least September, according to official images."</em> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/space/china-breaks-silence-over-status-stationary-martian-rover-2023-04-25/">[...]</a>

Given that light flow within a medium is governed by the refractive index, specific tailoring of the refractive index is needed to realize control of the light path within the medium. To this end, scientists have developed what are called “aperiodic photonic volume elements” (APVEs), microscopic voxels with specific refractive indices located at predefined positions to direct the flow of light in a controlled manner. However, sculpting these elements requires a high degree of precision, and most light-shaping materials are limited to 2D configurations or end up degrading the output light beam profile.

<p><em>"Scientists have unlocked one of the biggest mysteries of quasars – the brightest, most powerful objects in the Universe – by discovering that they are ignited by galaxies colliding. - First discovered 60 years ago, quasars can shine as brightly as a trillion stars packed into a volume the size of our Solar System, but until now it has remained a mystery what could trigger such powerful activity - By observing 48 galaxies that host quasars and comparing them to over 100 non-quasar galaxies, scientists discovered that the phenomenon is ignited by galaxies colliding - When two galaxies collide, gravitational forces push huge amounts of gas towards supermassive black holes at the centre of the remnant galaxy system that results from the collision – just before the gas is consumed by the black hole, it releases extraordinary amounts of energy in the form of radiation, resulting in a quasar - The Milky Way is likely to experience its own quasar when it collides with the Andromeda galaxy in roughly five billion years’ time Scientists have unlocked one of the biggest mysteries of quasars – the brightest, most powerful objects in the Universe – by discovering that they are ignited by galaxies colliding. First discovered 60 years ago, quasars can shine as brightly as a trillion stars packed into a volume the size of our Solar System. In the decades since they were first observed, it has remained a mystery what could trigger such powerful activity. New work led by scientists at the Universities of Sheffield and Hertfordshire has now revealed that it is a consequence of galaxies crashing together. The collisions were discovered when researchers, using deep imaging observations from the Isaac Newton Telescope in La Palma, observed the presence of distorted structures in the outer regions of the galaxies that are home to quasars."</em> <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/news/astronomers-solve-60-year-mystery-quasars-most-powerful-objects-universe">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Most of the world is covered in oceans, which are unfortunately highly polluted. One of the strategies to combat the mounds of waste found in these very sensitive ecosystems -- especially around coral reefs -- is to employ robots to master the cleanup. However, existing underwater robots are mostly bulky with rigid bodies, unable to explore and sample in complex and unstructured environments, and are noisy due to electrical motors or hydraulic pumps. For a more suitable design, scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems (MPI-IS) in Stuttgart looked to nature for inspiration.

Mass spectrometers are extremely precise chemical analyzers that have many applications, from evaluating the safety of drinking water to detecting toxins in a patient’s blood. But building an inexpensive, portable mass spectrometer that could be deployed in remote locations remains a challenge, partly due to the difficulty of miniaturizing the vacuum pump it needs to operate at a low cost. MIT researchers utilized additive manufacturing to take a major step toward solving this problem. They 3D printed a miniature version of a type of vacuum pump, known as a peristaltic pump, that is about the size of a human fist. Their pump can create and maintain a vacuum that has an order of magnitude lower pressure than a so-called dry, rough pump, which doesn’t require liquid to create a vacuum and can operate at atmospheric pressure."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/3d-printed-miniature-vacuum-pump-0425">[...]</a>

The research offers an intricate understanding of a complex phenomenon that is foundational to quantum computing—a method that can perform certain calculations significantly more efficiently than conventional computing. “In an era of quantum computing it’s vital to generate a precise characterization of the systems we are building,” explains Dries Sels, an assistant professor in New York University’s Department of Physics and an author of the paper, which appears in the journal Nature Physics. “This work reconstructs the full state of a quantum liquid, consistent with the predictions of a quantum field theory—similar to those that describe the fundamental particles in our universe.” Sels adds that the breakthrough offers promise for technological advancement. “Quantum computing relies on the ability to generate entanglement between different subsystems, and that’s exactly what we can probe with our method,” he notes. “The ability to do such precise characterization could also lead to better quantum sensors—another application area of quantum technologies.” The research team, which included scientists from TU Wien (Vienna), ETH Zurich, Free University of Berlin, and the Max-Planck Institute of Quantum Optics, calculated quantum information measures of a quantum system via a tomography procedure—the reconstruction of a specific quantum state with the aim of seeking experimental evidence of a theory."</em> <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2023/april/scientists-have-full-state-of-a-quantum-liquid-down-cold.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"BIU researchers with colleagues from Abu Dhabi have developed a technology that improves computational performance of quantum computers A project led by a group of researchers from Israel's Bar-Ilan University, in collaboration with TII - the Quantum Research Center in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, is advancing quantum computing by improving the performance of superconducting qubits, the basic computation units of a superconducting quantum processor. The improved qubit, called a Tunable Superconducting Flux Qubit, is a micron-sized superconducting loop where electrical current can flow clockwise or counterclockwise, or in a quantum superposition in both directions. These quantum features would allow the computer to be much faster and more powerful than a normal computer. For the speed potential to be realized, the quantum computer needs to operate several hundred of qubits simultaneously without having them unintentionally interfering with each other. As an alternative technology to that existing today in quantum processors, superconducting flux qubits provide several important advantages: First, they are very fast and reliable; and second, it may be simpler to integrate many flux qubits into a processor compared to current available technology. Comparing a quantum computer to a piano, Dr. Michael Stern, of the Department of Physics and Quantum Entanglement Science and Technology (QUEST) Center at Bar-Ilan University, says, "Imagine wanting to play a certain note on a piano, but actually playing a number of keys together simultaneously and inadvertently, since the distance between the various keys isn't large enough."</em> <a href="https://www.biu.ac.il/en/article/13137">[...]</a>

But to see really, really small things—down to the scale of billionths of a meter, thousands of times less than the width of a human hair—to see those things, you need extreme ultraviolet light (and a good microscope).

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) project on the DHT22 sensor provides a way to measure and monitor temperature and humidity in a variety of environments. This project involves using a DHT22 sensor to measure temperature and humidity, and then storing the data in a database for further analysis. The data can then be used to make decisions about climate control in a building, or to alert users when the environment is not suitable for their needs. Additionally, the data can be used to track trends in weather and climate over time, allowing for more informed decisions about how to best use resources for energy efficiency.

During the design process, and actually, before, many things happened that turned this project into a slightly more complicated task than I have initially accounted for.
