<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1749, o matemático, físico e astrónomo francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Laplace">Pierre-Simon Laplace</a>. Ele ficou conhecido pela sua análise matemática da estabilidade do sistema solar (1773), aliviando as preocupações de Isaac Newton sobre as perturbações entre planetas. Ele fez uma abordagem exacta da ciência. Ele desenvolveu uma explicação da tensão superficial de um líquido em termos de atracções intermoleculares, investigou a acção capilar e a velocidade do som. Ajudou Antoine Lavoisier (1783) a investigar o calor específico e os aquecedores de combustão, iniciando a ciência da termoquímica. Ele acreditava que o sistema solar se formou a partir de uma nebulosa em colapso. Contribuiu para a matemática da probabilidade e cálculo, na qual uma equação diferencial é conhecida pelo seu nome, e esteve envolvido no estabelecimento do sistema métrico.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1881, o químico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Staudinger">Hermann Staudinger</a>. Ele recebeu o Prémio Nobel da Química de 1953 pela sua descoberta da estrutura dos polímeros como moléculas de cadeia longa. Em 1910, desenvolveu uma nova e simples síntese para o isopreno, a unidade molecular básica em borracha sintética. Na década de 1920, Staudinger tinha formado a sua opinião de que as moléculas de polímero podiam ser uma cadeia muito longa de unidades repetidas unidas por ligações químicas normais, em vez da opinião predominante de que os polímeros eram apenas uma agregação desordenada de moléculas mais pequenas mantidas juntas por algumas outras forças. Ele cunhou o termo macromolécula (1922). Eventualmente, a cristalografia de raios X confirmou a sua estrutura de polímeros de cadeia longa. O seu trabalho foi uma grande contribuição para a biologia molecular.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1882, a matemática alemã <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Noether">Emmy Noether</a>. Ela ficou conhecida pelas suas contribuições para a álgebra abstracta, em particular, o seu estudo das condições de cadeia sobre ideais de anéis. Na física teórica, produziu o Teorema de Noether, que prova uma relação entre simetrias na física e princípios de conservação. Este resultado básico na teoria geral da relatividade foi elogiado por Einstein. Foi o seu trabalho na teoria das invariantes que levou à formulação de vários conceitos da teoria geral da relatividade de Einstein. Para o seu obituário no The New York Times, Albert Einstein escreveu: "Fraulein Noether foi o génio matemático mais significativo produzido até agora desde o início do ensino superior das mulheres".</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1905, o físico inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Randall_(physicist)">John Randall</a>. Ele contribuiu com melhorias críticas ao magnetrão da cavidade, o dispositivo gerador de microondas utilizado no radar, foi uma importante descoberta para vencer a Segunda Guerra Mundial. Um magnetrão é agora comum nas casas dentro do forno de microondas. Os magnetrões anteriores fabricados na década de 1920 deram uma baixa potência. Em Fevereiro de 1940, o desenvolvimento por Randall com Harry Boot do pequeno magnetrão de cavidade que gerava comprimentos de onda de centímetros a uma potência muito superior, permitiu que o radar detectasse objectos mais pequenos. Por sua vez, este equipamento mais compacto com uma antena mais pequena permitiu a fácil instalação móvel de radar de alta resolução em aeronaves. Após a guerra, Randall virou-se para a biofísica, incluindo a realização de trabalhos experimentais sobre a estrutura do ADN.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1912, o engenheiro de foguetes germano-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernher_von_Braun">Wernher von Braun</a>. Ele foi um dos mais importantes criadores de foguetes e da sua evolução para aplicações na exploração espacial. O seu interesse começou quando era adolescente na Alemanha, e durante a II Guerra Mundial liderou o desenvolvimento do míssil balístico mortal V-2 para os nazis (cujo papel permanece controverso). Após a guerra, foi levado a usar os seus conhecimentos para produzir foguetes para o exército dos EUA. Em 1960, transferiu-se para a recém-formada NASA e tornou-se director do Marshall Space Flight Center e arquitecto chefe do veículo de lançamento Saturn V utilizado para colocar homens na lua. As suas contribuições incluem os satélites Explorer; Júpiter, Pershing, Redstone e Saturn foguetes, e Skylab.</p>

<p>Em 1875, a primeira sondagem da Fossa das Marianas foi feita pelo navio de pesquisa britânico, H.M.S. Challenger, durante a sua primeira expedição oceanográfica global, descobrindo parte da região mais profunda conhecida dos oceanos da Terra. As medições precisas da superfície continuam a ser difíceis, mas em 2010, a NOAA utilizou impulsos sonoros para gravar uma profundidade de 36.070 pés (10.994 m) na fossa Challenger Deep no seu extremo sul. A Fossa das Marianas situa-se no Oceano Pacífico ocidental, a leste das Ilhas Marianas, perto de Guam. A sua grande profundidade resulta na colisão de duas enormes placas de crosta oceânica, uma zona de subducção, onde a borda de uma mergulha por baixo da outra no manto da Terra. A 23 de Janeiro de 1960, Piccard e Walsh atingiram o fundo na baia de Trieste.</p>

<p>Em 2001, a estação espacial russa, Mir, terminou 15 anos em órbita ao arder na atmosfera terrestre como o caminho escolhido para terminar a sua vida. Mir, lançada em 1986, tinha ultrapassado largamente a sua duração original de cinco anos prevista. O governo russo decidiu em Outubro de 2000 que o seu mau estado já não podia justificar as despesas para manter a sua utilização. Um navio-tanque Progress atracado tinha sido comandado remotamente por controladores de missão para disparar foguetes e baixar a sua órbita e provocar a sua reentrada na atmosfera. Os destroços que não arderam durante a reentrada caíram inofensivamente no Oceano Pacífico, na zona alvo planeada entre a Nova Zelândia e o Chile. Por razões de segurança, as companhias aéreas tinham reencaminhado os voos do Pacífico em antecipação do evento, e os navios tinham sido avisados mais cedo.</p>

<p><em>"In just a few hours of observations, the space telescope revealed a dynamic atmosphere on a planet 40 light-years from Earth. Researchers observing with NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope have pinpointed silicate cloud features in a distant planet’s atmosphere. The atmosphere is constantly rising, mixing, and moving during its 22-hour day, bringing hotter material up and pushing colder material down. The resulting brightness changes are so dramatic that it is the most variable planetary-mass object known to date. The team, led by Brittany Miles of the University of Arizona, also made extraordinarily clear detections of water, methane, and carbon monoxide with Webb’s data, and found evidence of carbon dioxide. This is the largest number of molecules ever identified all at once on a planet outside our solar system."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-webb-spots-swirling-gritty-clouds-on-remote-planet">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Additional 40% lower RDS(on) and increase power density by 58x for telecom &amp; computing hot-swap computing applications Nexperia, the expert in essential semiconductors, today announced the release of its first 80 V and 100 V application-specific MOSFETs (ASFETs) for hotswap with enhanced safe operating area (SOA) in a compact 8x8 mm LFPAK88 package. These new ASFETs are fully optimized for demanding hotswap and soft-start applications and are qualified to 175°C for use in advanced telecom and computing equipment. By applying decades of expertise in both advanced silicon and package development, Nexperia’s PSMN2R3-100SSE (100 V, 2.3 mΩ N-channel ASFET) is the leading addition in the portfolio, delivering low RDS(on) and strong linear-mode (safe operating area) performance in a compact 8x8 mm footprint, tailored to meet the requirements of demanding hotswap applications. Nexperia has also released PSMN1R9-100SSE (80 V, 1.9 mΩ), an 80 V ASFET which responds to the growing trend for using 48 V power rails in computing servers and other industrial applications where environmental conditions allow for MOSFETs with a lower BVDS rating. ASFETs with enhanced SOA are becoming increasingly popular within hotswap and soft start applications. Their strong linear mode performance is essential to manage in-rush current effectively and reliably when capacitive loads are introduced to the live backplane."</em> <a href="https://www.nexperia.com/about/news-events/press-releases/Nexperia-introduces-the-first-application-specific-MOSFETs--ASFETs--for-hotswap-in-SMD-copper-clip-LFPAK88-packaging-for-60--reduced-footprint.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.isas.jaxa.jp/en/topics/003324.html">Unique quantum inference effect captured by cosmic X-ray polarimeter - New physics experiments opened up by a state-of-the-art space observation instrument</a></h2>

<p><em>"An unanticipated polarization of high-energy X-rays emitted when highly charged ions capture high-energy electrons has been discovered experimentally for the first time. The measurement used a high-energy X-ray polarization detector that has been previously developed for high sensitivity space observations with the electron beam ion trap Tokyo-EBIT experiment at the University of Electro-Communications. Estimates from atomic physics had previously suggested that the electron state transition would emit unpolarized radiation, but the measured X-rays turned out to be highly polarized. Polarization measurements of high-energy X-rays are considered valuable in atomic physics research, but their use has been hindered in the past due to the lack of detectors capable of accurate measurements. These experiments were performed by Associate Professor Watanabe Shin (JAXA Institute of Space and Astronautical Science, ISAS) who joined the experimental group led by Professor Nakamura Nobuyuki (Institute for Laser Science, University of Electro-Communications) and Professor Takahashi Tadayuki (Kavli IPMU, University of Tokyo). These results were achieved by combining two state-of-the-art instruments and technologies: the EBIT-CC high-energy Compton X-ray polarimeter developed for space observations and adapted for this research principally at the JAXA Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), and the Tokyo-EBIT world-leading multiply-charge ion generator and experimental instrument at the University of Electro-Communications."</em> <a href="https://www.isas.jaxa.jp/en/topics/003324.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.onsemi.com/company/news-media/press-announcements/en/onsemi-develops-igbt-fs7-switch-platform-with-leading-performance-for-industrial-markets">onsemi Develops IGBT FS7 Switch Platform with Leading Performance for Industrial Markets</a></h2>

<p><em>"New 1200 V devices offer the best conduction and switching performance on the market onsemi, a leader in intelligent power and sensing technologies, today announced a new range of ultra-efficient 1200 V insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) that minimize conduction and switching losses at a performance level that is industry-leading in the market. Intended to enhance efficiency in fast switching applications, the new devices will be primarily used in energy infrastructure applications like solar inverters, uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), energy storage and EV charging power conversion. The new 1200 V Trench Field Stop VII (FS7) IGBTs are used to boost input to high voltage (Boost stage) as well as the inverter to provide an AC output in high switching frequency energy infrastructure applications. The low switching losses of FS7 devices enable higher switching frequencies that reduce the size of magnetic components, increasing power density and reducing system cost. For high-power energy infrastructure applications, the positive temperature coefficient of FS7 devices enables easy parallel operation. “As efficiency is extremely critical in all high switching frequency energy infrastructure applications, we focused on reducing turn-off switching losses and providing the best switching performance in this new range of IGBTs,” said Asif Jakwani, senior vice president and general manager of the Advanced Power Division, which is part of the Power Solutions Group at onsemi."</em> <a href="https://www.onsemi.com/company/news-media/press-announcements/en/onsemi-develops-igbt-fs7-switch-platform-with-leading-performance-for-industrial-markets">[...]</a>

Its Terran 1 rocket took off from Cape Canaveral in Florida, successfully clearing the pad and launch structure, and achieving ‘Max Q’ – or the point during the launch sequence at which the vehicle is under the most pressure in terms of atmospheric resistance and stress – and also succeeded at cutting off its main engines and separating its first stage as intended. The launch did not reach orbit, which is an extremely rare thing to happen on a new space launch platform’s first ever flight anyway. Relativity said during the launch that they encountered an anomaly with the second stage engines after main engine cut-off and stage separation, which meant Terran 1 didn’t continue on its intended path to low-Earth orbit. This test launch did not include a payload or fairing, but instead carried a demonstration weight in the form of an early 3D-printed part from the company’s rocket development process. Relativity Space’s first launch should definitely be counted as a success, as the company proved that its 3D-printed rocket body can withstand the extreme forces at play during that crucial ‘Max Q’ period."</em> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/23/relativity-space-launches-first-3d-printed-rocket/">[...]</a>

The organic molecules from which OLEDs are made have intrinsically broad emission spectra -- a property that limits the available colour space and saturation for high-end displays. Colour filters or optical resonators can be used to artificially narrow the emission spectra of OLEDs to circumvent this issue."</em> <a href="https://portal.uni-koeln.de/en/universitaet/aktuell/press-releases/single-news/displays-with-more-brilliant-colours-through-a-fundamental-physical-concept">[...]</a>

<p><em>"University of Minnesota Twin Cities researchers, along with a team at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), have developed a breakthrough process for making spintronic devices that has the potential to become the new industry standard for semiconductors chips that make up computers, smartphones, and many other electronics. The new process will allow for faster, more efficient spintronics devices that can be scaled down smaller than ever before. The researchers' paper is published in Advanced Functional Materials, a peer-reviewed, top-tier materials science journal. "We believe we've found a material and a device that will allow the semiconducting industry to move forward with more opportunities in spintronics that weren't there before for memory and computing applications," said Jian-Ping Wang, senior author of the paper and professor and Robert F. Hartmann Chair in the University of Minnesota Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. "Spintronics is incredibly important for building microelectronics with new functionalities." Wang said Minnesota has been leading this effort in a big way for more than 10 years with strong support by the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and the National Science Foundation (NSF)."</em> <a href="https://cse.umn.edu/college/news/researchers-create-breakthrough-spintronics-manufacturing-process-could-revolutionize">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Measuring temperature and nitrogen levels in soil is important for agriculture systems but detecting them apart from one another is difficult to do. Huanyu “Larry” Cheng, James L. Henderson, Jr. Memorial Associate Professor of Engineering Science and Mechanics at Penn State, led researchers in the development of a multi-parameter sensor that can effectively decouple temperature and nitrogen signals so that each can be measured accurately. The results were recently published by Advanced Materials. “For efficient fertilization, there is a need for continuous and real-time monitoring of soil conditions, specifically nitrogen utilization and soil temperature,” Cheng said. “This is essential for evaluating crop health, reducing environmental pollution and promoting sustainable and precision agriculture.” Using nitrogen as a fertilizer is common practice in agriculture, and the goal is to use the ideal amount for the best crop output. When too little is nitrogen is used, the crop’s yield may be less than optimum."</em> <a href="https://www.psu.edu/news/engineering/story/new-soil-sensor-may-improve-efficiency-crop-fertilization/">[...]</a>

Quantum error correction is a process designed to keep quantum information intact for a period of time longer than if the same information were stored in hardware components without any correction. The results were published March 21 in Nature. Information in classical computing comes in the form of bits corresponding to ones or zeros. In quantum computing, information is stored in special devices with quantum properties that are known as quantum bits, or “qubits.” In the lab of Devoret, the Frederick W.

Now, a joint research team from the Mobile Robotic Systems Group in EPFL’s School of Engineering and School of Computer and Communication Sciences and the Hiveopolis project at Austria’s University of Graz have developed a robotic system that can be unobtrusively built into the frame of a standard honeybee hive. Composed of an array of thermal sensors and actuators, the system measures and modulates honeybee behavior through localized temperature variations. “Many rules of bee society – from collective and individual interactions to raising a healthy brood – are regulated by temperature, so we leveraged that for this study,” explains EPFL PhD student Rafael Barmak, first author on a paper on the system recently published in Science Robotics."</em> <a href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/robotic-system-offers-hidden-window-into-collectiv/">[...]</a>
