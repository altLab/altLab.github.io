<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1655, o inventor italiano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartolomeo_Cristofori">Bartolomeo Cristofori</a>. Ele é responsável pela invenção do piano. Ele era fabricante de cravos e em determinada altura resolveu modificar um desses instrumentos e substituir as penas utilizadas no interior do instrumento por pequenos martelos, criando uma bela melodia e que trouxe mais vida às músicas tocadas por ele.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1733, o matemático e astrónomo náutico francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Charles_de_Borda">Jean-Charles de Borda</a>. Ele é conhecido pelos seus estudos de mecânica dos fluidos e pelo desenvolvimento de instrumentos de navegação e de geodesia, o estudo da dimensão e da forma da Terra. Borda entrou para a marinha, participou em várias viagens científicas e desempenhou um papel na Guerra da Independência Americana. Foi um dos principais impulsionadores da introdução do sistema decimal. Borda utilizou o cálculo e a experimentação para unificar os domínios da física. Para os seus trabalhos de topografia, desenvolveu também uma série de tabelas trigonométricas. Em 1782, quando comandava uma flotilha de seis navios franceses, foi capturado pelos britânicos. A saúde de Borda piorou após a sua libertação. É um dos 72 cientistas homenageados com placas na Torre Eiffel.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1806, o inventor inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Fothergill_Cooke">William Fothergill Cooke</a>. Ele trabalhou com Charles Wheatstone no desenvolvimento da telegrafia eléctrica. Da dupla, Cooke contribuiu com uma capacidade comercial superior, enquanto Wheatstone é geralmente considerado o mais importante dos dois na história do telégrafo. Depois de Cooke ter assistido a uma demonstração da utilização do fio na transmissão de mensagens, iniciou as suas próprias experiências com telegrafia (1836) e formou uma parceria com Wheatstone. A sua primeira patente (1837) era impraticável devido ao custo. Demonstraram o seu telégrafo de cinco agulhas em 24 de Julho de 1837, quando fizeram funcionar uma linha telegráfica ao longo da linha férrea de Euston a Camden Town, capaz de transmitir e receber com êxito uma mensagem. Em 1845, patentearam um telégrafo eléctrico de agulha única.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1845, o filósofo e matemático britânico <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Kingdon_Clifford">William Kingdon Clifford</a>. Ele desenvolveu a teoria dos biquaterniões (uma generalização da teoria dos quaterniões do matemático irlandês Sir William Rowan Hamilton) e que depois a associou a álgebras associativas mais gerais. Em 1870, sobreviveu a um naufrágio perto da Sicília quando se encontrava numa expedição a Itália para obter dados científicos de um eclipse. Influenciado pelos trabalhos de Riemann e Lobachevsky, Clifford estudou a geometria não-euclidiana. Em 1870, escreveu a obra On the Space Theory of Matter, na qual defende que a energia e a matéria são simplesmente diferentes tipos de curvatura do espaço. Neste trabalho, apresentou ideias que viriam a desempenhar um papel fundamental na teoria geral da relatividade de Einstein.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1874, o engenheiro electrotécnico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Conrad">Frank Conrad</a>. Ele, devido ao seu interesse pela radiotelefonia, criou a  primeira estação de rádio comercial. Conrad trabalhou para a Westinghouse como engenheiro-chefe assistente na fábrica de East Pittsburgh e adquiriu mais de 200 patentes durante a sua vida. Como amador, tendo construído uma estação de transmissão no segundo andar da garagem atrás da sua casa em Wilkinsburg, Pensilvânia, quando substituiu o microfone por um fonógrafo, descobriu uma grande audiência de ouvintes que tinham construído os seus próprios aparelhos de rádio de cristal e que, ao ouvirem a música, escreviam ou telefonavam a pedir mais música e notícias. Quando ficou sobrecarregado com esses pedidos, decidiu transmitir programas regulares e programados para satisfazer os seus ouvintes. Foi ele quem cunhou o termo "transmissão".</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1899, o industrial alemão do sector automóvel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_von_Opel">Fritz von Opel</a>. Ele participou, com Max Valier e Friedrich Wilhelm Sander, em experiências de propulsão por foguetões para automóveis e aviões. Em 11 de Abril de 1928, em Berlim, testaram o primeiro foguetão automóvel tripulado. Em 30 de Setembro de 1929, von Opel pilotou o Opel Sander Rak.1, um planador equipado com 16 foguetões de 50 libras de impulso cada, e fez um voo bem sucedido de 75 segundos, cobrindo quase 2 milhas perto de Frankfurt-am-Main, Alemanha, com Von Opel como piloto. Ao patrocinar estes primeiros testes de transporte com foguetões, a Opel popularizou a ideia da propulsão por foguetões na Alemanha.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1926, o físico canadiano-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._Allan_Bromley">D. Allan Bromley</a>. Ele é considerado o "pai da moderna ciência dos iões pesados" pelas suas experiências pioneiras sobre a estrutura e a dinâmica dos núcleos atómicos. Foi um dos líderes no desenvolvimento de sistemas de detecção de aceleradores de partículas e de sistemas de aquisição e análise de dados por computador. Enquanto esteve na Atomic Energy of Canada (1955-60), instalou o primeiro acelerador tandem Van Der Graaff. Foi fundador e director (1963-89) do Laboratório de Estrutura Nuclear A.W. Wright na Universidade de Yale, que produziu mais físicos nucleares experimentais do que qualquer outra instalação. Durante este período, tornou-se activo em numerosos conselhos de política científica nacionais e internacionais. De 1980 a 1989, foi membro do Conselho Científico da Casa Branca.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1931, o engenheiro electrotécnico e inventor coreano-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawon_Kahng">Dawon Kahng</a>. Ele é conhecido pelo seu trabalho em electrónica de estado sólido. É mais conhecido por ter inventado o MOSFET (transístor de efeito de campo metal-óxido-semicondutor, ou transístor MOS), juntamente com o seu colega Mohamed Atalla, em 1959. Kahng e Atalla desenvolveram os processos PMOS e NMOS para o fabrico de dispositivos semicondutores MOSFET. O MOSFET é o tipo de transístor mais utilizado e o elemento básico da maioria dos equipamentos electrónicos modernos. Mais tarde, Kahng e Atalla propuseram o conceito de circuito integrado MOS e realizaram trabalhos pioneiros sobre díodos Schottky e transístores de base nanométrica no início da década de 1960. Kahng inventou então o MOSFET de porta flutuante (FGMOS) com Simon Min Sze em 1967. Kahng e Sze propuseram que os FGMOS pudessem ser utilizados como células de memória de porta flutuante para memória não volátil (NVM) e memória só de leitura reprogramável (ROM), que se tornaram a base das tecnologias EPROM (erasable programmable ROM), EEPROM (electrically erasable programmable ROM) e memória flash. Kahng foi introduzido no National Inventors Hall of Fame em 2009.</p>

<p>Em 1989, a sonda espacial Magellan foi transportada no compartimento de carga da missão STS-30 do vaivém espacial Atlantis, lançado do Centro Espacial Kennedy, na Florida. A sonda espacial foi baptizada com o nome do explorador português do século XVI, Fernão de Magalhães. Esta foi a primeira nave espacial planetária a ser lançada de um vaivém em órbita terrestre. Chegou à sua planeada órbita polar em torno de Vénus em 10 de Agosto de 1990, que circulou uma vez em cada 3 horas e 15 minutos. Enquanto o planeta girava lentamente por baixo, a Magellan recolheu imagens de radar da superfície em faixas com cerca de 17-28 km (10-17 mi) de largura e transmitiu a informação por rádio. A sua missão incluía a realização de outras medições. Em 11 de Outubro de 1994, foi direccionada para a superfície, recolhendo dados até se incendiar na atmosfera.</p>

<p><em>"The work is based on new modeling and explores how oceans could exist in unlikely places in our solar system. Re-analysis of data from NASA’s Voyager spacecraft, along with new computer modeling, has led NASA scientists to conclude that four of Uranus’ largest moons likely contain an ocean layer between their cores and icy crusts. Their study is the first to detail the evolution of the interior makeup and structure of all five large moons: Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, Oberon, and Miranda. The work suggests four of the moons hold oceans that could be dozens of miles deep. In all, at least 27 moons circle Uranus, with the four largest ranging from Ariel, at 720 miles (1,160 kilometers) across, to Titania, which is 980 miles (1,580 kilometers) across. Scientists have long thought that Titania, given its size, would be most likely to retain internal heat, caused by radioactive decay."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/new-study-of-uranus-large-moons-shows-4-may-hold-water">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4545.html">New toolchain and software package from STMicroelectronics ease development of edge processing with intelligent inertial sensors</a></h2>

<p><em>"STMicroelectronics has released a toolchain and accompanying software package for programming the intelligent sensor processing unit (ISPU) embedded in the latest-generation intelligent MEMS IMUs, ISM330IS and LSM6DSO16IS. The toolchain and software help employ the ISPU to handle motion-related workloads such as activity recognition and anomaly detection directly in the sensor. This permits reducing system power and latency, offloading the local microcontroller, and uniquely specializing the behavior of the sensor to the application. Using the ISPU toolchain, developers can program the sensor’s intelligent processing unit using the familiar and widespread C programming language. They can choose to work from a command line interface (CLI) or an Eclipse-based environment like STM32CubeIDE, and to use a graphical user interface (GUI) such as AlgoBuilder and Unicleo. The X-CUBE-ISPU software package contains templates and example projects as well as ready-to-use libraries that help developers quickly understand how to use and program the sensors’ ISPU and can be used as a starting point to implement custom algorithms."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4545.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Exactly 30 years ago, on 30 April 1993, CERN made an important announcement. Walter Hoogland and Helmut Weber, respectively the Director of Research and Director of Administration at the time, decided to publicly release the tool that Tim Berners-Lee had first proposed in 1989 to allow scientists and institutes working on CERN data all over the globe to share information accurately and quickly. Little did they know how much it would change the world. On this day in 1993, CERN released the World Wide Web to the public. Now, it is an integral feature of our daily lives: according to the International Telecommunications Union, more than 5 billion people, two thirds of the worldwide population, rely on the internet regularly for research, industry, communications and entertainment. “Most people would agree that the public release was the best thing we could have done, and that it was the source of the success of the World Wide Web,” says Walter Hoogland, co-signatory of the document that proclaimed the Web’s release, “apart from, of course, the World Wide Web itself!” Public domain: then and now The release of the World Wide Web was launched by an internal document, addressed “to whom it may concern” and signed by Hoogland and Weber."</em> <a href="https://home.web.cern.ch/news/news/computing/30-years-free-and-open-web">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.cnrs.fr/en/moons-heart-revealed-first-time">The Moon's heart revealed for the first time</a></h2>

<p><em>"Fifty years after Apollo 11 paved the way for the first surveys of the Moon, a team of scientists from CNRS, Université Côte d'Azur, the Côte d'Azur Observatory, Sorbonne Université and the Paris Observatory-PSL has shed light on part of its internal structure that had until now remained a mystery: the Moon has a solid core, like the Earth.

Photosynthesis plays a crucial role in shaping and sustaining life on Earth, yet many aspects of the process remain a mystery. One such mystery is how Photosystem II, a protein complex in plants, algae and cyanobacteria, harvests energy from sunlight and uses it to split water, producing the oxygen we breathe. Now researchers from the Department of Energy’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, together with collaborators from Uppsala University, Humboldt University, and other institutions have succeeded in cracking a key secret of Photosystem II. Using SLAC’s Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) and the SPring-8 Angstrom Compact free electron LAser (SACLA) in Japan, they captured for the first time in atomic detail what happens in the final moments leading up to the release of breathable oxygen.

This demonstration, reported in the scientific journal Nature, opens the door to a completely new class of electrically pumped lasing devices — highly flexible, solution-processable laser diodes that can be prepared on any crystalline or non-crystalline substrate without the need for sophisticated vacuum-based growth techniques or a highly controlled clean-room environment. “The capabilities to attain light amplification with electrically driven colloidal quantum dots have emerged from decades of our previous research into syntheses of nanocrystals, their photophysical properties and optical and electrical design of quantum dot devices,” said Victor Klimov, Laboratory Fellow and leader of the quantum dot research initiative. “Our novel, ‘compositionally graded’ quantum dots exhibit long optical gain lifetimes, large gain coefficients and low lasing thresholds — properties that make them a perfect lasing material. The developed approaches for achieving electrically driven light amplification with solution-cast nanocrystals might help resolve a long-standing challenge of integrating photonic and electronic circuits on the same silicon chip and is poised to advance many other fields ranging from lighting and displays to quantum information, medical diagnostics and chemical sensing.” More than two decades of research Research over more than two decades has sought to achieve colloidal quantum dot lasing with electrical pumping, a prerequisite for its widespread use in practical technologies.

In “Image Sensing with Multilayer, Nonlinear Optical Neural Networks,” published March 23 in Nature Photonics, researchers in the lab of Peter McMahon, assistant professor of applied and engineering physics in Cornell Engineering, have been able to demonstrate that ONN pre-processors can achieve compression ratios of up to 800-to-1 — the equivalent of compressing a 1,600-pixel input to just 2 pixels — while still enabling high accuracy across several representative computer-vision tasks.

Such electronic processing is power-consuming and, more importantly, requires far more time for the data to be processed and interpreted. “Our setup uses an optical neural network, where the light coming into the sensor is first processed through a series of matrix-vector multiplications that compresses data to the minimum size needed — in this case, four pixels,” Wang said."</em> <a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2023/04/optical-neural-networks-hold-promise-image-processing">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Simple way to make a ESP8266 clock on a VFD display that synchronizes the exact time through NTP time servers on the Internet. A VFD (Vacuum Fluorescent Display) is an electronic display device that is commonly used for displaying numeric or alphanumeric characters. It is similar to an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) but uses a different technology to display information. VFD displays are known for their high brightness, high contrast, and wide viewing angle, making them suitable for use in a variety of applications, including digital clocks. Exactly such a clock is described in this video. Unfortunately, I could not get a datasheet or any more detailed information from the supplier, except that it is compatible with an STM32 microcontroller, which for me meant that it can be easily connected to other microcontrollers such as Arduino."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/mircemk/simple-esp8266-ntp-clock-on-vfd-display-vfd256x50-gp1287-e0187a">[...]</a>

<p><em>"An advanced lithium battery charger and powerbank with a SSD1306 OLED display, charges 18650, 20700 and 21700 batteries. Story I wanted to make a battery charger that was not based on the popular Chinese TP4056 IC that you see all over the internet. So after some research I came across the Texas Instruments BQ25896, this is a single cell 3A charger that can be controlled using I2C, it also has a boost mode and can turn the connected battery into a powerbank delivering up to 2A of current. This charger IC is typically used in mobiles and I did not hand solder it, all the other standard SMD components were hand soldered. The charger IC is controlled using an ATMEGA32U4 microcontroller, the main code was written using the Arduino IDE 2.x and the driver library was coded using Visual Studio. The features and functions of this device are: - Adjustable charge voltage and current with a battery store mode - Adjustable boost voltage and current - SSD1306 OLED display - Rotary encoder for menu selection - Low battery charge mode - Reverse battery polarity protection using MOSFETs - 3 AMP Fast Charge current and 2 AMP powerbank output - USB C, Type A and Micro ports - NTC thermistors for the battery and IC temperature monitoring - ICSP header - Buzzer for audio feedback - Low power mode and full auto power off mode - Heatsink to dissipate the 3 AMP of charging switching loss - WS2812B indicator LEDs"</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/Ratti3/bq25896-atmega32u4-lithium-battery-charger-with-powerbank-684db7">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Did you know that we can create a homebrew PCB exposure box using an old printer scanner? Yes you read it right! The Problem: In my experience, the quality of the presensitized method for making homebrew PCBs is really impressive, especially when you are dealing with tiny traces. Now, the presensitized method needs to be exposed to UV light for a certain amount of time; that means it won't etch well if it gets overexposed or underexposed. Ever since, I've been using my fluorescent lamp to expose the PCBs, but we are going to change that starting today! Here are the things that you will need, you'll need a 12 volt power supply, two 10k potentiometers, an i2c 16x2 LCD, a resistors, a buzzer, an Arduino nano, a TIP 31C transistor, a UV LED strip, a momentary switch, a female DC power jack, a header pin, and lastly, the star of the show, which is the old printer."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Homebrew-PCB-Exposure-Box-Using-an-Old-Printer-Sca/">[...]</a>
