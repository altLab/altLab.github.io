<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1856, o inventor americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Goodrich_Acheson">Edward Goodrich Acheson</a>. Ele descobriu o carborundum abrasivo, a segunda substância mais dura (ao lado de diamantes) e mais tarde aperfeiçoou um método de fabrico de grafite. No início da sua carreira, tinha trabalhado no Menlo Park de Thomas Edison (1880-84), mas partiu para se tornar um inventor independente. Em 1891, estava a experimentar uma fornalha eléctrica, tentando fazer diamantes a partir de uma mistura fundida de coque em pó e argila. Em vez de diamantes, descobriu que tinha feito cristais pequenos, granulosos e duros quase tão duros como os diamantes. Ele determinou que esta substância cristalina era carboneto de silício. Era muito eficaz como abrasivo, que Acheson patenteou (28 de Fevereiro de 1892) e chamou "carborundum". Ele criou a Companhia Carborundum (1894), para fazer mós, pedras de amolar, e abrasivos em pó.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1923, o físico austro-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Kohn">Walter Kohn</a>. Ele partilhou (com John A. Pople) o Prémio Nobel da Química de 1998. O prémio reconheceu o seu trabalho individual sobre cálculos em química quântica. A parte de Kohn no prémio foi para o desenvolvimento da sua teoria da densidade-funcional. Isto aplicou a matemática complexa para fornecer uma técnica de modelação que incorporou a mecânica quântica no estudo das propriedades electrónicas dos materiais. A teoria de Kohn revolucionou de tal forma a ciência dos materiais, que foi referida em cerca de metade de todas as publicações de química quântica que se seguiram. Ele fez grandes contribuições para a física dos semicondutores, supercondutividade, física de superfícies e catálise.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1934, o cosmonauta soviético <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Gagarin">Yuri Gagarin</a>. Ele, a 12 de Abril de 1961, tornou-se o primeiro homem a viajar para o espaço aos 27 anos de idade. Formou-se na escola de cadete da Força Aérea Soviética em 1957. Voluntariou-se para se tornar cosmonauta e juntou-se a um grupo de pilotos de teste para treino. Três dias antes do lançamento, foi informado de que tinha sido seleccionado para pilotar a nave espacial Vostok 1. Orbitou a Terra uma vez em 1 hora e 29 minutos a uma altitude máxima de 301 km. Nunca mais foi para o espaço, mas treinou outros cosmonautas e percorreu várias outras nações. Gagarin foi morto com outro piloto na queda de um avião a jacto de dois lugares enquanto estava no que foi descrito como um voo de treino de rotina.</p>

<p>Em 1948, a Universidade da Califórnia em Berkeley e a Comissão de Energia Atómica anunciaram oficialmente a produção artificial de mésons utilizando o ciclotrão de 184 polegadas no Laboratório de Radiação da universidade. Os mésons na natureza tinham sido anteriormente vistos por Carl Anderson como pistas de câmara de nuvens, e outros (formados por raios cósmicos) tinham sido detectados por outros cientistas em placas fotográficas feitas a grande altitude. Agora, nos limites da energia disponível do ciclotrão, estas partículas de curta duração foram geradas artificialmente por Eugene Gardner e C.M.G. Lattes, utilizando um feixe de partículas alfa aceleradas disparadas sobre um alvo de carbono fino. O tempo relatou a descoberta e deu a entender que o estudo dos mésons poderia "conduzir na direcção de uma fonte de energia atómica muito melhor do que a fissão de urânio".</p>

<p><em>"Sony Semiconductor Solutions Corporation (SSS) today announced the upcoming release of the IMX611, a direct time-of-flight (dToF) SPAD depth sensor for smartphones that delivers the industry’s highest*1 photon detection efficiency. The IMX611 has a photon detection efficiency of 28%, the highest in the industry,*1 thanks to its proprietary single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) pixel structure. *2 This reduces the power consumption of the entire system while enabling high-accuracy measurement of the distance of an object. This new sensor will generate opportunities to create new value in smartphones, including functions and applications that utilize distance information. In general, SPAD pixels are used as a type of detector in a dToF sensor, which acquire distance information by detecting the time of flight of light emitted from a source until it returns to the sensor after being reflected off an object. The IMX611 uses a proprietary SPAD pixel structure that gives the sensor the industry’s highest*1 photon detection efficiency, at 28%, which makes it possible to detect even very weak photons that have been emitted from the light source and reflected off the object."</em> <a href="https://www.sony-semicon.com/en/news/2023/2023030601.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The veteran rover captured a dazzling sunset at the start of a new cloud-imaging campaign. Martian sunsets are uniquely moody, but NASA’s Curiosity rover captured one last month that stands out. As the Sun descended over the horizon on Feb. 2, rays of light illuminated a bank of clouds. These “sun rays” are also known as crepuscular rays, from the Latin word for “twilight.” It was the first time sun rays have been so clearly viewed on Mars. Curiosity captured the scene during the rover’s newest twilight cloud survey, which builds on its 2021 observations of noctilucent, or night-shining, clouds. While most Martian clouds hover no more than 37 miles (60 kilometers) above the ground and are composed of water ice, the clouds in the latest images appear to be at a higher altitude, where it’s especially cold."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-curiosity-views-first-sun-rays-on-mars">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/about/news-releases/products/single-pair-ethernet-10base-t1s-and-100base-t1-devices-transform">Single Pair Ethernet (SPE) 10BASE-T1S and 100BASE-T1 Devices Transform IIoT at the Edge and in Higher-Speed Applications</a></h2>

<p><em>"Microchip’s SPE offering reduces cost and complexity of IIoT edge devices while supporting higher-speed Ethernet-everywhere architectures and applications SPE technology is setting the stage for all-Ethernet IIoT and industrial Operational Technology (OT) networks that are built with a new class of synchronized low-speed Ethernet edge devices and a simplified cabling infrastructure for latency-sensitive traffic streams. Microchip Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP) today announces new industrial-grade SPE products that will help fulfill SPE’s promise, from 10BASE-T1S MAC-PHYs that more easily connect edge IIoT devices to the cloud, to industrial versions of its 100BASE-T1 Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) Ethernet PHY transceivers and switches that enable higher-speed applications across far-reaching Ethernet networks. “Microchip is helping to fuel the adoption of zonal architectures in industrial applications with our new MAC-PHYs that connect to many of Microchip’s microcontrollers (MCUs) to reduce the design complexity and implementation costs for bringing a host of sensors, actuators and other products into the new 10BASE-T1S network infrastructure,” said Matthias Kaestner, vice president at Microchip. “With these new 10BASE-T1S MAC-PHYs and industrial versions of our 100BASE-T1 TSN products, we are making it easier to connect the physical world to the cloud while enabling a seamless Ethernet architecture throughout the IIoT and other industrial networks.” Microchip’s new LAN8650 and LAN8651 10BASE-T1S MAC-PHY Ethernet Controllers with Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) simplify the implementation of zonal architectures by enabling basic MCUs, rather than higher-level MCUs with a Media Access Controller (MAC), to be used when creating sensors, actuators and other devices for the edge of OT and IT networks. These low-speed devices do not need their own communication system, and Microchip’s MAC-PHYs connect them into a standard Ethernet system all the way to the cloud over simple twisted-pair wiring. For industrial applications that require higher bandwidth, designers can use MCUs with an integrated Ethernet MAC."</em> <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/about/news-releases/products/single-pair-ethernet-10base-t1s-and-100base-t1-devices-transform">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4535.html">STMicroelectronics 100V industrial-grade STripFET F8 devices improve figure of merit by 40%</a></h2>

<p><em>"STMicroelectronics’ STL120N10F8 N-channel 100V power MOSFETs combine extremely low gate-drain charge (QGD) and on-resistance RDS(on), giving 40% better figure of merit (FoM) than comparable devices of the preceding generation. The new MOSFETs leverage ST’s advanced STPOWER STripFET F8 technology, which introduces an oxide-filled trench that permits very low conduction losses combined with low gate charge for efficient switching performance. As a result, the STL120N10F8 has 4.6mΩ maximum RDS(on) (at VGS = 10V) and can operate efficiently at switching frequencies up to 600kHz. The STripFET F8 technology also ensures an output capacitance value that helps to mitigate drain-source voltage spikes and to minimize wasted charge-discharge energy. The MOSFET body-drain-diode characteristic also displays increased softness. These improvements reduce electromagnetic emissions and so ease compliance testing of the final system to demonstrate electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) according to applicable product standards."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4535.html">[...]</a>

This amazing feat was achieved with optical traps, which use a highly focused laser beam to hold and move tiny objects. Although optical traps have been used to move individual atoms before, this is the first time an atom has been released from a trap — or thrown — and then caught by another trap. “The freely flying atoms move from one place to the other without being held by or interacting with the optical trap,” said research team member Jaewook Ahn from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology."</em> <a href="https://www.optica.org/en-us/about/newsroom/news_releases/2023/march/in_the_world_s_smallest_ball_game_scientists_throw/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Using ultrafast spectroscopy, the chemistry professor studies the energy transfer that occurs at femtosecond timescales inside plant leaves. During photosynthesis, chlorophyll in plants absorbs packets of energy called photons from the sun’s rays. This energy is then transferred to a series of other chlorophyll molecules organized by protein scaffolds, funneling the energy into the next stage of photosynthesis. Those early light-harvesting stages of photosynthesis involve repeated excitation of pigments, as photons are passed between them. To capture these highly dynamic processes, MIT Associate Professor Gabriela Schlau-Cohen employs ultrafast spectroscopy, a technique that uses extremely short laser pulses to study events that happen on timescales of femtoseconds to nanoseconds. With this approach, Schlau-Cohen has made discoveries that reveal how photosynthesis is regulated under different light conditions, as well as how plants protect themselves from damage by dissipating excess sunlight."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/gabriela-schlau-cohen-illuminating-photosynthesis-0308">[...]</a>

This process is often referred to as "dynamic disorder." Dynamic disorder Understanding dynamic disorder in materials could lead to more energy-efficient thermoelectric devices, such as solid-state refrigerators and heat pumps, and also to better recovery of useful energy from waste heat, such as car exhausts and power station exhausts, by converting it directly to electricity. A thermoelectric device was able to take heat from radioactive plutonium and convert it to electricity to power the Mars Rover when there was not enough sunlight.

This newly emerging approach to quantum computation uses a novel silicon-based qubit device architecture, fabricated in HRL’s Malibu cleanroom, to trap single electrons in quantum dots. Spins of three such single electrons host energy-degenerate qubit states, which are controlled by nearest-neighbor contact interactions that partially swap spin states with those of their neighbors. Posted online ahead of publication in the journal Nature, the HRL experiment demonstrated universal control of their encoded qubits, which means the qubits can be used successfully for any kind of quantum computational algorithm implementation. The encoded silicon/silicon germanium quantum dot qubits use three electron spins and a control scheme whereby voltages applied to metal gates partially swap the directions of those electron-spins without ever aligning them in any particular direction. The demonstration involved applying thousands of these precisely calibrated voltage pulses in strict relation to one another over the course of a few millionths of a second."</em> <a href="https://www.hrl.com/news/2023/03/05/hrl-laboratories-silicon-encoded-spin-qubits-achieve-universality">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Physicists found that speeding electrons trapped in circular loops in graphene quantum dots are highly sensitive to external magnetic fields. Trapped electrons traveling in circular loops at extreme speeds inside graphene quantum dots are highly sensitive to external magnetic fields and could be used as novel magnetic field sensors with unique capabilities, according to a new study. Electrons in graphene (an atomically thin form of carbon) behave as if they were massless, like photons, which are massless particles of light. Although graphene electrons do not move at the speed of light, they exhibit the same energy-momentum relationship as photons and can be described as “ultra-relativistic.” When these electrons are confined in a quantum dot, they travel at high velocity in circular loops around the edge of the dot. “These current loops create magnetic moments that are very sensitive to external magnetic fields,” explained Jairo Velasco Jr., associate professor of physics at UC Santa Cruz. “The sensitivity of these current loops stems from the fact that graphene electrons are ultra-relativistic and travel at high velocity.” Velasco is a corresponding author of a paper on the new findings, published March 6 in Nature Nanotechnology."</em> <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/03/quantum-sensor.html">[...]</a>

In this article/video, I introduce an adjustable 5A DC-to-DC converter circuit that uses an advanced chip, made by Texas Instruments, which is TPS5450. It’s a high-frequency and efficient buck converter chip that provides tight voltage regulation. I have followed several PCB design rules to ensure low noise, low EMI, and high stability of the output voltage."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/hesam-moshiri/5a-35v-adjustable-switching-power-supply-f04882">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The project describes how to build a 1x3 flip-disc display and how to control it via Arduino. Story The design of the 1x3 flip-disc display is based on the project describing a single module (1 disc). The principle of control is the same with the difference that in order to minimize the number of Arduino control lines, a 595D shift register was used. Flip-disc displays require a specific power supply, in order to flip the disc we need to supply the disc with a current pulse of about 0.5A with a precise length of about 1ms (see flip-disc datasheet) and with correct polarity. The basics of controlling flip-disc displays and the principle of operation are described on the Flipo.io website dedicated to flip-disc displays and here.

<p><em>"This is a bot that follows black line. My goal was to make it as compact as possible and to use Infrared LED's instead of Infrared modules. I have used BO motors, Arduino UNO, L298N driver and IR transmitter and Receiver for the electronic components, for the chassis I used acrylic sheet which I fabricated using Laser cutting machine and for the motor clamps I 3D printed them. Supplies - Arduino UNO - BO Motor - L298N Motor driver - Infrared Transmitter and Receiver LED - Resistors: 220ohms and 4.7Kohms - Male to Male and Male to Female Jumper wire - Ball caster wheel - M3 Bolts, Nuts and female to female hex standoff spacer"</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Line-Following-Bot/">[...]</a>
