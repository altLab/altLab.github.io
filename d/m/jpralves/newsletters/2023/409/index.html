<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1862, o físico e sismólogo russo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Borisovich_Golitsyn">Boris Borisovich Golitsyn</a>. Ele desenvolveu métodos e instrumentos científicos para a observação de terramotos e prospecção mineral. Os seus primeiros estudos foram em física molecular, física matemática e electromagnetismo, A partir de 1899 os seus interesses voltaram-se para a sismologia. Em 1906, inventou o primeiro sismógrafo electromagnético eficaz e continuou a melhorá-lo. Tinha um pêndulo com uma bobina de fio isolado à volta de um núcleo magnético fixado ao solo. A pequena corrente gerada na bobina pelo movimento relativo causado por tremores de terra é amplificada para operar um gravador de caneta. A parte do manto terrestre a uma profundidade de 400-800 km, na qual as ondas sísmicas viajam rapidamente, é denominada a camada de Golitsyn em reconhecimento do seu trabalho.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1887, o serralheiro e inventor americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Soref">Harry E. Soref</a>. Ele patenteou o cadeado de aço laminado, e fundador da Master Lock Company (1921). Como serralheiro, Soref tinha-se apercebido de que os cadeados mais baratos, feitos com lâminas de metal estampado, eram de pouca segurança, pois eram facilmente danificados. Ele patenteou (1924) a sua invenção de um cadeado laminado que, tal como as portas de cofre de banco e os navios de guerra, foi construído em laminados de camada sobre camada de aço para maior resistência. Incapaz de vender a sua invenção a um fabricante de cadeados, ele próprio começou a fabricá-los. O Master Lock abriu a sua primeira pequena fábrica em Milwaukee, Wisc. Em 1928 Master Lock ganhou reconhecimento nacional pelo envio de 147.600 cadeados a agentes federais de proibição em Nova Iorque por terem trancado os speakeasies que invadiram.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1902, o físico americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Condon">Edward U. Condon</a>. Ele é recordado pelo princípio Franck-Condon (1928), desenvolvimento de radar e contribuição para a concepção de equipamento de separação magnética posteriormente aplicado ao processamento de urânio para bombas atómicas. O princípio Franck-Condon (1928) é um tratamento quântico-mecânico da afirmação anterior de James Franck (1925) de que em qualquer sistema molecular a transição de um estado energético para outro ocorre de forma tão próxima a instantânea que os núcleos dos átomos envolvidos são estacionários. Durante o projecto de Manhattan, ajudou J. Robert Oppenheimer a reunir a equipa de cientistas que criou as primeiras bombas atómicas em Los Alamos, N.M. Ele liderou um estudo científico sobre OVNI's, que não encontrou provas credíveis.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1908, o engenheiro electrotécnico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Bruch">Walter Bruch</a>. Ele inventou o sistema de televisão a cores Phase Alternating Line (PAL) adoptado na Europa. Numa viagem à América em 1953, encontrou insuficiências no sistema tal como ali se desenvolveu pela primeira vez (NTSC, National Television Standards Committee). Regressou ao empregador alemão, Telefunken, e pesquisou uma forma de melhorar a estabilidade das cores sem necessidade de controlos de tonalidade e tonalidade. Em 1961, foi registada uma patente preliminar, mas foi superada em 30 de Dezembro de 1962 com uma versão definitiva do sistema PAL. Seguiu-se uma luta para ser reconhecido como o melhor método de codificação. A Grã-Bretanha seleccionou o PAL como superior ao NTSC e introduziu-o a 1 de Julho de 1967. Seguiu-se a Alemanha, a 25 de Agosto de 1967. Eventualmente, também a maior parte do mundo.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1913, o físico soviético <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgy_Flyorov">Georgy Nikolaevich Flerov</a>. Ele reconheceu que o urânio sofre fissão espontânea (sem necessidade de bombardeamento de neutrões). Ele foi um dos primeiros investigadores russos da fissão nuclear. No início de 1942, Flerov notou que os artigos sobre fissão nuclear já não apareciam nas revistas ocidentais. Reconhecendo a implicação de que tal investigação se tinha tornado secreta, Flerov escreveu ao Premier Joseph Stalin, insistindo que "devemos construir a bomba de urânio sem demora", (posteriormente liderado por Igor V. Kurchatov.) Em investigações posteriores, Flerov anunciou a síntese de isótopos do elemento 104 (1965) e 106 (1974). Foram feitas co-descobertas nos E.U.A. Vários nomes foram sugeridos. Eventualmente, os nomes adoptados foram rutherfordium e seaborgium.</p>

<p>Em 1949, o primeiro voo mundial sem escala foi completado num bombardeiro da Superforte B-50 da Força Aérea Americana, a Lucky Lady II, com uma tripulação de 14 pessoas chefiada pelo Capitão James Gallagher. Aterraram de volta na base da Força Aérea de Carswell, Fort Worth, Texas, que tinham deixado em 26 de Fevereiro de 1949, cerca de 94 horas antes. O avião foi reabastecido várias vezes em pleno voo na sua viagem de 37.742 km. A sua velocidade média era de 249-mph. Isto foi na altura do transporte aéreo de Berlim e da Guerra Fria. O voo mostrou que a USAF era capaz de projectar potência aérea em qualquer parte do mundo. Os primeiros jactos - três bombardeiros Stratofortress B-52 da Força Aérea Americana - para voar sem parar à volta do mundo - levaram 45 horas (16-18 Jan 1957), completando 39.147 km a uma velocidade média de 525-mph.</p>

<p>Em 1972, foi lançada a nave espacial norte-americana Pioneer 10. Passou perto de Júpiter e Neptuno antes de abandonar o sistema solar. Encontra-se agora a mais de seis mil milhões de milhas da Terra.</p>

<p><em>"A new JPL- and Caltech-developed detector could transform how quantum computers, located thousands of miles apart, exchange huge quantities of quantum data. Quantum computers hold the promise of operating millions of times faster than conventional computers. But to communicate over long distances, quantum computers will need a dedicated quantum communications network. To help form such a network, a device has been developed by scientists at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Caltech that can count huge numbers of single photons – quantum particles of light – with incredible precision. Like measuring individual droplets of water while being sprayed by a firehose, the Performance-Enhanced Array for Counting Optical Quanta (PEACOQ) detector is able to measure the precise time each photon hits it, within 100 trillionths of a second, at a rate of 1.5 billion photons per second. No other detector has achieved that rate."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-quantum-detector-achieves-world-leading-milestone">[...]</a>

As dozens of missions will be operating on and around the Moon and needing to communicate together and fix their positions independently from Earth, this new era will require its own time. Accordingly, space organisations have started considering how to keep time on the Moon. Having begun with a meeting at ESA’s ESTEC technology centre in the Netherlands last November, the discussion is part of a larger effort to agree a common ‘LunaNet’ architecture covering lunar communication and navigation services. Architecture for joint lunar exploration “LunaNet is a framework of mutually agreed-upon standards, protocols and interface requirements allowing future lunar missions to work together, conceptually similar to what we did on Earth for joint use of GPS and Galileo,” explains Javier Ventura-Traveset, ESA's Moonlight Navigation Manager, coordinating ESA contributions to LunaNet."</em> <a href="https://www.esa.int/Applications/Navigation/Telling_time_on_the_Moon">[...]</a>

<p><em>"One interesting aspect of a computer's instruction set is its addressing modes, how the computer determines the address for a memory access. The Intel 8086 (1978) used the ModR/M byte, a special byte following the opcode, to select the addressing mode.1 The ModR/M byte has persisted into the modern x86 architecture, so it's interesting to look at its roots and original implementation. In this post, I look at the hardware and microcode in the 8086 that implements ModR/M2 and how the 8086 designers fit multiple addressing modes into the 8086's limited microcode ROM. One technique was a hybrid approach that combined generic microcode with hardware logic that filled in the details for a particular instruction. A second technique was modular microcode, with subroutines for various parts of the task. I've been reverse-engineering the 8086 starting with the silicon die."</em> <a href="http://www.righto.com/2023/02/8086-modrm-addressing.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The Intel 8086 processor (1978) has a complicated instruction set with instructions ranging from one to six bytes long. This raises the question of how the processor knows the length of an instruction.1 The answer is that the 8086 uses an interesting combination of lookup ROMs and microcode to determine how many bytes to use for an instruction. In brief, the ROMs perform enough decoding to figure out if it needs one byte or two. After that, the microcode simply consumes instruction bytes as it needs them. Thus, nothing in the chip explicitly "knows" the length of an instruction.
