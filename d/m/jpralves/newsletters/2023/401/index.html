<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1771, o inventor e fabricante norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wilkinson_(machinist)">David Wilkinson</a>. Ele patenteou uma máquina de corte de roscas de parafuso que incorporou o suporte da lâmina (14 Dez 1798). Tinha um suporte pesado apoiado em três rolos. Com o seu pai e irmão, Wilkinson forneceu a indústria do algodão, maquinando, fundindo e forjando peças de ferro para construir equipamento de fabrico têxtil para fábricas como Slater Mill, Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Com este negócio para o manter ocupado, Wilkinson não desenvolveu mais a sua máquina de parafusos. O seu negócio falhou no pânico financeiro de 1829. No entanto, a invenção do slide-rest foi amplamente aplicada por outros, especialmente no fabrico de armas de fogo para o governo dos Estados Unidos. Em 1848, pediu ao Congresso uma recompensa financeira pela sua invenção e recebeu 10.000 dólares.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1838, o matemático e engenheiro francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camille_Jordan">Camille Jordan</a>. Ele preparou uma base para a teoria de grupo e construiu sobre o trabalho anterior de Évariste Galois. Como matemático, os interesses de Jordan eram diversos, cobrindo tópicos ao longo dos aspectos da matemática em estudo na sua época. Os tópicos dos seus trabalhos publicados incluem grupos finitos, álgebra linear e multilinear, teoria dos números, topologia dos poliedros, equações diferenciais, e mecânica.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1855, o inventor e fabricante norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_C._Gillette">King C. Gillette</a>. Ele inventou e fabricou a lâmina de barbear de segurança com lâminas descartáveis. Após esforços persistentes para inventar algo que todos usariam, em 1895 produziu uma versão em bruto de uma lâmina de barbear descartável. levou mais seis anos para refinar a sua invenção. A 15 de Novembro de 1904 foi-lhe concedida a patente norte-americana nº 775.134 pela sua ideia e fundou a Gillette Safety Razor Company em Boston, Mass., para fabricar a sua lâmina de barbear e as suas lâminas. Em 1903, vendeu 168 lâminas, mas no ano seguinte vendeu 90.000 lâminas de barbear e mais de 12 milhões de lâminas. Embora tenha permanecido presidente da empresa até 1931, retirou-se para Los Angeles em 1913, tendo-se tornado um milionário. Utópico, escreveu quatro livros que traduzem a sua experiência empresarial em teorias sociais, culminando com The People's Corporation (1924).</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1909, o matemático e lógico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Cole_Kleene">Stephen Cole Kleene</a>. Ele dedicou-se à pesquisa sobre a teoria dos algoritmos e funções recursivas. Desenvolveu o campo da teoria da recursividade com Church, Gödel, Turing e outros. Contribuiu para o Intuicionismo matemático que tinha sido fundado por Brouwer. O seu trabalho sobre a teoria da recursividade ajudou a fornecer os fundamentos da informática teórica. Ao fornecer métodos para determinar que problemas são solúveis, o trabalho de Kleene levou ao estudo de que funções podem ser computadas.</p>

<p><em>"First-ever observation of quantum interference between dissimilar particles offers new approach for mapping distribution of gluons in atomic nuclei—and potentially more Nuclear physicists have found a new way to use the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)—a particle collider at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Brookhaven National Laboratory—to see the shape and details inside atomic nuclei. The method relies on particles of light that surround gold ions as they speed around the collider and a new type of quantum entanglement that’s never been seen before. Through a series of quantum fluctuations, the particles of light (a.k.a. photons) interact with gluons—gluelike particles that hold quarks together within the protons and neutrons of nuclei. Those interactions produce an intermediate particle that quickly decays into two differently charged “pions” (π). By measuring the velocity and angles at which these π+ and π- particles strike RHIC’s STAR detector, the scientists can backtrack to get crucial information about the photon—and use that to map out the arrangement of gluons within the nucleus with higher precision than ever before."</em> <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=120816">[...]</a>

As semiconductor devices become ever smaller, researchers are exploring two-dimensional (2D) materials for potential applications in transistors and optoelectronics. Controlling the flow of electricity and heat through these materials is key to their functionality, but first we need to understand the details of those behaviors at atomic scales. Now, researchers have discovered that electrons play a surprising role in how energy is transferred between layers of 2D semiconductor materials tungsten diselenide (WSe2) and tungsten disulfide (WS2). Although the layers aren’t tightly bonded to one another, electrons provide a bridge between them that facilitates rapid heat transfer, the researchers found. “Our work shows that we need to go beyond the analogy of Lego blocks to understand stacks of disparate 2D materials, even though the layers aren’t strongly bonded to one another,” said Archana Raja, a scientist at the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), who led the study."</em> <a href="https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2023/01/04/electronic-bridge-semiconductor-energy-sharing/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A new method can produce a hundredfold increase in light emissions from a type of electron-photon coupling, which is key to electron microscopes and other technologies. The way electrons interact with photons of light is a key part of many modern technologies, from lasers to solar panels to LEDs. But the interaction is inherently a weak one because of a major mismatch in scale: A wavelength of visible light is about 1,000 times larger than an electron, so the way the two things affect each other is limited by that disparity. Now, researchers at MIT and elsewhere have come up with an innovative way to make much stronger interactions between photons and electrons possible, in the process producing a hundredfold increase in the emission of light from a phenomenon called Smith-Purcell radiation. The finding has potential implications for both commercial applications and fundamental scientific research, although it will require more years of research to make it practical. The findings are reported today in the journal Nature, in a paper by MIT postdocs Yi Yang (now an assistant professor at the University of Hong Kong) and Charles Roques-Carmes, MIT professors Marin Soljačić and John Joannopoulos, and five others at MIT, Harvard University, and Technion-Israel Institute of Technology."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/electron-triggered-light-emission-0104">[...]</a>

Until now, however, researchers seeking to predict the energy usage of robotic systems were forced to rely on a piecemeal method providing only rough approximations under limited conditions. That’s because while an actuator — the device that converts electrical energy into mechanical force and thus movement — is made up of multiple parts, current approaches look only at the motor itself, rather than considering the controllers that also factor in. “Existing power consumption models of actuators typically omit consideration of the switching power converter circuits required for directional, speed, or torque control, so we established a multi-domain framework for switched electromechanical dynamics,” NYU Tandon Associate Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Joo H. Kim says of the work, which was recently published in Chaos. “The switched electromechanical dynamics of a servomotor is derived from the individual models of the internal DC motor, gear train, and H-bridge circuit. The coupled models comprehensively integrate all possible distinct switching configurations of on-state, off-state, and dead time.” As a result of the never-before-published model, roboticists will be able to accurately predict the power consumption of the actuator as a whole — and to effectively minimize that consumption."</em> <a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/news/more-energy-efficient-robotic-systems">[...]</a>

But new computer simulations show that the effect of the changing distance between Earth and the sun has gone unrecognized. The distance between the Earth and the sun varies during the year because of the planet’s slightly elliptical orbit. At its closest approach, Earth is about 3 million miles closer to the sun than at its farthest point. As a result, sunlight is about 7 percent more intense when Earth is closest to the sun.

A catalyst is a substance that designed to drive a specific chemical reaction to convert chemicals to other, less harmful, valuable industrial products. The efficiency at which a given catalyst aides the reaction is often found to be determined by its surface area. For example, a bulk metallic cobalt foil may aid in chemical reductions, but the same number of cobalt atoms in the form of nanoparticles would be significantly more efficient given the greater surface area available for the reaction to take place."</em> <a href="https://www.ansto.gov.au/news/3d-printing-of-single-atom-catalysts-pioneered-by-research-team-for-industrial-chemical-and">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scientists at EPFL have found a way to improve the operational stability of perovskite solar cells, a crucial step towards their commercialization. Hybrid perovskites are materials made from metal halide frameworks interspersed with organic cations. They have attracted a lot of interest in the field of solar energy because of their light-harvesting capacity combined with a low cost of manufacturing, making perovskite solar cells (PSCs) prime candidates for replacing current silicon-based devices. Perovskites also show great potential in a range of applications that include LED lights, lasers, and photodetectors. One of the obstacles on the way to commercializing perovskite solar cells is their operational stability, which puts them at a disadvantage compared to photovoltaic technologies already on the market. This is especially a problem with mixed-halide perovskites, which are ideal materials for tandem solar cells and emission-tunable LEDs because they combine high compositional flexibility with optoelectronic performance."</em> <a href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/improving-the-operational-stability-of-perovskit-4/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://mechse.illinois.edu/news/52762">Researchers show a new way to induce useful defects using invisible material properties</a></h2>

<p><em>"Much of modern electronic and computing technology is based on one idea: Add chemical impurities, or defects, to semiconductors to change their ability to conduct electricity. These altered materials are then combined in different ways to produce the devices that form the basis for digital computing, transistors, and diodes. Indeed, some quantum information technologies are based on a similar principle: adding defects and specific atoms within materials can produce qubits, the fundamental information storage units of quantum computing. Gaurav Bahl, professor of mechanical science and engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and member of the Illinois Quantum Information Sciences and Technology Center (IQUIST), is exploring how special non-linear properties in engineered materials can achieve similar functionalities without the need to add intentional defects. As his research group reports in their article “Self-Induced Dirac Boundary State and Digitization in a Nonlinear Resonator Chain,” published in Physical Review Letters, a metamaterial can change its functionality on its own depending on the power level of the input. A metamaterial is an artificial system that replicates the behavior of real materials made of natural atoms."</em> <a href="https://mechse.illinois.edu/news/52762">[...]</a>

One of the most promising breakthroughs in 6G telecommunications is the possibility of Visible Light Communication (VLC), which is like a wireless version of fiberoptics, using flashes of light to transmit information. Now, a team of researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst has announced that they have invented a low-cost, innovative way to harvest the waste energy from VLC by using the human body as an antenna. This waste energy can be recycled to power an array of wearable devices, or even, perhaps, larger electronics. “VLC is quite simple and interesting,” says Jie Xiong, professor of information and computer sciences at UMass Amherst and the paper’s senior author. “Instead of using radio signals to send information wirelessly, it uses the light from LEDs that can turn on and off, up to one million times per second.” Part of the appeal of VLC is that the infrastructure is already everywhere—our homes, vehicles, streetlights and offices are all lit by LED bulbs, which could also be transmitting data."</em> <a href="https://www.umass.edu/news/article/next-generation-wireless-technology-may-leverage-human-body-energy">[...]</a>

I've been reverse-engineering the 8086 from die photos and this blog post discusses what I've uncovered about the prefetch circuitry. The 8086 was introduced at an interesting point in microprocessor history, where memory was becoming slower than the CPU. For the first microprocessors, the speed of the CPU and the speed of memory were comparable.1 However, as processors became faster, the speed of memory failed to keep up.

<p><em>"The Wemos D1 Mini is an ESP8266 based prototyping board with WiFi connectivity and countless applications. It becomes even more useful in battery-powered applications, where with the proper setup, it can run low-powered for months at a time — or only hours if done incorrectly. This is the quick and dirty guide to running a Wemos D1 Mini powered by Lithium-Ion batteries: We will be blatantly ignoring several design specifications, so double check everything before using in a critical project. Several things will vary, and since there is plenty of clones of the board some boards will work better than others. Warning: Lithium-Ion batteries always command healthy respect, due to the energy they store! Do not use bad cells, and do not leave batteries unattended in places where a fire can develop, especially while charging."</em> <a href="https://blog.smartere.dk/2022/12/quick-and-dirty-lithium-battery-powered-wemos-d1-mini/">[...]</a>

Not to mention, screwing the two halves back together without pinching any wires is a huge pain and something I don’t take any joy in doing, which is why it hasn’t been opened again since I finished the build. But, it had all the features I wanted to put into it, and I’ve already put many hours of playtime into it.
