<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1786, o engenheiro francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Seguin">Marc Séguin</a>. Ele é o inventor da ponte suspensa com cabo de arame e da caldeira com motor a vapor tubular. Séguin (um sobrinho de Joseph Montgolfier, o balonista pioneiro) desenvolveu um interesse inicial em maquinaria. Em 1822, ele estava a estudar a resistência dos cabos de arame. Com o seu irmão Camille, estudou os princípios da ponte suspensa, na altura construída com cabos de corrente. Em 1824, construíram uma ponte suspensa de cabos de arame paralelos sobre o rio Rhône em Tournon, a primeira ponte deste tipo, depois copiada em todo o mundo. Séguin também melhorou a eficiência da locomotiva com a sua invenção da caldeira de tubos de fogo múltiplos, no lugar da caldeira de tubos de água utilizada pelos primeiros motores a vapor. Os irmãos colaboraram na construção da primeira estrada de ferro francesa (1824-33).</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1818, o inventor alemao-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_G%C3%B6bel">Heinrich Göbel</a>. Ele tinha desenvolvido lâmpadas incandescentes comparáveis às inventadas em 1879 por Thomas Alva Edison. Göbel nunca solicitou uma patente. Em 1893, a Edison Electric Light Company processou três fabricantes de lâmpadas incandescentes por infringir a patente de Edison. A defesa dessas empresas alegou que a patente de Edison foi anulada por causa da mesma invenção de Göbel 25 anos antes, que veio a ser conhecida como a "defesa de Göbel".</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1860, o inventor norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Gordon_Curtis">Charles Gordon Curtis</a>. Ele concebeu uma turbina de vapor amplamente utilizada em centrais eléctricas e em propulsão marítima. Ele foi advogado de patentes durante oito anos. Patenteou a primeira turbina de gás dos Estados Unidos (1899). Entre as suas outras realizações, a turbina de vapor de múltiplos estágios Curtis (patenteada em 1896, vendeu direitos à GE em 1901) exigiu um décimo do espaço e pesou um oitavo tanto quanto as máquinas que substituiu. O gerador Curtis era a turbina de vapor mais potente do mundo e representava um avanço significativo na capacidade das turbinas de vapor. Apesar da sua elevada potência, esta máquina custou muito menos do que os geradores de motores a vapor alternativos contemporâneos com a mesma potência.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1918, o físico sueco <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kai_Siegbahn">Kai Manne Börje Siegbahn</a>. Ele partilhou (com Nicolaas Bloembergen e Arthur L.Schawlow) o Prémio Nobel da Física de 1981 por "a sua contribuição para o desenvolvimento da espectroscopia electrónica de alta resolução". Ele analisou os electrões resultantes que foram eliminados do interior de um átomo por um fotão de raios X de alta energia. Assim, pôde medir a energia de ligação de electrões atómicos com maior precisão do que era possível anteriormente. Além disso, uma vez que essa energia de ligação dependia um pouco do ambiente químico do átomo, isto proporcionou uma nova ferramenta de análise química-ESCA (Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis). A ESCA é agora utilizada por centenas de laboratórios em todo o mundo para investigar reacções de superfície, tais como corrosão ou reacções catalíticas, e outras também de grande importância na química industrial. O seu pai, Karl Manne Georg Siegbahn, recebeu o Prémio Nobel da Física de 1924.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1927, o físico suíço <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._Alex_M%C3%BCller">K. Alex Müller</a>. Ele partilhou (com J. Georg Bednorz) o Prémio Nobel da Física de 1987 pela sua descoberta conjunta da supercondutividade em certas substâncias a temperaturas mais elevadas do que se pensava ser possível alcançar anteriormente. Assustaram o mundo ao relatar a supercondutividade num material cerâmico estratificado a uma temperatura então recorde de 33 graus acima de zero absoluto. A sua descoberta estabeleceu novas pesquisas em todo o mundo sobre materiais relacionados que produziram dezenas de novos supercondutores, acabando por atingir uma temperatura de transição de 135 kelvin.</p>

<p>Em 1902, Pierre e Marie Curie isolaram um grama de cloreto de rádio puro, a primeira amostra do elemento radioactivo. Tinham-no refinado a partir de oito toneladas de minério de pitchblende. Anteriormente, em 1898, os Curies descobriram a radioactividade do pitchblende, que mais tarde identificaram como sendo devida ao rádio e ao polónio. Pelo seu trabalho de isolamento do sal de rádio em 1902, foi-lhe concedido o doutoramento em ciências em Junho de 1903. O Prémio Nobel da Física foi atribuído em 1903, conjuntamente a Marie e ao seu marido, Pierre. Marie continuou o seu trabalho e finalmente conseguiu isolar o rádio puro metálico em 1910. Recebeu o Prémio Nobel da Química em 1911, tornando-se a primeira pessoa a ganhar dois Nobels.</p>

<p><em>"Extending Moore’s Law means putting more transistors on an integrated circuit and, increasingly, adding more cores. Doing so improves performance but requires more energy. Over the past decade, Intel estimates it has saved 1,000 terawatt hours of electricity through the improvements its engineers have made to processors. These advances are complemented by cooling technologies – fans, in-door coolers, direct-to-chip cooling – that further manage heat, conserve energy and reduce carbon emissions. These cooling features require up to 40% of a data center’s energy consumption1. As Intel looks to increase performance in the future, improvements need to be accomplished in an energy-efficient way, and air cooling may not be the solution."</em> <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-dives-into-future-of-cooling.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/news/2023/balance-beam-robot">CMU Team Designs Four-Legged Robotic System That Can Walk a Balance Beam</a></h2>

<p><em>"Researchers in Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute (RI) have designed a system that makes an off-the-shelf quadruped robot nimble enough to walk a narrow balance beam -- a feat that is likely the first of its kind. "This experiment was huge," said Zachary Manchester, an assistant professor in the RI and head of the Robotic Exploration Lab. "I don't think anyone has ever successfully done balance beam walking with a robot before." By leveraging hardware often used to control satellites in space, Manchester and his team offset existing constraints in the quadruped's design to improve its balancing capabilities. The standard elements of most modern quadruped robots include a torso and four legs that each end in a rounded foot, allowing the robot to traverse basic, flat surfaces and even climb stairs. Their design resembles a four-legged animal, but unlike cheetahs who can use their tails to control sharp turns or falling cats that adjust their orientation in mid-air with the help of their flexible spines, quadruped robots do not have such instinctive agility."</em> <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/news/2023/balance-beam-robot">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A viable formula for a carbon-negative, environmentally friendly concrete that is nearly as strong as regular concrete has been developed at Washington State University. In a proof-of-concept work, the researchers infused regular cement with environmentally friendly biochar, a type of charcoal made from organic waste, that had been strengthened beforehand with concrete wastewater. The biochar was able to suck up to 23% of its weight in carbon dioxide from the air while still reaching a strength comparable to ordinary cement. The research could significantly reduce carbon emissions of the concrete industry, which is one of the most energy- and carbon-intensive of all manufacturing industries. The work, led by doctoral student Zhipeng Li, is reported in the journal, Materials Letters. “We’re very excited that this will contribute to the mission of zero-carbon built environment,” said Xianming Shi, professor in the WSU Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and the corresponding author on the paper."</em> <a href="https://news.wsu.edu/press-release/2023/04/18/researchers-develop-carbon-negative-concrete/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The new development is scalable and suitable for use in photonic quantum computers An international team of researchers from Leibniz University Hannover (Germany), the University of Twente (Netherlands), and the start-up company QuiX Quantum has presented an entangled quantum light source fully integrated for the first time on a chip. “Our breakthrough allowed us to shrink the source size by a factor of more than 1000, allowing reproducibility, stability over a longer time, scaling, and potentially mass-production. All these characteristics are required for real-world applications such as quantum processors,” says Prof. Dr. Michael Kues, head of the Institute of Photonics, and board member of the Cluster of Excellence PhoenixD at Leibniz University Hannover. Quantum bits (qubits) are the basic building blocks of quantum computers and the quantum internet. Quantum light sources generate light quanta (photons) that can be used as quantum bits. On-chip photonics has become a leading platform for processing optical quantum states as it is compact, robust, and allows to accommodate and arrange many elements on a single chip."</em> <a href="https://www.uni-hannover.de/en/universitaet/aktuelles/online-aktuell/details/news/erste-vollstaendig-integrierte-quantenlichtquelle-in-chipgroesse-fuer-die-quanten-cloud">[...]</a>

Since our project requires bidirectional communication between our two Argon devices, we decided this would be too simple. As we did more research on the applications of motion sensors and lights with two-way communication, we came up with the idea for a project that would let you wave your hand over a motion sensor to activate a light on another device, and then use a switch to activate the light on the opposite argon, allowing for communication to let others know that you are okay or to send a message."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/iot-project-10/motion-activated-light-communication-device-c1cde5">[...]</a>

In this way, I could ensure the target device would respond correctly after pushing the latest code changes. However, the transmitting microcontroller, typically an Arduino-based board, had to be programmed to send I2C data and print the results upon boot, which also meant any changes made to the controller required a reflash. My goal for this project was to build a device that could perform any kind of I2C-related task without the need for reprogramming if a change were to occur.
