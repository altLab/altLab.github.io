<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1884, o bioquímico polaco-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir_Funk">Casimir Funk</a>. Ele cunhou o termo "vitamina". Em 1912, como tinha sido anteriormente proposto por Sir Frederick Hopkins, Funk insistiu na ideia de que doenças como o beriberi, escorbuto, raquitismo e pelagra eram causadas pela falta de substâncias vitais na dieta. A sua investigação do factor anti-beriberi de Christiaan Eijkman tinha mostrado que se tratava de uma amina (uma substância orgânica com moléculas contendo o grupo -NH2 amina). Funk assumiu (embora incorrectamente) que todas as substâncias semelhantes eram também aminas, e nomeou tais factores como vitaminas ("aminas vivas"). Quando mais tarde se descobriu que nem todos os factores eram aminas, a ortografia da palavra foi alterada para "vitamina". O ácido nicotínico isolado por funk do polimento do arroz, mais tarde utilizado contra pelagra por Warburgh e Elvehjem.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1924, o físico americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_MacLeod_Cormack">Allan MacLeod Cormack</a>. Nascido na África do Sul, ele formulou os algoritmos matemáticos que tornaram possível o desenvolvimento de uma nova e poderosa técnica de diagnóstico, o processo de imagem de raios X transversal conhecido como tomografia axial computorizada (CAT) scanning. Descreveu-o pela primeira vez em dois artigos em 1963 e 1964. A tomografia de raios X é um processo pelo qual uma imagem de uma fatia imaginária através de um objecto (ou do corpo humano) é construída a partir de informação de detectores que giram à volta do corpo. Por este trabalho, foi-lhe atribuída uma parte (com Sir Gregory Hounsfield) do Prémio Nobel de 1979. Cormack foi invulgar no campo dos laureados com o Nobel porque nunca obteve o grau de doutor em medicina ou qualquer outro campo da ciência.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1951, o matemático japonês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigefumi_Mori">Shigefumi Mori</a>. Ele fez importantes contribuições no campo da geometria algébrica. O seu principal trabalho, no qual provou a existência de modelos mínimos para todas as variedades algébricas tridimensionais (Janeiro de 1988), foi apelidado de Programa de Mori. No espaço de dez anos desde o seu primeiro trabalho publicado, Mori tinha assim completado o que muitos disseram nunca poder ser feito. Em 1979, Mori publicou os seus primeiros resultados principais, uma prova da conjectura Hartshorne, que afirmava que uma certa classe de variedades algébricas são projectivas por natureza. Por outras palavras, estas variedades ou conjuntos de soluções para determinadas equações polinomiais poderiam ser descritas utilizando a geometria projectiva. Recebeu a Medalha Fields em 1990 pelo seu trabalho em geometria algébrica.</p>

<p>Em 1947 era fundada a ISO - International Organization for Standardization. Publicou mais de 24.500 normas internacionais que cobrem quase todos os aspectos da tecnologia e do fabrico. Tem 811 comités técnicos e sub-comités para cuidar do desenvolvimento de normas. A organização desenvolve e publica normalização em todos os campos técnicos e não técnicos, à excepção da engenharia eléctrica e electrónica, que é tratada pela IEC.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou foi lançada mais uma versão do Kernel Linux. A versão 6.2 serve um conjunto substancial de novas capacidades de hardware, nomeadamente o apoio out-of-the-box para gráficos Intel Arc e, mantendo-se com a Intel, o apoio ao driver On-Demand da Intel (a sua funcionalidade "in-app purchases for extra CPU features") nas CPUs de 4ª geração Xeon. Os CPUs mais antigas da Intel Skylake ganham um aumento de desempenho com o Call Depth Tracking, uma característica que a Phoronix descreve como uma "atenuação menos dispendiosa" do que a Especulação Restrita Indirecta (IBRS) também concebida para lidar com a vulnerabilidade de execução especulativa Retbleed CPU nestes chips. O driver de de filesystem de NTFS3 e SquashFS têm mais opções, foi adicionado suporte para os comandos DualShock 4 da Sony, o Raspberry Pi passa a suportar 4K @ 60Hz e foram introduzidas mais um conjunto diverso de melhorias em diversas outras partes do kernel.</p>

<p>De assinalar também que este mês o lançamento do KiCad 7. Este software para desenho de PCBs tem ganho popularidade  não só por ser uma ferramenta open-source mas também porque tem vindo a dar resposta às solicitações da comunidade em termos de funcionalidades e correção de problemas. Esta nova versão tem cerca de 6000 modificações, que corrigiram cerca de 1200 problemas e acrescentam muitas outras novidades. De entre as novidades destaca-se a possibilidade de utilização de Fontes customizadas, caixa de texto, gestão automatizada de atualização de plugins, introdução de uma cli, arrastamento ortogonal, ligações a 45º, modo de simulação, melhorias no roteamento de pistas entre outros.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker e alguns vídeos interessantes. São apresentadas as revistas Hackspace Mag nº64 e a MagPI nº127 de Março.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2023/02/linux-kernel-6-2-new-features">Linux Kernel 6.2 Released, This is What’s New</a></h2>

<p><em>" new version of the Linux kernel is available with a collection of important hardware, performance, and security improvements. Announcing the Linux kernel 6.2 release on the Linux kernel developer mailing list (LKML), creator Linus Torvalds urges people to try it out, noting: “Maybe it’s not a sexy LTS release like 6.1 ended up being, but all those regular pedestrian kernels want some test love too.” As you know, the Linux kernel is developed and maintained by a worldwide community of engineers and enthusiasts. While a great number of those who contribute to the Linux kernel do so as part of their day job, many others do it in their free time of their own accord, and on their own terms — and to them we are grateful! With that gratitude in mind, let’s take a closer look at what’s new in Linux 6.2… Linux 6.2: New Features Fittingly for the first kernel release this year, Linux 6.2 serves up a substantial set of new hardware enablement, mostly notably out-of-the-box support for Intel Arc graphics and, staying with Intel, support for Intel’s On-Demand driver (their ‘in-app purchases for extra CPU features’ feature) in 4th-Gen Xeon CPUs. Older Intel Skylake CPUs gain a performance boost with Call Depth Tracking, a feature Phoronix describes as a “less costly mitigation” than the Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (IBRS) also designed to address the Retbleed CPU speculative execution vulnerability on these chips. Linux 6.2 is the first version of the Linux kernel to offer mainline support for the Apple M1 Pro, Max, and Ultra chips as work done by Asahi Linux’s developers was upstreamed."</em> <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2023/02/linux-kernel-6-2-new-features">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The research uses archival NASA data to show that Venus may be losing heat from geologic activity in regions called coronae, possibly like early tectonic activity on Earth. Earth and Venus are rocky planets of about the same size and rock chemistry, so they should be losing their internal heat to space at about the same rate. How Earth loses its heat is well known, but Venus’ heat flow mechanism has been a mystery. A study that uses three-decade-old data from NASA’s Magellan mission has taken a new look at how Venus cools and found that thin regions of the planet’s uppermost layer may provide an answer. Our planet has a hot core that heats the surrounding mantle, which carries that heat up to Earth’s rigid outer rocky layer, or lithosphere. The heat is then lost to space, cooling the uppermost region of the mantle."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/study-finds-venus-squishy-outer-shell-may-be-resurfacing-the-planet">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Experts say adoption of standards within the next few years is essential to help secure telco data and infrastructure from quantum-powered cyberattacks As part of the Post-Quantum Telco Network Taskforce, GSMA has published, with contributions from members IBM, Vodafone, and others, the Post Quantum Telco Network Impact Assessment: an in-depth analysis of the quantum security threats facing the telecommunications industry and a detailed, step by step list of potential solutions to prepare for these threats. The report, which debuted ahead of GSMA’s annual Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, maps out a clear path for telco organizations to work across their ecosystems to protect data from cybercriminals acting today to tap into the potential power of future quantum computers. It includes: A telco-specific assessment of the business risk of quantum cyber threats, including four of the highest impact attack types: store now, decrypt later; code signing and digital signatures; rewriting history; and key management attacks. Discussion of standardization for hardware and software changes, such as SIM cards, public key infrastructure, digital certificates and CPE devices. Specific approaches to quantum-safe algorithms and risk assessment frameworks, including code-based, lattice-based, hash-based, multivariate-based, and hybrid approaches.

NASA’s Perseverance rover will celebrate its second anniversary on the surface of Mars Saturday, Feb. 18. Since arriving at Jezero Crater in 2021, the six-wheeled, nuclear-powered rover has been examining geologic features and collecting samples of the Red Planet that are central to the first step of the NASA-ESA (European Space Agency) Mars Sample Return campaign. Scientists want to study Martian samples with powerful lab equipment on Earth to search for signs of ancient microbial life and to better understand the processes that have shaped the surface of Mars. “Anniversaries are a time of reflection and celebration, and the Perseverance team is doing a lot of both,” said Perseverance project scientist Ken Farley of Caltech in Pasadena. “Perseverance has inspected and performed data collection on hundreds of intriguing geologic features, collected 15 rock cores, and created the first sample depot on another world."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-perseverance-rover-set-to-begin-third-year-at-jezero-crater">[...]</a>

The good news is that analysis of lunar samples returned to Earth in the past by Moonwalkers and robots shows sufficient essential minerals are available for plant growth, apart from nitrogen compounds. The bad news is that lunar soil (or ‘regolith’) compacts in the presence of water, creating problems for plant germination and root growth.

The phenomenon, called Brillouin scattering, has been harnessed by researchers to optomechanically “couple” acoustic waves with light waves. This coupling allows information carried by photons to be transduced, or converted, to the phonons, which travel nearly a million times more slowly than light waves. Opto-acoustic coupling has enabled researchers to read and manipulate the transduced information more easily. To date, however, many of the Brillouin scattering techniques researchers have used rely on standard fiber geometries that cause acoustic waves to die out quickly, limiting the efficacy of the coupling."</em> <a href="https://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/tapered-optical-fiber-addresses-brillouin-scattering-550452/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Development could spark advances in computing, electrochemical, biological systems It’s not easy to make sense of quantum-scale motion, but a new mathematical theory developed by scientists at Rice University and Oxford University could help — and may provide insight into improving a variety of computing, electrochemical and biological systems. The theory developed by Rice theorist Peter Wolynes and Oxford theoretical chemist David Logan gives a simple prediction for the threshold at which large quantum systems switch from orderly motion like a clock to random, erratic motion like asteroids moving around in the early solar system. Using a computational analysis of a photosynthesis model, collaborators at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign showed that the theory can predict the nature of the motions in a chlorophyll molecule when it absorbs energy from sunlight. The theory applies to any sufficiently complex quantum system and may give insights into building better quantum computers. It could also, for instance, help design features of next-generation solar cells or perhaps make batteries last longer. The study is published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences."</em> <a href="https://news.rice.edu/news/2023/theory-can-sort-order-chaos-complex-quantum-systems">[...]</a>

Although the meteoric rise of plastic was the result of its economy and ease of production, the question now is, what do we do with the estimated 380 million tonnes of plastic waste produced globally each year? This wicked problem was something UBC Okanagan’s Dr. Mohammad Arjmand knew he could help solve thanks to the varied expertise and state-of-the-art plastic processing equipment available at the university. “I’ve been working in plastic engineering for almost 15 years, and was mostly using virgin plastic in my research,” explains the School of Engineering Assistant Professor and Canada Research Chair (Tier 2) in Advanced Materials and Polymer Engineering. “But then I thought, what if I could do the same research with recycled plastic?” In Canada, 79 per cent of plastics are dumped in landfills or natural settings, which creates huge social and environmental problems. “I needed to do something for my community, beyond academia, and that’s where the idea first sparked."</em> <a href="https://news.ok.ubc.ca/2023/02/21/finding-new-life-for-plastic-waste/">[...]</a>

The technology transforms sunlight into thermal energy, but it's challenging to suppress energy dissipation while maintaining high absorption. Existing solar energy harvesters that rely on micro- or nanoengineering don't have sufficient scalability and flexibility, and will require a novel strategy for high-performance solar light capture while simultaneously simplifying fabrication and reducing costs. In APL Photonics, from AIP Publishing, researchers from Harbin University, Zhejiang University, Changchun Institute of Optics, and the National University of Singapore designed a solar harvester with enhanced energy conversion capabilities. The device employs a quasiperiodic nanoscale pattern -- meaning most of it is an alternating and consistent pattern, while the remaining portion contains random defects (unlike a nanofabricated structure) that do not affect its performance. In fact, loosening the strict requirements on the periodicity of the structure significantly increases the device's scalability."</em> <a href="https://publishing.aip.org/publications/latest-content/nanoparticles-self-assemble-to-harvest-solar-energy/">[...]</a>

Previous studies of black hole collisions modeled the behavior of the gravitational waves using what is known as linear math, which means that the gravitational waves rippling outward did not influence, or interact, with each other. Now, a new analysis has modeled the same collisions in more detail and revealed so-called nonlinear effects. "Nonlinear effects are what happens when waves on the beach crest and crash" says Keefe Mitman, a Caltech graduate student who works with Saul Teukolsky (PhD '74), the Robinson Professor of Theoretical Astrophysics at Caltech with a joint appointment at Cornell University.

It uses cold air to reduce the growth rate of bacteria and slow down the chemical changes happening inside the food, keeping it fresh for longer. Big household fridges utilize a process that involves the compression and depressurization of a refrigerant, that in turn transfers the heat from inside the fridge to the outside, via the cycles of evaporation and condensation. However, mini-fridges usually work with electricity, making them far less effective than big freezers. But in turn, they are much simpler to make at home, as all you need is insulation foam and a small electronic module.
