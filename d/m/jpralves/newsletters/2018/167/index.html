<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1854, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Eastman">George Eastman</a>. Este inventor e industrial norte-americano foi um fabricante pioneiro de materiais fotográficos, incluindo laminados (patenteado pela primeira vez a 14 de Outubro de 1884) e a câmara Kodak (patenteada a 4 de Setembro de 1888). Ele fundou a Eastman-Kodak Company, que durante anos manteve um monopólio virtual na indústria de câmaras e filmes. A introdução da primeira câmara Kodak (uma palavra cunhada, 1888, que se tornou uma marca registada) ajudou a promover a fotografia amadora em larga escala.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1895, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller">Buckminster Fuller</a>. Este inventor, educador, autor, filósofo, engenheiro e arquitecto norte-americano que desenvolveu a cúpula geodésica. Esta grande cúpula pode ser colocada directamente no solo como uma estrutura completa. Não há limite para o tamanho para o qual ele pode ser construído e reter resistência estrutural suficiente. Fuller também inventou uma ampla gama de outras máquinas de mudança de paradigma e sistemas estruturais. Ele estava especialmente interessado em projectos de alta resistência ao peso, com um máximo de utilidade para o mínimo de material. Os seus projectos e filosofia de engenharia são parte da fundação da estética contemporânea de design de alta tecnologia. Ele detinha mais de 2000 patentes.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1913, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willis_Lamb">Willis Lamb</a>. Este físico norte-americano e vencedor em comum, com Polykarp Kusch, do Prémio Nobel de Física em 1955 "por suas descobertas sobre a estrutura fina do espectro de hidrogénio". O seu trabalho experimental estimulou refinamentos nas teorias quânticas dos fenómenos electromagnéticos.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1928, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elias_James_Corey">Elias James Corey</a>. Este químico orgânico norte-americano, vencedor do Prémio Nobel de Química em 1990 "pelo seu desenvolvimento da teoria e metodologia da síntese orgânica". Ele é conhecido principalmente pelo seu trabalho em análises assistidas por computador de problemas de síntese. Usando a "análise retro-sintética", uma molécula alvo pode ser dividida por etapas reversíveis em compostos mais simples e prontamente disponíveis, o que é muito auxiliado pelo uso de computadores. Corey sintetizou mais de 100 substâncias pela primeira vez, incluindo terpenos (hidrocarbonetos de óleo vegetal) e ginkolide B (um extracto da árvore ginko usado para controlar a asma).</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que a Lockheed Martin criou uma cúpula de titânio impressa em 3-D para tanques de combustível de satélites. O veiculo de 1,16 metros de diâmetro completou as rodadas finais de testes de qualidade este mês, finalizando um programa de desenvolvimento de vários anos para criar tanques gigantes de alta pressão que transportam combustível a bordo de satélites.</p>

<p>Também esta semana, a OPENER, Inc., pioneira em veículos aéreos para viagens de consumidores, revelou hoje o BlackFly; a primeira aeronave ultra-leve de descolagem e aterragem vertical de asa fixa totalmente elétrica ultraleve (VTOL). O BlackFly é um Veículo Aéreo Pessoal (PAV) de assento único projectado e construído para um novo mundo de transporte tridimensional. BlackFly é simples de dominar e não requer licenciamento formal (nos EUA) ou habilidades especiais para operar com segurança. Embora o BlackFly tenha recursos anfíbios completos, ele é projectado principalmente para operar facilmente a partir de pequenas áreas relvadas e percorrer distâncias de até 40 quilómetros a uma velocidade de 100 km/h (restrição dos EUA).</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. É apresentada a revista newelectronics de 10 de Julho de 2018.</p>

<p><em>"Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) has embraced a 3-D printed titanium dome for satellite fuel tanks so big you can't even put your arms around it. The 46-inch- (1.16-meter-) diameter vessel completed final rounds of quality testing this month, ending a multi-year development program to create giant, high-pressure tanks that carry fuel on board satellites. The titanium tank consists of three parts welded together: two 3-D printed domes that serve as caps, plus a variable-length, traditionally-manufactured titanium cylinder that forms the body. "Our largest 3-D printed parts to date show we're committed to a future where we produce satellites twice as fast and at half the cost," said Rick Ambrose, Lockheed Martin Space executive vice president. "And we're pushing forward for even better results. For example, we shaved off 87 percent of the schedule to build the domes, reducing the total delivery timeline from two years to three months.""</em> <a href="https://news.lockheedmartin.com/2018-07-11-Giant-Satellite-Fuel-Tank-Sets-New-Record-for-3-D-Printed-Space-Parts">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.imec-int.com/en/articles/imec-demonstrates-hybrid-finfet-silicon-photonics-technology-for-ultra-low-power-optical-i-o">Imec Demonstrates Hybrid FinFET-Silicon Photonics Technology for Ultra-Low Power Optical I/O</a></h2>

<p><em>"Today at its Imec Technology Forum USA in San Francisco, imec, the world-leading research and innovation hub in nano-electronics and digital technology, announced that it has demonstrated ultra-low power, high-bandwidth optical transceivers through hybrid integration of Silicon Photonics and FinFET CMOS technologies. With a dynamic power consumption of only 230fJ/bit and a footprint of just 0.025mm2, the 40Gb/s non-return-to-zero optical transceivers mark an important milestone in realizing ultra-dense, multi-Tb/s optical I/O solutions for next-generation high-performance computing applications. The exponentially growing demand for I/O bandwidth in datacenter switches and high-performance computing nodes is driving the need for tight co-integration of optical interconnects with advanced CMOS logic, covering a wide range of interconnect distances (1m-500m+). In the presented work, a differential FinFET driver was co-designed with a Silicon Photonics ring modulator, and achieved 40Gb/s NRZ optical modulation at 154fJ/bit dynamic power consumption. The receiver included a FinFET trans-impedance amplifier (TIA) optimized for operation with a Ge waveguide photodiode, enabling 40Gb/s NRZ photodetection with an estimated sensitivity of -10dBm at 75fJ/bit power consumption. High-quality data transmission and reception was also demonstrated in a loop-back experiment at 1330nm wavelength over standard single mode fiber (SMF) with 2dB link margin."</em> <a href="https://www.imec-int.com/en/articles/imec-demonstrates-hybrid-finfet-silicon-photonics-technology-for-ultra-low-power-optical-i-o">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://thehackernews.com/2018/07/intel-spectre-vulnerability.html">Two New Spectre-Class CPU Flaws Discovered-Intel Pays $100K Bounty</a></h2>

<p><em>"Intel has paid out a $100,000 bug bounty for new processor vulnerabilities that are related to Spectre variant one (CVE-2017-5753). The new Spectre-class variants are tracked as Spectre 1.1 (CVE-2018-3693) and Spectre 1.2, of which Spectre 1.1 described as a bounds-check bypass store attack has been considered as more dangerous. Earlier this year, Google Project Zero researchers disclosed details of Variants 1 and 2 (CVE-2017-5753 and CVE-2017-5715), known as Spectre, and Variant 3 (CVE-2017-5754), known as Meltdown. Spectre flaws take advantage of speculative execution, an optimization technique used by modern CPUs, to potentially expose sensitive data through a side channel by observing the system. Speculative execution is a core component of modern processors design that speculatively executes instructions based on assumptions that are considered likely to be true. If the assumptions come out to be valid, the execution continues, otherwise discarded."</em> <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2018/07/intel-spectre-vulnerability.html">[...]</a>

The researchers describe the behavior as lasting about a millionth of a second, which is still a million times slower than traditional electronic recovery times. “We’ve discovered that electrons can be very slow to return to their homes after being kicked out from the ‘ordered states.’” — Haidan Wen, Argonne physicist and co-author “It’s as if the electron is spending two years or more dithering between states when normally it could make up its mind in a minute,” said Anand Bhattacharya, an Argonne materials scientist and co-author of the study, published May 4, in Nature Communications. In a crystal, all the atoms form a periodic structure called a lattice, where the atoms are arranged in a repetitive pattern in three dimensions. The properties of electrons living in this space typically obey the same periodicity.

Due to advantages such as its relatively low thermal conductance but high electric conductance, silicon nanowires have emerged as a promising thermoelectric material. Silicon-based thermoelectric generators conventionally employed long, silicon nanowires of about 10-100 nanometers, which were suspended on a cavity to cutoff the bypass of the heat current and secure the temperature difference across the silicon nanowires. However, the cavity structure weakened the mechanical strength of the devices and increased the fabrication cost.

<p><em>"Researchers from Aalto University are designing nano-sized quantum heat engines to explore whether they may be able to outperform classical heat engines in terms of power and efficiency. In their paper, published in Nature Physics, the group led by Professor Jukka Pekola presents a way to solve a problem in how quantum systems interact and exchange energy with their macroscopic surroundings, and within themselves. The group strives to treat quantum information and thermodynamics on the same footing in their research. ‘We have realised a miniature heat valve in a quantum system composed of an artificial atom, a superconducting qubit—the basic building block of both quantum computing and quantum heat engines,’ explains Professor Pekola. While in quantum computers the qubit has to be decoupled from the noisy external world to sustain a fragile quantum state, in quantum heat engines, the system needs to be coupled to its dissipative surroundings, to heat baths. A particularly puzzling problem is the process of thermalisation when connecting external heat sources or ‘thermal baths’ to a coherent quantum system or qubit."</em> <a href="http://www.aalto.fi/en/current/news/2018-07-09/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Electrical and medical engineering researchers create device that makes it easier to measure pressure inside the eyes of people at risk for glaucoma. Researchers at Caltech have developed an implantable pressure sensor that can reside in the human eye for years at a time while wirelessly sending data about the eye's health to the patient or medical professionals. The implant could make it easier to prevent one of the leading causes of blindness. "By bringing together novel packaging and microelectronic technologies, and in close collaborations with ophthalmologists, we were able to design a miniaturized, fully wireless, and highly-sensitive sensor," says Azita Emami, Caltech's Andrew and Peggy Cherng Professor of Electrical Engineering and Medical Engineering and a Heritage Medical Research Institute Investigator, and paper co-author. The sensor is designed for monitoring the eyes of patients with glaucoma, a disease that causes gradual loss of vision, usually as a result of excessively high pressure inside the eye. Glaucoma is the second-most-common cause of blindness after cataracts, affecting 65 million people worldwide."</em> <a href="http://www.caltech.edu/news/wireless-pressure-sensing-eye-implant-could-help-prevent-blindness-82646">[...]</a>

NIF, the world’s largest and most energetic laser, is funded by NNSA to serve as a critical research facility supporting the U.S science-based Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP). “NIF’s users are always asking to use more energy in their experiments, because higher energies enhance the science NIF can deliver in support of the stewardship program. These results mark a major step toward increasing NIF’s energy and power capability,” said NIF Director Mark Herrmann. “This demonstration serves as the first step on a path that could allow NIF to operate at substantially higher energies than ever envisioned during NIF’s design.” The purpose of this experiment was to demonstrate the highest energy NIF can safely deliver with its current optics and laser configuration."</em> <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/news/nif-sets-new-laser-energy-record">[...]</a>

Thus, heat dissipation is an important issue, and one solution for cooling is to develop novel semiconducting materials with high thermal conductivity.

It is also an electrical insulator. In addition, when paired with a semiconductor device, diamond expands at a different rate than the device does when it is heated. Now, a group of engineers from the Cockrell School of Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin, along with research partners across Texas and the U.S., has found a crystal material from two relatively common elements — boron and arsenic — that demonstrates far higher thermal conductivity than any other semiconductors and metals currently in use, such as silicon, silicon carbide, copper and silver."</em> <a href="http://www.engr.utexas.edu/news/8323-semiconducting-crystal">[...]</a>

Titanium dioxide illuminated by ultraviolet light is often is used as a catalyst, but using ultraviolet light is inefficient. In the study, Rutgers researchers tapped visible and infrared light that allowed gold nanoparticles to absorb it more quickly and then transfer some of the electrons generated as a result of the light absorption to nearby materials like titanium dioxide. The engineers coated gold nanoparticles with titanium dioxide and exposed the material to UV, visible, and infrared light and studied how electrons jump from gold to the material."</em> <a href="https://news.rutgers.edu/how-gold-nanoparticles-could-improve-solar-energy-storage/20180712">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Technology created by researchers at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST) is literally shedding light on some of the smallest particles to detect their presence – and it’s made from tiny glass bubbles. The technology has its roots in a peculiar physical phenomenon known as the “whispering gallery,” described by physicist Lord Rayleigh (John William Strutt) in 1878 and named after an acoustic effect inside the dome of St Paul’s Cathedral in London. Whispers made at one side of the circular gallery could be heard clearly at the opposite side. It happens because sound waves travel along the walls of the dome to the other side, and this effect can be replicated by light in a tiny glass sphere just a hair’s breadth wide called a Whispering Gallery Resonator (WGR). When light is shined into the sphere, it bounces around and around the inner surface, creating an optical carousel. Photons bouncing along the interior of the tiny sphere can end up travelling for long distances, sometimes as far as 100 meters."</em> <a href="https://www.oist.jp/news-center/news/2018/7/11/bubbles-and-whispers-glass-bubbles-boost-nanoparticle-detection">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This is a very precise scale for any weight up to 1.5 kg! This is one of my very first Arduino projects. This is a high precision scale based on the HX711 module. It has different operating modes. It can measure weight in the normal mode. Also features a mode where you can place a coin, the program calculates its weight and then you place as many coins as you want all together or one by one and the scale calculates the amount of money and how many coins were placed."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/mPelectronic/high-precision-scale-with-arduino-6fce6b">[...]</a>

<p><em>"I’ve been working on another music project: it’s a custom-built Arduino-based synthesizer and keyboard called “Pentasynth”. Pentasynth uses a keyboard based on a five note pentatonic scale, so it’s easy to play for people with limited background in music (such as young kids) and encourages experimentation and improvisation. Pentasynth creates a user-selectable accompaniment including different drum patterns, bass lines and chord progressions and allows the user to play a pentatonic melody line over the top. Under the hood, the audio generation is performed using a four channel, 10kHz playback of wavetables (sine, pulse, sawtooth, triangle and random noise) using a micro-controller generated PWM that is then passed through a low-pass filter and into a small amplifier and speaker. The microcontroller is programmed in Arduino, with code based on “The Synth”, a wavetable synth library by DZL/Illustron. Pentasynth has controls for volume, tempo and selection of different accompaniment patterns."</em> <a href="https://randomprojectlab.blogspot.com/2018/06/pentasynth-homebuilt-pentatonic.html">[...]</a>

It is a demanding project for elementary school students and it took us many meetings to accomplish. It contains a small 5V solar panel that can rotate in two axis so as to harvest maximum power from the sun. The project is based on the Dual Axis Solar Tracker Project from OpenSourceClassroom.

This was also perfect timing, as I needed a new one, and had already bought some clock modules ready. This is not the hardest of Instructables to make, but it is one that requires patience and precision - NO CUTTING CORNERS! It should only take a few hours to complete at the most (if you use similar tools to me). "</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Hard-Drive-Clock-1/">[...]</a>

For this propose we will make two units : transmitter and receiver units. In the transmitter units we will use the IR sensor for counting the parts, after we attend the number we need to switch on the lamp using a relay module and send information to receiver unit (administration) using two NRF24L01 modules and we get alarme by message on TFT module and by singing a very famous theme : Game of Thrones.
