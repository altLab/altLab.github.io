<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1750, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aim%C3%A9_Argand">Ami Argand</a>. Este químico suíço ficou conhecido por ter inventado a lâmpada Argand, um queimador de óleo com um pavio tubular dentro de uma chaminé de vidro que induziu uma corrente de ar através de dois tubos de ferro, concêntricos com o pavio, resultando numa melhor combustão. Queima dez vezes mais que uma simples lamparina a óleo, com menos fumo e cheiro. O óleo de colza usado era viscoso, então a alimentação de combustível era fornecida pela gravidade de um vaso elevado. Ele fabricou a lâmpada por apenas alguns anos porque durante a Revolução Francesa as suas fábricas foram destruídas. Em 1793, não tendo nenhuma compensação por suas perdas, Argand mudou-se para Inglaterra. Ele também é conhecido por ajudar os irmãos Montgolfier com seus voos de balão, e pelo seu trabalho para destilarias.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1820, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_John_Macquorn_Rankine">William John Macquorn Rankine</a>. Este engenheiro e físico escocês é um dos fundadores da ciência da termodinâmica, particularmente em referência à teoria dos motores a vapor. Como presidente de engenharia civil e mecânica em Glasgow, ele desenvolveu métodos para resolver a distribuição de força em estrutura armadas. Rankine também escreveu sobre a fadiga no metal de eixos ferroviários, sobre as pressões da Terra na mecânica do solo e a estabilidade das paredes. Ele foi eleito Fellow da Royal Society em 1853. Entre suas obras mais importantes estão o Manual de Mecânica Aplicada (1858), Manual do Motor a Vapor e Outros Movimentadores Primários (1859) e Sobre a Teoria Termodinâmica de Ondas de Distúrbios Longitudinais Finitos.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1891, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard_Northrop">John Howard Northrop</a>. Este Bioquímico americano recebeu (com James B. Sumner e Wendell M. Stanley) o Prémio Nobel de Química em 1946 por purificar e cristalizar com sucesso certas enzimas, permitindo-lhe determinar a sua natureza química. Durante a Primeira Guerra Mundial, ele conduziu pesquisas sobre processos de fermentação adequados para a produção industrial de acetona e álcool etílico. Este trabalho levou a um estudo de enzimas essenciais para a digestão, respiração e processos gerais da vida. Ele cristalizou a pepsina (1930), uma enzima digestiva presente no suco gástrico, e descobriu que é uma proteína, resolvendo assim a disputa sobre a natureza das enzimas. Usando os mesmos métodos químicos, ele isolou o primeiro vírus bacteriano (bacteriófago) e descobriu que é uma nucleoproteína (1938).</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que a Baidu iniciou a produção em volume da Apolong, o primeiro autocarro totalmente autónomo L4 da China. O Apolong, desenvolvido em parceria com o fabricante de autocarros chinês King Long e com a plataforma aberta autónoma Baidu, será colocado em operação comercial em várias cidades chinesas, incluindo Pequim, Shenzhen, Xiongan, Wuhan e Pingtan, na província de Fujian. O volume de produção da Apolong chegou a 100 unidades na sua fábrica em Xiamen, na província de Fujian, sudeste da China.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. É apresentado o primeiro número da revista Micro:Mag assim como o livro Software-Defined Radio for Engineers publicado pela Analog.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.uni-mainz.de/presse/aktuell/5536_ENG_HTML.php">Laser spectroscopy measurements reveal size and shape of the nucleus of nobelium</a></h2>

<p><em>"Precise measurement of the optical excitation of atomic levels in the atomic shell of three isotopes of the heavy element 102 Sizes and shapes of nuclei with more than 100 protons were so far experimentally inaccessible. Laser spectroscopy is an established technique in measuring fundamental properties of exotic atoms and their nuclei. For the first time, this technique was now extended to precisely measure the optical excitation of atomic levels in the atomic shell of three isotopes of the heavy element nobelium, which contain 102 protons in their nuclei and do not occur naturally. This was reported by an international team of scientists from GSI Helmholtzzentrum für Schwerionenforschung, Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (JGU), the Helmholtz Institute Mainz (HIM), TU Darmstadt, KU Leuven in Belgium, the University of Liverpool in the UK und TRIUMF in Vancouver, Canada. Nuclei of heavy elements can be produced at minute quantities of a few atoms per second in fusion reactions using powerful particle accelerators. The obtained results are well described by nuclear models, which suggest the nuclei to have a bubble-like structure with lower density in their center than at their surface."</em> <a href="http://www.uni-mainz.de/presse/aktuell/5536_ENG_HTML.php">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers at Tokyo Tech have developed flexible terahertz imagers based on chemically "tunable" carbon nanotube materials. The findings expand the scope of terahertz applications to include wrap-around, wearable technologies as well as large-area photonic devices. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are beginning to take the electronics world by storm, and now their use in terahertz (THz) technologies has taken a big step forward. Due to their excellent conductivity and unique physical properties, CNTs are an attractive option for next-generation electronic devices. One of the most promising developments is their application in THz devices. Increasingly, THz imagers are emerging as a safe and viable alternative to conventional imaging systems across a wide range of applications, from airport security, food inspection and art authentication to medical and environmental sensing technologies."</em> <a href="https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/news/2018/041828.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Jülich researchers discover a new type of magnetic particle-like object for data storage devices of the future. Jülich, 28 June 2018 - Tiny magnetic vortex structures, so-called skyrmions, have been researched intensively for some time for future energy-efficient space-saving data storage devices. Scientists at Forschungszentrum Jülich have now discovered another class of particle-like magnetic object that could take the development of data storage devices a significant step forward. If skyrmions are used to encode the number "1", then the new objects could be used to encode the number "0". These objects, which are referred to as "chiral magnetic bobbers", are three-dimensional magnetic structures that appear near the surfaces of certain alloys. "For a long time, the unique object for research in the field of chiral magnets was the magnetic skyrmion."</em> <a href="http://www.fz-juelich.de/SharedDocs/Pressemitteilungen/UK/EN/2018/notifications/2018-06-28-magnetic-bobbers.html?nn=721054">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Chemical engineers from ETH Zurich developed a new catalyst for forming a bond between two carbon atoms in a cost-effective and eco-friendly way. This technology could soon make its way into industry. The chemical industry produces not just valuable vitamins, pharmaceuticals, flavours and pesticides, but often a large amount of waste, too. This is particularly true of pharmaceutical and fine-chemical production, where the volume of desired product may be just a fraction of the volume of waste and unsaleable by-products of synthesis. One reason for this is that many chemical reactions make use of catalysts in dissolved form, as Javier Pérez-Ramírez, Professor of Catalysis Engineering, says. Catalysts are substances that accelerate a chemical reaction."</em> <a href="https://www.ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2018/06/efficient-eco-friendly-production-of-fine-chemicals.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.adelaide.edu.au/news/news100922.html">Using light for next-generation data storage</a></h2>

<p><em>"Tiny, nano-sized crystals of salt encoded with data using light from a laser could be the next data storage technology of choice, following research by Australian scientists. The researchers from the University of South Australia and University of Adelaide, in collaboration with the University of New South Wales, have demonstrated a novel and energy-efficient approach to storing data using light. “With the use of data in society increasing dramatically due to the likes of social media, cloud computing and increased smart phone adoption, existing data storage technologies such as hard drive disks and solid state storage are fast approaching their limits,” says project leader Dr Nick Riesen, a Research Fellow at the University of South Australia and Visiting Fellow at the University of Adelaide’s Institute for Photonics and Advanced Sensing (IPAS). “We have entered an age where new technologies are required to meet the demands of 100s of terabyte (1000 gigabytes) or even petabyte (one million gigabytes) storage. One of the most promising techniques of achieving this is optical data storage.” Dr Riesen and University of Adelaide PhD student Xuanzhao Pan developed technology based on nanocrystals with light-emitting properties that can be efficiently switched on and off in patterns that represent digital information. The researchers used lasers to alter the electronic states, and therefore the fluorescence properties, of the crystals."</em> <a href="https://www.adelaide.edu.au/news/news100922.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Like the state animal of New York, the rover-like vehicle uses surroundings to build complex structures, overcome obstacles Autonomous robots excel in factories and other manmade spaces, but they struggle with the randomness of nature. To help these machines overcome uneven terrain and other obstacles, University at Buffalo researchers have turned to beavers, termites and other animals that build structures in response to simple environmental cues, as opposed to following predetermined plans. “When a beaver builds a dam, it’s not following a blueprint. Instead, it’s reacting to moving water. It’s trying to stop the water from flowing,” says Nils Napp, PhD, assistant professor of computer science and engineering in UB’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. “We’re developing a system for autonomous robots to behave similarly."</em> <a href="http://www.buffalo.edu/news/releases/2018/06/017.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Californians do not purchase electric vehicles because they are cool, they buy EVs because they live in a warm climate. Conventional lithium-ion batteries cannot be rapidly charged at temperatures below 50 degrees Fahrenheit, but now a team of Penn State engineers has created a battery that can self-heat, allowing rapid charging regardless of the outside chill. "Electric vehicles are popular on the west coast because the weather is conducive," said Xiao-Guang Yang, assistant research professor in mechanical engineering, Penn State. "Once you move them to the east coast or Canada, then there is a tremendous issue. We demonstrated that the batteries can be rapidly charged independently of outside temperature." When owners can recharge car batteries in 15 minutes at a charging station, electric vehicle refueling becomes nearly equivalent to gasoline refueling in the time it takes."</em> <a href="https://news.psu.edu/story/526756/2018/06/28/research/self-heating-fast-charging-battery-makes-electric-vehicles-climate">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Ultra-short, high-intensity X-ray flashes open the door to the foundations of chemical reactions. Free-electron lasers generate these kinds of pulses, but there is a catch: the pulses vary in duration and energy. An international research team has now presented a solution: Using a ring of 16 detectors and a circularly polarized laser beam, they can determine both factors with attosecond accuracy. Free-electron lasers (FELs) generate extremely short and intense X-ray flashes. Researchers can use these flashes to resolve structures with diameters on the scale of hydrogen atoms. They can thus image biomolecules in extremely high resolution to provide completely new insights into the nano-cosmos of nature."</em> <a href="https://www.tum.de/en/about-tum/news/press-releases/detail/article/34773/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Dramatic improvements have been made to the process of converting carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, to methanol, a fuel and building block for a wide range of everyday materials, according to Penn State researchers. Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are increasing and climate change is becoming a worldwide concern requiring global efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. One approach is to use carbon dioxide as the carbon source in reactions with hydrogen, where the hydrogen is produced from water using renewable energy, and the reaction synthesizes methanol. This will help reduce carbon dioxide emissions and mitigate dependence on fossil fuels. Researchers have advanced the process of converting carbon dioxide into methanol, which contains four parts hydrogen, one part oxygen and one part carbon, by developing a new catalyst that uses a specific formulation of palladium and copper. The theoretical and experimental work, recently published in ACS Catalysis, is the result of years of integrated experimental and computational research conducted in a partnership with Dalian University of Technology in China in conjunction with the Penn State-Dalian Joint Center for Energy Research."</em> <a href="https://news.psu.edu/story/526740/2018/06/28/research/carbon-dioxide-methanol-process-improved-catalyst">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A research team from the State Key Laboratory on Advanced Displays and Optoelectronics Technologies of The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) has developed a new Liquid-crystal display (LCD), which image resolution, energy efficiency as well as color saturation were markedly enhanced, achieving a crucial breakthrough in display technology. Known as Active Matrix Ferroelectric Liquid Crystal Display (FLCD) – this latest technology developed by a research team led by Chair Professor from the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering Prof Kwok Hoi-Sing, will see energy efficiency jumped by 3-5 times, and image resolution enhanced by three times – at a lowered cost. Conventional displays have limited energy efficiency, as color filters block and consume 70% of the backlight and energy. To replace color filters, the team developed a field sequential color technology – enabled by fast ferroelectric liquid crystal, which allows display of color images sequentially in time. This technology relies on human vision to fuse these fast-switching images into a full-color picture, so color filters are no longer necessary. As color filters usually make up 30% of a display’s manufacturing cost, its removal result in a cheaper cost of this higher quality FLCD in comparison to its traditional counterparts."</em> <a href="http://www.ust.hk/about-hkust/media-relations/press-releases/hkust-develops-new-generation-lcd-higher-efficiency-resolution-color-performance/">[...]</a>

Harvard’s Ambulatory Microrobot, known as HAMR, can walk on land, swim on the surface of water, and walk underwater for as long as necessary, opening up new environments for this little bot to explore. This next generation HAMR uses multifunctional foot pads that rely on surface tension and surface tension induced buoyancy when HAMR needs to swim but can also apply a voltage to break the water surface when HAMR needs to sink. This process is called electrowetting, which is the reduction of the contact angle between a material and the water surface under an applied voltage. This change of contact angle makes it easier for objects to break the water surface."</em> <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2018/07/next-generation-robotic-cockroach-can-explore-underwater-environments">[...]</a>

The scheme might also be used in applications such as water filtration, energy storage or sensor technology. The idea of using a liquid medium for computing has been around for decades, and various approaches have been proposed. Among its potential advantages, this approach would require very little material and its soft components could conform to custom shapes in, for example, the human body.

<p><em>"Most naturally occurring materials have a disordered atomic structure that interferes with the propagation of both sound and electromagnetic waves. When the waves come into contact with these materials, they bounce around and disperse – and their energy dissipates according to a highly complex interference pattern, diminishing in intensity. That means it’s virtually impossible to transmit data or energy intact across wave-scattering media and fully leverage the potential of wave technology. For an example, you need look no further than your smartphone – the geolocation function works less well inside buildings where radiofrequency waves scatter in all directions. Other potential applications include biomedical imaging and geological surveying, where it’s important to be able to send waves across highly disordered media. A team of researchers from two labs at EPFL’s School of Engineering, working in association with TU Wien and the University of Crete, has developed a system that allows sound waves to travel across such media with no distortion."</em> <a href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/making-opaque-materials-totally-transparent/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"MIT-developed process could offer nontoxic alternative to environmentally harmful chemicals. Fabrics that resist water are essential for everything from rainwear to military tents, but conventional water-repellent coatings have been shown to persist in the environment and accumulate in our bodies, and so are likely to be phased out for safety reasons. That leaves a big gap to be filled if researchers can find safe substitutes. Now, a team at MIT has come up with a promising solution: a coating that not only adds water-repellency to natural fabrics such as cotton and silk, but is also more effective than the existing coatings. The new findings are described in the journal Advanced Functional Materials, in a paper by MIT professors Kripa Varanasi and Karen Gleason, former MIT postdoc Dan Soto, and two others. “The challenge has been driven by the environmental regulators” because of the phaseout of the existing waterproofing chemicals, Varanasi explains."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2018/coatings-make-natural-fabrics-waterproof-0629">[...]</a>

The results could be useful in the search for suitable magnetocaloric materials for energy-efficient heating and cooling systems. Magnetocaloric materials heat up when they enter a magnetic field, and cool down again when they leave it. This phenomenon can be exploited to produce quiet, energy-efficient, and environmentally friendly heating and cooling devices, but the high cost of materials has however severely hampered its wider application in mass-market products. Scientists have known about this effect for more than 100 years: if the magnetic disorder decreases, that is to say, the magnetic entropy, then the lattice entropy increases and the material heats up. If the magnetic field is removed, the magnetic entropy increases and the material can extract heat from the surroundings."</em> <a href="http://www.fz-juelich.de/SharedDocs/Pressemitteilungen/UK/EN/2018/notifications/2018-06-27-magnetocaloriceffect.html;jsessionid=8F5CBCED97BDDA5D54AC64E685C2F946">[...]</a>

Whisking heat away from the circuitry in a computer’s innards to the outside environment is critical: Overheated computer chips can make programs run slower or freeze, shut the device down altogether or cause permanent damage. As consumers demand smaller, faster and more powerful electronic devices that draw more current and generate more heat, the issue of heat management is reaching a bottleneck. With current technology, there’s a limit to the amount of heat that can be dissipated from the inside out. Researchers at The University of Texas at Dallas and their collaborators at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the University of Houston have created a potential solution, described in a study published online July 5 in the journal Science.

Introduction Current Cost make a range of electricity power meters, including the EnviR that wirelessly connects to a clamp meter for the house supply, these can be picked up relatively cheaply on eBay as well as individual IAM modules for appliances. The Envir displays the power usage and trends on an LCD screen which is nice, however getting this data to the internet for long term monitoring and potentially acting on is a different matter. The Envir doesn't have built in Internet connectivity but Current Cost do sell a NetSmart module that plugs into the Envir, however this only sends the data to CurrentCosts own platform (my.currentcost.com), which leaves a lot to be desired, what I wanted was some way to get my electricity usage data to my preferred IoT platform (Tinamous.com - see my profile for one of the reasons why :-) ), and to use the power of the Photon to do some processing before sending the data. After a little digging I discovered the Currrent Cost Envir monitor uses a simple serial interface via the RJ45 jack, this can also be used to power the Envir unit as well. Just add a Photon (or Electron), a RJ45 lead and some code...."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/TinamousSteve/internet-connected-power-usage-monitor-af175d">[...]</a>

I'm using the Arduino IDE to program my ESP8266, so at the end of my loop, I insert void loop() { // other code in my sketch ESP.deepSleep(60e6); } Which puts the ESP8266 to sleep for 60 seconds, and then reboots, running through my code once more before going back to sleep.
