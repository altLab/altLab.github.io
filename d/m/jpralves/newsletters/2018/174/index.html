<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1852, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobus_Henricus_van_%27t_Hoff">Jacobus Henricus Van't Hoff</a>. Este Químico e físico holandês foi o primeiro vencedor do Prémio Nobel de Química (1901) "em reconhecimento pelos serviços extraordinários que ele prestou pela descoberta das leis da dinâmica química e pressão osmótica em soluções." Na estéreo-química, em 1874, ele identificou as quatro ligações químicas do carbono como tendo um arranjo tetraédrico, que explicou como certas moléculas podem ser arranjadas diferentemente com os mesmos átomos para dar isómero à esquerda e à direita. (Achille Bel chegou independentemente na mesma conclusão mais ou menos na mesma época.) Com relação à pressão osmótica de líquidos, ele derivou leis (1886) para soluções diluídas semelhantes às leis de gases de Robert Boyle e Joseph Gay-Lussac. Estas relações permitiram a determinação experimental do peso molecular de uma substância em solução.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1863, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Prokudin-Gorsky">Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky</a>. Este químico e fotógrafo russo ficou conhecido pelo seu trabalho pioneiro em fotografia colorida e seu esforço para documentar a Rússia do início do século XX. Usando uma câmara escura fornecida pelo czar Nicolau II, Prokudin-Gorsky viajou pelo Império Russo de 1909 a 1915 usando sua fotografia colorida de três imagens para registar muitos dos seus aspectos. Enquanto alguns de seus negativos foram perdidos, a maioria acabou na Biblioteca do Congresso dos EUA após sua morte. A partir de 2000, os negativos foram digitalizados e a cor triplica para cada assunto digitalmente combinada para produzir centenas de imagens coloridas de alta qualidade da Rússia do século passado.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1871, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Rutherford">Ernest Rutherford</a>. Este físico neozelandês-inglês lançou as bases para o desenvolvimento da física nuclear. Ele colaborou com Frederick Soddy no estudo da radioactividade. Em Setembro de 1898, ele datou um artigo nomeando partículas alfa e partículas beta (a radiação gama foi descoberta em 1900 por Paul Villard) no ano seguinte. Em 1905, com Soddy, ele anunciou que o decaimento radioactivo envolve uma série de transformações. Em 1907, com Hans Geiger e Ernest Marsden, ele desenvolveu a experiência de espalhar partículas alfa que levou, em 1911, à descoberta do núcleo atómico. Em 1919 ele conseguiu a divisão artificial de átomos leves. Em 1908 ele foi premiado com o Prémio Nobel de Química.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1884, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Svedberg">Theodor Svedberg</a>. Este químico sueco ganhou o Prémio Nobel de Química de 1926 pelo seu estudo da química de colóides e sua invenção de uma ultra-centrífuga (1923) como uma técnica para investigar os pesos moleculares de moléculas muito grandes. Ele mostrou que os pesos moleculares das proteínas eram muito maiores do que se pensava originalmente (a hemoglobina, por exemplo, tem um peso molecular de cerca de 68.000). Já que as medições de peso repetidamente deram os mesmos valores, o que implica que as partículas tinham um tamanho e composição definidos, Svedberg assim refutou o modelo de Wilhelm Ostwald de conjuntos irregulares de moléculas menores. Svedberg também contribuiu para o desenvolvimento do ciclotron e do processo de eletroforese da análise química.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1907, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mauchly">John Mauchly</a>. Este engenheiro e físico norte-americano, com John P. Eckert inventou (1946) o Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC), o primeiro computador electrónico de utilização genérica. Mauchly inicialmente concebeu a arquitectura do computador e Eckert possuía as habilidades de engenharia para dar vida à ideia. O ENIAC foi desenvolvido para o Departamento de Artilharia do Exército dos EUA como o que provavelmente foi o primeiro computador electrónico de utilização genérica. Era uma máquina vasta, consumia 100 kW de energia eléctrica e continha 18.000 válvulas electrónicas. O seu bem-sucedido computador UNIVAC lançado em 1951 foi o primeiro computador comercial e introduziu fita magnética para programação.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1912, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Mills_Purcell">Edward Mills Purcell</a>. Este físico norte-americano dividiu o Prémio Nobel de Física de 1952 com Felix Bloch pelo desenvolvimento independente da ressonância magnética nuclear (RMN) em líquidos e sólidos. A RMN tornou-se uma poderosa ferramenta amplamente utilizada para estudar a estrutura molecular de materiais puros e a composição de misturas. O método detecta e mede os campos magnéticos dos núcleos atómicos.</p>

<p>Esta semana ficámos a saber que um sistema de condução autónoma esta a ser testado em Táxis no Japão. Um táxi autónomo conseguiu levar os passageiros pelas movimentadas ruas de Tóquio, aumentando a perspectiva de que o serviço esteja pronto a tempo de transportar atletas e turistas entre os locais desportivos e o centro da cidade durante os Jogos Olímpicos de Verão de 2020. A ZMP, empresa que desenvolve a tecnologia de condução autónoma, e a empresa de táxis Hinomaru Kotsu, afirmam que os testes de estrada, que começaram esta semana, são os primeiros do mundo a envolver taxistas sem motorista e passageiros com tarifas pagas.</p>

<p>Também esta semana ficámos a saber que a Tesla planeia abrir seu software de segurança de veículos gratuitamente para outras empresas para um futuro mais seguro e autónomo. Com o aumento esperado de veículos autónomos e mais conectados, surge um risco maior de hackear esses veículos com intenções destrutivas. Elon Musk acha que o software de segurança da Tesla é a melhor solução e ele planeia abrir o código gratuitamente para outras empresas para um futuro mais seguro.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. É apresentada a revista MagPI nº73 de Setembro.</p>

<p><em>"A self-driving taxi has successfully taken paying passengers through the busy streets of Tokyo, raising the prospect that the service will be ready in time to ferry athletes and tourists between sports venues and the city centre during the 2020 Summer Olympics. ZMP, a developer of autonomous driving technology, and the taxi company Hinomaru Kotsu, claim that the road tests, which began this week, are the first in the world to involve driverless taxis and fare-paying passengers. The trial took place as Toyota and the transport giant Uber said they were intensifying efforts to develop a self-driving vehicle, pitting themselves against rival initiatives in Japan, the US and Europe. Toyota will invest $500m in the venture, which will develop vehicles based on the carmakers’ Sienna minivans, with a view to start testing in 2021, the firms said this week. Uber's autonomous driving venture suffered a setback in March when one of its self-driving vans struck and killed a pedestrian during a trial in Arizona. Nissan and the tech firm DeNa tested their Easy Ride robo-vehicle service along a 4.5km set route in the port city of Yokohama earlier this year."</em> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/28/driverless-taxi-debuts-in-tokyo-in-world-first-trial-ahead-of-olympics">[...]</a>

<p><em>"With the upcoming rise of self-driving and more connected vehicles come an increased risk of hacking those vehicles with ill-intent. Elon Musk thinks that Tesla’s vehicle security software is the best solution and he plans to open-source it for free to other automakers for a safer self-driving future. Musk has expressed concerns about hackers gaining access to Tesla system in the past. He said that preventing a ‘fleet-wide hack’ is Tesla’s top security priority. At the National Governors Association last year, Musk gave some more interesting insights into Tesla’s security effort and especially related to once their vehicles become fully autonomous: “I think one of the biggest concern for autonomous vehicles is somebody achieving a fleet-wide hack.” He followed with an interesting example of what someone could do with that kind of access: “In principles, if someone was able to say hack all the autonomous Teslas, they could say – I mean just as a prank – they could say ‘send them all to Rhode Island’ [laugh] – across the United States… and that would be the end of Tesla and there would be a lot of angry people in Rhode Island.” The CEO said that Tesla developed “specialized encryption” for “multiple sub-systems” in the vehicle and they are developing something for drivers to always have “override authority” if your autonomous vehicle starts doing something “wacky.”"</em> <a href="https://electrek.co/2018/08/11/tesla-open-source-vehicle-security-software-free-other-automakers-safe-self-driving-future/">[...]</a>

In line with the strategic direction Caulfield has articulated, GF is reshaping its technology portfolio to intensify its focus on delivering truly differentiated offerings for clients in high-growth markets. GF is realigning its leading-edge FinFET roadmap to serve the next wave of clients that will adopt the technology in the coming years. The company will shift development resources to make its 14/12nm FinFET platform more relevant to these clients, delivering a range of innovative IP and features including RF, embedded memory, low power and more. To support this transition, GF is putting its 7nm FinFET program on hold indefinitely and restructuring its research and development teams to support its enhanced portfolio initiatives. This will require a workforce reduction, however a significant number of top technologists will be redeployed on 14/12nm FinFET derivatives and other differentiated offerings."</em> <a href="https://www.globalfoundries.com/news-events/press-releases/globalfoundries-reshapes-technology-portfolio-to-intensify-focus-on-growing-demand-for-differentiated-offerings">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A basket of sensors buried in the pavement will measure the speed, weight, and trajectory of vehicles that pass over it On 30 August, a startup plans to add its “smart pavement” to an intersection in an industrial corner of Denver. The company has encased assorted electronics within four slabs of concrete and will wedge those slabs into the road between a Pepsi Co. bottling plant and two parking lots. Integrated Roadways says its product, which can deduce the speed, weight, and direction of a vehicle from the basket of sensors buried in the pavement, will face its first real-world test at that discreet Denver junction. The company can then use that data to alert authorities to accidents or prompt officials to reconfigure lanes to relieve congestion. It’s one approach to so-called “smart roads,” which aim to combine sensing and intelligence in ways that reduce the hazards and hassles of vehicular travel. If all goes well in that first test, Integrated Roadways will replace 500 meters of pavement along a dangerous curve in Highway 285, just south of Denver, with its product in early 2019."</em> <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/infrastructure/colorado-prepares-to-install-smart-road-product-by-integrated-roadways">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://home.cern/about/updates/2018/08/awake-successfully-accelerates-electrons">AWAKE successfully accelerates electrons</a></h2>

<p><em>"Early in the morning on Saturday, 26 May 2018, the AWAKE collaboration at CERN successfully accelerated electrons for the first time using a wakefield generated by protons zipping through a plasma. A paper describing this important result was published in the journal Nature today. The electrons were accelerated by a factor of around 100 over a length of 10 metres: they were externally injected into AWAKE at an energy of around 19 MeV (million electronvolts) and attained an energy of almost 2 GeV (billion electronvolts). Although still at a very early stage of development, the use of plasma wakefields could drastically reduce the sizes, and therefore the costs, of the accelerators needed to achieve the high-energy collisions that physicists use to probe the fundamental laws of nature. The first demonstration of electron acceleration in AWAKE comes only five years after CERN approved the project in 2013 and is an important first step towards realising this vision. AWAKE, which stands for “Advanced WAKEfield Experiment”, is a proof-of-principle R&amp;D project investigating the use of protons to drive plasma wakefields for accelerating electrons to higher energies than can be achieved using conventional technologies."</em> <a href="https://home.cern/about/updates/2018/08/awake-successfully-accelerates-electrons">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Allegro MicroSystems has released a fully integrated, small form factor, power monitoring IC with reinforced voltage isolation. Allegro’s ACS724 and ACS711 current sensor ICs are commonly used in internet connected power outlets and other IOT devices. The ACS71020 improves upon these popular ICs by including power sensing functions and by eliminating power and isolation components that would otherwise increase the cost and the size of customer systems. The ACS71020 IC builds upon our innovative Hall-effect current sensor IC technology by adding line voltage sensing (to voltage levels > 500 VRMS) and a dedicated metrology engine that digitally calculates detected power levels. This enables the first power monitor IC that can be powered from the same voltage supply as the system microprocessor, without needing digital isolators or multiple power supplies. Allegro’s new power monitor IC simplifies common power measurements by offering digital computation of parameters including active, reactive and apparent power."</em> <a href="https://www.allegromicro.com/en/About-Allegro/News-Room/2018/ACS71020-Press-Release.aspx">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A planet-encircling dust storm on Mars, which was first detected May 30 and halted operations for the Opportunity rover, continues to abate. With clearing skies over Opportunity's resting spot in Mars' Perseverance Valley, engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, believe the nearly 15-year-old, solar-powered rover will soon receive enough sunlight to automatically initiate recovery procedures -- if the rover is able to do so. To prepare, the Opportunity mission team has developed a two-step plan to provide the highest probability of successfully communicating with the rover and bringing it back online. "The Sun is breaking through the haze over Perseverance Valley, and soon there will be enough sunlight present that Opportunity should be able to recharge its batteries," said John Callas, Opportunity project manager at JPL. "When the tau level [a measure of the amount of particulate matter in the Martian sky] dips below 1.5, we will begin a period of actively attempting to communicate with the rover by sending it commands via the antennas of NASA's Deep Space Network. Assuming that we hear back from Opportunity, we will begin the process of discerning its status and bringing it back online.""</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7227">[...]</a>

<p><em>"One of the oldest, most versatile and inexpensive of materials — paper — seemingly springs to life, bending, folding or flattening itself, by means of a low-cost actuation technology developed at Carnegie Mellon University's Human-Computer Interaction Institute. A thin layer of conducting thermoplastic, applied to common paper with an inexpensive 3D printer or even painted by hand, serves as a low-cost, reversible actuator. When an electrical current is applied, the thermoplastic heats and expands, causing the paper to bend or fold; when the current is removed, the paper returns to a pre-determined shape. "We are reinventing this really old material," said Lining Yao, assistant professor in the HCII and director of the Morphing Matter Lab, who developed the method with her team. "Actuation truly turns paper into another medium, one that has both artistic and practical uses."

Like the "millennium" math challenges put forth by the Clay Mathematics Institute in 2000, the idea behind these problems was to record some of the most perplexing unsolved puzzles in mathematical physics—a field that uses rigorous mathematical reasoning to address physics questions. So far, the problem undertaken by Michalakis is the only one fully solved, while another has been partially solved.

Flawed parts printed from stolen design files could produce dire results: experts predict that by 2021, 75 percent of new commercial and military aircraft will fly with 3D-printed engine, airframe, and other components, and the use of AM in the production of medical implants will grow by 20 percent per year over the next decade.

Wang’s end goal is to use single molecules as the main building blocks for creating functional electronic circuitry. “With single molecules at the heart of their circuitry, computers and other electronics will be smaller and faster with greater storage efficiency and signal processing,” Wang says. “One of the holdups today in making molecular electronics is that there’s not a definitive way to construct a metal electrode junction with nanometer gaps that can be reliably reproduced.” “Microelectronics are reaching the limit of miniaturization through lithographic techniques that create circuits by transferring polymers, top-down, onto a substrate — like silicon,” Wang says. “To build these complex transistors, the transfer steps are repeated at least 10 times, but usually, 20 to 30 times.” The new, bottom-up methods that Wang will deploy would create metal electrode junctions using templates of synthetic DNA origami nanostructures."</em> <a href="http://news.mst.edu/2018/08/st-researcher-designs-dna-assembled-electronic-circuits-for-miniaturization-of-computers/">[...]</a>

Graphene based products are being designed to be interfaced with the human body within the Graphene Flagship, including flexible biomedical electronic devices. If graphene is to be used for such biomedical applications, it should be biodegradable and thus be expelled from the body. To test how graphene behaves within the body, Alberto Bianco and his team at Graphene Flagship partner CNRS, conducted several tests looking at if and how graphene was broken down with the addition of a common human enzyme. The enzyme in question, myeloperoxidase (MPO), is a peroxide enzyme released by neutrophils, cells that are responsible for the elimination of any foreign bodies or bacteria that enter the body, found in the lungs. If a foreign body or bacteria is detected inside of the body, neutrophils surround it and secrete MPO, thereby destroying the threat."</em> <a href="https://graphene-flagship.eu/biodegradable-graphene">[...]</a>

Detecting infrared light is of major importance for current applications in spectroscopy, materials processing, chemical, bio-molecular and environmental sensing, security and industry since the mid-infrared spectral region is the range where characteristic vibrational transitions and rotational excitations of many important molecules occur. These vibrational and rotational excitations of many molecules, including hazardous and biological molecules, have frequencies that lie precisely in the mid-infrared, which can be monitored by observing the absorption of light in this specific spectral range. However, currently available mid-infrared detectors are very inefficient, except those that can operate at cryogenic temperatures, because they incorporate superconducting elements. Thus, this low temperature limitation is a major drawback in having detectors integrated in devices for consumer products. Now, in a recent study published in Nature Materials, ICFO researcher Renwen Yu, led by ICREA Prof. at ICFO Javier García de Abajo, in collaboration with Prof. Fengnian Xia’s group Yale University, have demonstrated that graphene can be used to fabricate very efficient mid-infrared detectors operating at room temperature."</em> <a href="https://www.icfo.eu/newsroom/news/4093-graphene-as-an-infrared-detector">[...]</a>

I wanted to see if the temperature change could be exploited to make a useful and very low cost sensor, and as you'll see over the next few pages it was quite simple, with only one other component required.
