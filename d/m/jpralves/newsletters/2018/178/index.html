<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1818, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Kolbe">Hermann Kolbe</a>. Este químico alemão realizou a primeira síntese geralmente aceite de um composto orgânico a partir de materiais inorgânicos. Enquanto trabalhava no seu doutorado, ele também conseguiu produzir ácido acético a partir de compostos inorgânicos, o que, de acordo com as doutrinas do vitalismo, era impossível. Em 1859, ele conseguiu usar fenol e dióxido de carbono para produzir ácido salicílico, o que levou à produção mais barata de ácido acetilsalicílico, ou aspirina. As duas reacções vieram a ser chamadas de síntese de Kolbe.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1849, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Pavlov">Ivan Pavlov</a>. Este Fisiologista russo foi agraciado com o Prémio Nobel de 1904 em Fisiologia ou Medicina. Ele foi o pioneiro da investigação que ele designou de "reflexo condicionado". Na experiência que o tornou famoso, ele treinou um cachorro faminto para associar o som de um sino ao receber comida. Depois disso, o cachorro salivaria ao ouvir o sino sozinho. Este trabalho começou como um mero estudo da digestão, com uma série de experiências em cães para investigar como as secreções digestivas são reguladas. Ele identificou três estímulos que causaram cães a começar a salivar: ver, cheirar ou saborear comida. Ele percebeu que a digestão é parcialmente controlada por estímulos sensoriais. Em 1903, Pavlov publicou seus resultados sobre essa aprendizagem - "reflexo condicionado" (em oposição a um reflexo inato, como uma reacção à dor).</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1918, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Ryle">Martin Ryle</a>. Este radioastronomo inglês trabalhou no radar para a defesa britânica em tempo de guerra. Após a Segunda Guerra Mundial, ele tornou-se um líder no desenvolvimento da radioastronomia, projectando sistemas de radiotelescópios revolucionários para usar na localização precisa de fontes de rádio fracas. Com a sua técnica de síntese de abertura de interferometria, ele e sua equipa localizaram regiões de emissão de rádio no sol e identificaram outras fontes de rádio para que pudessem ser estudadas sob luz visível. Ryle observou as galáxias mais distantes conhecidas do universo. Os seus catálogos de fontes de rádio 1C-5C de Cambridge levaram à descoberta de numerosas galáxias de rádio e quasares. Pela sua técnica de síntese de abertura, Ryle dividiu o Prémio Nobel de Física de 1974 (com Antony Hewish), o primeiro reconhecimento de pesquisa astronómica.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou os dois primeiros rovers transportados pela nave Hayabusa 2 operada pela agência japonesa JAXA começaram a explorar a superfície do asteróide 162173 Ryugu. Este asteróide tem aproximadamente 1 km de diâmetro. Os rovers 1A e 1B cada um com cerca de um 1 Kg começaram a enviar imagens da superfície do asteróide captadas a partir das suas câmaras especiais. Este asteróide pensa-se que seja uma relíquia remanescente dos primeiros dias do nosso Sistema Solar, o seu estudo poderá esclarecer a origem e a evolução do nosso próprio planeta.</p>

<p>Também esta semana a MHI Vestas apresentou o seu sistema eólico V164. Sendo uma plataforma colocada no mar os números são impressionantes. Tem um rotor com o diâmetro de 164 metros e pás de 80 metros, pesando cada uma 35 toneladas. Uma turbina tem a capacidade de alimentar cerca de 5,977 casas alemãs.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. São apresentadas as revistas MagPi nº74 e a newelectronics de 25 de Setembro.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/about/media-center/press-item.html/p4081.html">STMicroelectronics Unveils Highly Integrated Mobile-Security Chip Combining NFC Controller, Secure Element, and eSIM</a></h2>

<p><em>"STMicroelectronics, a global semiconductor leader serving customers across the spectrum of electronics applications, revealed its highly integrated mobile-security solution, the ST54J , a system-on-chip (SoC) containing an NFC (Near-Field Communication) controller, Secure Element, and eSIM. The SoC delivers performance-boosting integration for mobile and IoT devices, with the added benefit of ST’s software-partner ecosystem for smoother user experiences in mobile payments and e-ticketing transactions, as well as more convenient, remote, mobile provisioning to support multiple operator subscriptions. “As mobile devices require more security and connectivity in an ever-shrinking PCB footprint, the ST54J will help designers simplify assembly and reduce bill-of-material costs,” said Laurent Degauque, Marketing Director, Secure Microcontroller Division, STMicroelectronics. “ST’s established ecosystem of third-party software partners provides access to eSIM and eSE solutions that are not only EMVCo and GSMA-SAS certifiable, but also tested for interoperability and validated with numerous Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), custom profiles and application providers worldwide.” Spearheading the fourth generation of ST’s proven embedded Secure Element family, the single-chip ST54J ensures faster contactless interaction than a discrete chipset by eliminating performance-limiting off-chip data exchanges between the Secure Element and NFC controller. In addition, a faster, state-of-the-art core for each function further accelerates contactless transactions with mobile terminals and enhances roaming by supporting secure-element cryptographic protocols used worldwide, including FeliCa® and MIFARE®. Packaging and design flexibility comes from the space savings of integrating three key functions onto a single chip."</em> <a href="https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/about/media-center/press-item.html/p4081.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/view-from-the-valley/computing/hardware/david-patterson-says-its-time-for-new-computer-architectures-and-software-languages">David Patterson Says It's Time for New Computer Architectures and Software Languages</a></h2>

<p><em>"Moore’s Law is over, ushering in a golden age for computer architecture, says RISC pioneer David Patterson—University of California professor, Google engineer, and RISC pioneer—says there’s no better time than now to be a computer architect. That’s because Moore’s Law really is over, he says: “We are now a factor of 15 behind where we should be if Moore’s Law were still operative. We are in the post–Moore’s Law era.” This means, Patterson told engineers attending the 2018 @Scale Conference held in San Jose last week, that “we’re at the end of the performance scaling that we are used to. When performance doubled every 18 months, people would throw out their desktop computers that were working fine because a friend’s new computer was so much faster.” But last year, he said, “single program performance only grew 3 percent, so it’s doubling every 20 years. If you are just sitting there waiting for chips to get faster, you are going to have to wait a long time.” For a computer architect like Patterson, this is actually good news. It’s also good news for innovative software engineers, he pointed out."</em> <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/view-from-the-valley/computing/hardware/david-patterson-says-its-time-for-new-computer-architectures-and-software-languages">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/news/news_releases/release.sfe?id=2630">Scientists use artificial neural networks to predict new stable materials</a></h2>

<p><em>"Artificial neural networks—algorithms inspired by connections in the brain—have “learned” to perform a variety of tasks, from pedestrian detection in self-driving cars, to analyzing medical images, to translating languages. Now, researchers at the University of California San Diego are training artificial neural networks to predict new stable materials. “Predicting the stability of materials is a central problem in materials science, physics and chemistry,” said senior author Shyue Ping Ong, a nanoengineering professor at the UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering. “On one hand, you have traditional chemical intuition such as Linus Pauling’s five rules that describe stability for crystals in terms of the radii and packing of ions. On the other, you have expensive quantum mechanical computations to calculate the energy gained from forming a crystal that have to be done on supercomputers. What we have done is to use artificial neural networks to bridge these two worlds.” By training artificial neural networks to predict a crystal’s formation energy using just two inputs—electronegativity and ionic radius of the constituent atoms—Ong and his team at the Materials Virtual Lab have developed models that can identify stable materials in two classes of crystals known as garnets and perovskites."</em> <a href="http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/news/news_releases/release.sfe?id=2630">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Lithium-based battery could make use of greenhouse gas before it ever gets into the atmosphere. A new type of battery developed by researchers at MIT could be made partly from carbon dioxide captured from power plants. Rather than attempting to convert carbon dioxide to specialized chemicals using metal catalysts, which is currently highly challenging, this battery could continuously convert carbon dioxide into a solid mineral carbonate as it discharges. While still based on early-stage research and far from commercial deployment, the new battery formulation could open up new avenues for tailoring electrochemical carbon dioxide conversion reactions, which may ultimately help reduce the emission of the greenhouse gas to the atmosphere. The battery is made from lithium metal, carbon, and an electrolyte that the researchers designed. The findings are described today in the journal Joule, in a paper by assistant professor of mechanical engineering Betar Gallant, doctoral student Aliza Khurram, and postdoc Mingfu He."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2018/new-lithium-battery-convert-carbon-dioxide">[...]</a>

In a talk at the Heidelberg Laureate Forum in Germany, Atiyah will present what he refers to as a “simple proof” of the Riemann hypothesis, a problem which has eluded mathematicians for almost 160 years. Born in 1929, Atiyah is one of the UK’s most eminent mathematical figures, having received the two awards often referred to as the Nobel prizes of mathematics, the Fields medal and the Abel Prize. He also, at various times, served as president of the London Mathematical Society, the Royal Society and the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

Among other things, the hypothesis is intimately connected to the distribution of prime numbers, those indivisible by any whole number other than themselves and one."</em> <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2180406-famed-mathematician-claims-proof-of-160-year-old-riemann-hypothesis">[...]</a>

However, this information is still far from those of the human hand in terms of naturalness and effectiveness. The solution to this important clinical and scientific problem is in a new research published on Neuron, one of the most prestigious journals in the field of neuroscience, by a group of researchers of the Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies, of the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), of the University of Freiburg in Germany and of the Policlinico Gemelli in Rome. The working group coordinated by Prof. Silvestro Micera, professor of Bioengineering at the BioRobotics Institute of the Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, and Bertarelli Chair in Translational Neuroengineering at the EPFL, has in fact developed a code capable of transmit for the first time to the nerves of the amputated arm all the variety of perceptions that it would have received from the nerve fibers connected to the tactile receptors of one's hand and then communicate the information useful for the movement in an extremely natural way. The study, entitled "Biomimetic intraneural sensory feedback enhances sensation naturalness, tactile sensitivity and manual dexterity in a bidirectional prosthesis", opens up new scenarios in the research on artificial prostheses and their ability to recover as much as possible the naturalness of the missing limb. Through an interdisciplinary approach, which integrates practices deriving from neuroengineering, clinical neurology, and robotics, with computer simulations of the behavior of neurons, it was possible to ascertain that by stimulating the peripheral nerve with information very similar to those that natural finger sensors would provide under normal conditions, the patient is able to receive more natural and effective information."</em> <a href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/another-step-towards-the-hand-prosthesis-of-the-fu/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"An innovation in liquid metal chemistry could help one tenth of the planet’s population get access to clean drinking water at very low cost following breakthrough research from UNSW Sydney and RMIT. UNSW and RMIT researchers have discovered a revolutionary and cheap way to make filters that can turn water contaminated with heavy metals into safe drinking water in a matter of minutes. Recent UNSW SHARP hire Professor Kourosh Kalantar-zadeh and his former colleagues at RMIT showed that nano-filters made of aluminium oxide could be cheaply produced using virtually no energy from a fixed amount of liquid metal gallium. In a paper published in Advanced Functional Materials, lead author Dr Ali Zavabeti (RMIT) and Professor Kalantar-zadeh explained that when a chunk of aluminium is added to the core of liquid gallium at room temperature, layers of aluminium oxide are quickly produced at the surface of the gallium. The authors discovered that these aluminium oxide nano-sheets were highly porous and went on to prove they were suitable for filtering both heavy metal ions and oil contamination at unprecedented, ultra-fast rates. Professor Kalantar-zadeh, who was recently awarded an ARC Australian Laureate Fellowship soon after joining UNSW's School of Chemical Engineering, said that low cost and portable filters produced by this new liquid metal based manufacturing process could be used by people without access to clean drinking water to remove substances like lead and other toxic metals in a matter of minutes."</em> <a href="http://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/science-tech/liquid-metal-discovery-make-toxic-water-safe-and-drinkable">[...]</a>

Jamison, head of MIT’s Department of Chemistry and one of the leaders of the research team. This system could cut the amount of time required to optimize a new reaction, from weeks or months down to a single day, the researchers say.

New research from MIT’s interdisciplinary Quantum Engineering Group (QEG) is addressing one of the fundamental challenges facing these quantum sensor systems: removing environmental noise from the signal being measured. The root of the problem, explains QEG doctoral student David Layden, is the extreme sensitivity of quantum sensors to their surrounding environment.

Minuscule external forces induce a phase variation between the two states that can be leveraged to measure physical quantities like temperature, motion, and electric and magnetic fields with unprecedented resolution."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2018/mit-phd-student-david-layden-honing-quantum-sensing-0925">[...]</a>

<p><em>"I created this prop 2 years ago; these photos had been waiting a while before they became the Instructable they were originally purposed for :) My true inspiration for this decoration, came from the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland. As you returned to the station (dock?) your boat was carried up a large conveyor belt, and in doing so, passed by a dark, dungeon-like crawlspace which contained several pairs of eerie-looking, red glowing eyes, which blinked randomly every few seconds or so. (It might not still be there though, I haven't been to D-land in years. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if they had replaced it with Queen Elsa in a lightsaber-duel with Darth Vader....) First of all, many of the methods and materials I used can be substituted for other ones. However it's up to you to figure out any modifications, as I can only show my own example of how I did it."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Glowing-Demon-Eyes-That-Can-Blink/">[...]</a>

<p><em>""Lottery Winner" for Arduino creates a sequence of non-repeating pseudo-random numbers for lottery or other applications. Story 1) Introduction One of the first projects I have done by myself for Arduino was a random number generator. That is good for beginners because the logic/code is very simple using basic Arduino functions. But in this case, some numbers in a random sequence can be repeated and this works for a dice game, for example, but not for lotteries. For this upgraded version I have introduced new features such as shuffling and sorting routines. Now is possible to setup the range of numbers (from 1 to 99) and also the set of non-repeated draw numbers (from 1 to 10)."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/lagsilva/lottery-winner-non-repeating-random-numbers-for-arduino-5a5609">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A CNC Hot-wire cutter is an awesome tool to have when you are building aeroplanes out of foam. It allows the ability to cut out any aerofoil shape from a CAD design accurately. A properly configured machine can save you a lot of effort and produce a smooth finish. The machine has a Nichrome wire stretched between two towers. The wire is heated by passing current through it and the towers move relative to each other to define the shape of the cut. The 2D CAD design to be cut out is turned into G-code and fed to the machine, which moves in four independent axes to create complex contours like tapered wings."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/4-Axis-CNC-Hot-wire-Foam-Cutter-ArduinoRamps14/">[...]</a>

Each “experiment” will show you how to wire up an example circuit and then control it using MicroPython. What is MicroPython? MicroPython is a lean implementation of the Python 3 programming language that has been pared down to run efficiently on microcontrollers. Python is a relatively simple (but powerful) language that is easy for beginners to pick up and has been gaining popularity in schools as an introductory language. MicroPython has nearly all of the features of Python, which means that interacting with hardware is now easily accessible to beginners and seasoned Python programmers alike."</em> <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/micropython-programming-tutorial-getting-started-with-the-esp32-thing/all">[...]</a>
