<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1868, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_S._Firestone">Harvey S. Firestone</a>. Ele foi um industrial norte-americano que desenvolveu pneus pneumáticos rectilíneos usados nos modelos T Fords. No seu início de carreira, a partir de 1893, ganhava a vida vendendo buggies em Detroit, Michigan. Posteriormente, mudou-se para Akron, Ohio, e fundou a Firestone Tire and Rubber Company em 1900. O seu sucesso cresceu quando, em 1906, juntou-se a Henry Ford para fornecer pneus para seus populares carros Modelo T. No final dos anos 1930, quase um quarto de todos os pneus usados nos Estados Unidos eram fabricados pela Firestone. As suas inovações na indústria mudaram o design e a produção de pneus, incluindo bandejas antiderrapantes, pneus de balão de baixa pressão e pneus de tratores agrícolas.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1890,  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaroslav_Heyrovsk%C3%BD">Jaroslav Heyrovský</a>. Este Químico checoslovaco recebeu o Prémio Nobel da Química de 1959  "pela sua descoberta e desenvolvimento dos métodos de análise polarográfica" (1922), que é uma das técnicas analíticas mais versáteis. Aplica-se o princípio de que na electrólise os iões são descarregados num eléctrodo e, se o eléctrodo for pequeno, a corrente pode ser limitada pela taxa de movimento de iões para a superfície do elétrodo. Na polarografia, o cátodo é uma pequena gota de mercúrio (constantemente a formar-se e caindo para manter a superfície limpa). A tensão é aumentada lentamente e a corrente é traçada contra a tensão. A corrente aumenta em etapas, cada uma correspondendo a um tipo particular de ião positivo na solução. A altura das etapas indica a concentração do ião.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1901, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_J._Van_de_Graaff">Robert J. Van de Graaff</a>. Este Físico norte- americano é o inventor do gerador Van de Graaff, um tipo de gerador electrostático de alta tensão que pode ser usado como acelerador de partículas em pesquisa atómica. As diferenças de potencial alcançadas nos modernos geradores Van de Graaff podem ser de até 5 MV. É um princípio de campos eléctricos que cargas em uma superfície podem saltar em pontos onde a curvatura é grande, isto é, onde o raio é pequeno. Assim, uma cúpula de grande raio inibe a descarga eléctrica e a carga adicional pode atingir uma alta tensão. Este gerador tem sido usado em aplicações médicas (como produção de raios X de alta energia) e industriais (esterilização de alimentos). Na década de 1950, Van de Graaff inventou o transformador de núcleo isolante capaz de produzir corrente contínua de alta tensão.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que a NASA colocou na superfície de Marte o primeiro instrumento a partir da sonda InSight completando uma milestone muito importante. Novas imagens da sonda mostram o sismógrafo no chão, sua cobertura cor de cobre levemente iluminada no crepúsculo marciano. Parece que tudo está calmo e tudo é brilhante para a InSight a caminho do final do ano.</p>

<p>Também esta semana Elon Musk revela túnel da Boring Company, prometendo uma nova era no transporte de alta velocidade. Com um Tesla Model X modificado atravessando um túnel da Boring Company na noite de terça-feira, Elon Musk mostrou a visão de um sistema de túneis de alta velocidade que acredita poder aliviar o congestionamento e revolucionar a maneira como milhões de passageiros circulam pelas cidades.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como alguns modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis. É apresentada a revista MagPI nº 77 Dezembro, a revista Hackspace Nº14, o livro "The Official Raspberry Pi Beginner's Guide" e o livro "Makerspace Playbook - School Edition".</p>

<p>Estando em plena época natalícia resta-me desejar a todos em meu nome e em nome do altLab votos de um excelente Natal com muitas prendas no sapatinho.</p>

<p><em>"NASA's InSight lander has deployed its first instrument onto the surface of Mars, completing a major mission milestone. New images from the lander show the seismometer on the ground, its copper-colored covering faintly illuminated in the Martian dusk. It looks as if all is calm and all is bright for InSight, heading into the end of the year. "InSight's timetable of activities on Mars has gone better than we hoped," said InSight Project Manager Tom Hoffman, who is based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. "Getting the seismometer safely on the ground is an awesome Christmas present." The InSight team has been working carefully toward deploying its two dedicated science instruments onto Martian soil since landing on Mars on Nov. 26."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7310">[...]</a>

<p><em>"With a modified Tesla Model X zipping through a Boring Company tunnel Tuesday night, Elon Musk took the wraps off his vision of a high-speed tunnel system he believes could ease congestion and revolutionize how millions of commuters get around cities. “I thought it was epic,” said Musk as he described how he felt being whisked through the Boring Co.‘s demonstration tunnel. “For me it was an epiphany, like ‘this thing damn well worked.’” Musk, who founded the Boring Co. two years ago after complaining that traffic in Los Angeles was driving him “nuts,” says the demonstration tunnel cost approximately $10 million to complete. Engineers and workers have been boring the 1.14-mile-long tunnel underneath one of the main streets in Hawthorne, California. One end of the tunnel starts in a parking lot owned by Musk’s Space X. The other end of the demonstration tunnel is in a neighborhood about a mile away in Hawthorne."</em> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/19/elon-musk-unveils-boring-company-tunnel.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"An adolescent star in the midst of a dramatic growth phase has been observed with the help of two NASA space telescopes. The youngster belongs to a class of stars that gain mass when matter swirling around the star falls onto its surface. The in-falling matter causes the star to appear about 100 times brighter. Astronomers have found only 25 stars in this class, and only about half of those have been observed during an outburst. The new findings shed light on some long-standing mysteries surrounding the evolution of young stars, including how they acquire all of their mass. This rarely observed outbursting behavior could be common but might typically be hidden from our view by thick clouds of dust."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7308">[...]</a>

<p><em>"After months of delays, the U.S. Air Force is about to launch the first of a new generation of GPS satellites, designed to be more accurate, secure and versatile. But some of their most highly touted features will not be fully available until 2022 or later because of problems in a companion program to develop a new ground control system for the satellites, government auditors said. The satellite is scheduled to lift off Tuesday from Cape Canaveral, Florida, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. It's the first of 32 planned GPS III satellites that will replace older ones now in orbit. Lockheed Martin is building the new satellites outside Denver. GPS is best-known for its widespread civilian applications, from navigation to time-stamping bank transactions."</em> <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/us-air-force-set-launch-1st-generation-gps-59849326">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Unity, the same company whose 3D gaming engine brought you _Cuphead</em> and <em>Hearthstone</em> is now helping Chinese internet giant Baidu develop the next generation of autonomous vehicles, the two companies announced on Tuesday. The collaboration is part of Baidu's ambitious Apollo Plan, which seeks to devise, build, test and eventually distribute self-driving systems with level 3, 4 and 5 autonomy. So far the company has assembled a coalition of more than 133 automakers and OEMs. Unity's real-time simulation will enable developers to effectively digitize the development phase of these autonomous technologies, which leads to a number of advantages, Tim McDonough, Unity's head of Automotive, explained to Engadget on a recent call.

<p><em>"Scientists say their work offers a proof of principle for using D-Wave’s quantum computers to tackle even tougher chemistry problems. Since at least 1982, when physicist Richard Feynman first proposed the idea of quantum computers, scientists have dreamed of using such exotic machines to simulate quantum phenomena in atoms and molecules. Now, in a paper to be presented in March, scientists at Volkswagen in Munich and San Francisco have used a D-Wave 2000Q quantum computer to solve rudimentary quantum chemistry problems. The results, the VW scientists say, offer a proof of principle of Feynman’s vision using the increasingly popular Canadian quantum computer system. The paper they will present in March, which they shared on the preprint server arXiv, describes running D-Wave computations that find the ground state energies of molecular hydrogen and the molecule lithium hydride. Both molecules are well known and well studied."</em> <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/hardware/vw-tackles-chemistry-problems-with-a-dwave-quantum-computer">[...]</a>

<p><em>"They're almost cute, these little seatless quadbikes, and they can be programmed to autonomously perform a bunch of handy tasks outdoors. Honda has been testing prototypes in search and rescue, firefighting, construction, agriculture, landscaping and snow removal applications, and is looking for partners to come on board to further the technology. The rugged little autonomous work vehicle (AWV) platform is basically a Honda agricultural 4WD quad bike with the top half removed and replaced with a bunch of sensors, self driving equipment and whatever else might be required for the specific task laid out for it. Its rail system lets you mount all sorts of accessories and plug-ins, and its fairly rudimentary autonomous capabilities let you set it to "follow me," "pattern" or "A to B" modes, which make it useful across a fairly broad range of applications. Honda's been testing it with a mower towed behind it, keeping weeds and grass down at a 178-acre (72 ha) solar plant in North Carolina. Meanwhile, in Colorado, the fire department has had them following firefighters around, carrying heavy gear as they work their way through steep and difficult terrain on their way to control forest fires."</em> <a href="https://newatlas.com/honda-3e-d18-autonomous-work-vehicles/57719/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The research has been published in the journal Additive Manufacturing. “The most common form of 3D printing is thermoplastic extrusion,” said Emre Gunduz, assistant research professor of mechanical engineering. “That’s usually good enough for prototypes, but for actual fabrication, you need to use materials with high strength, like ceramics or metal composites. But the precursor for these materials are extremely viscous, and normal 3D printers can’t deposit them, because they can’t be pushed through a small nozzle.” Most proposed solutions to this problem involve changing the composition of the materials themselves. However, Gunduz’ solution is to apply high-amplitude ultrasonic vibrations to the nozzle itself. “We found that by vibrating the nozzle in a very specific way,” said Gunduz, “we can reduce the friction on the nozzle walls, and the material just snakes through.” Gunduz and his team have been able to print items with 100-micron precision, which is better than most consumer-level 3D printers."</em> <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ME/News/3d-printing-extremely-viscous-materials">[...]</a>

The trait, called dynamic strain aging (DSA), occurs in metals at high temperatures subjected to stress. In conventionally processed materials, if DSA is present, the strength of the material fluctuates with applied deformation, resulting in serrated stress-strain curves. Researchers, led by Allison Beese, assistant professor of materials sciences and engineering at Penn State, tested the 3D-printed Inconel 625 versus traditionally processed Inconel 625 using neutron diffraction characterization with mechanical testing at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Data gathered at the microscopic level gave a picture of the grain-level origins of the serrated stress curve, and resulted in a new understanding of the microstructure mechanisms that drive this phenomenon. This research, published in Nature Communications, could pave the way for designing materials without dynamic strain aging."</em> <a href="https://news.psu.edu/story/550529/2018/12/05/research/3d-printing-eliminates-undesirable-trait-conventional-superalloys">[...]</a>

This improved efficiency of recovery, or thermoelectric conversion, of waste heat from a curved heat source, enhancing the module’s mechanical reliability as less mechanical stress is placed on semiconductor chips in the module. The team’s research results were published in Advanced Materials Technologies. It is said that Society 5.0, a super-smart society in which our living space will be networked by various IoT (Internet of Things) technologies, will come in the near future. A thermoelectric generation system to permanently generate power by efficiently recovering waste heat energy emitted in the environment is an effective means to conserve the global environment and save energy, and research for applying this system to energy sources for next-generation IoT devices has gained attention."</em> <a href="https://resou.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/research/2018/20181214_1">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A team of NYU researchers has solved a longstanding puzzle of how to build ultra-sensitive, ultra-small electrochemical sensors with homogenous and predictable properties by discovering how to engineer graphene structure on an atomic level. NYU Researchers Offer Major New Insights for Precise Engineering of Ultra-Small, Ultra-Sensitive Electrochemical Sensors Findings Could Benefit Biochemical Detection, Environmental Monitoring, and Lab-on-a-Chip Applications A team of researchers at the New York University Tandon School of Engineering and NYU’s Center for Neural Science has solved a longstanding puzzle of how to build ultra-sensitive, ultra-small electrochemical sensors with homogenous and predictable properties by discovering how to engineer graphene structure on an atomic level. Finely tuned electrochemical sensors (also referred to as electrodes) that are as small as biological cells are prized for medical diagnostics and environmental monitoring systems. Demand has spurred efforts to develop nanoengineered carbon-based electrodes, which offer unmatched electronic, thermal, and mechanical properties. Yet these efforts have long been stymied by the lack of quantitative principles to guide the precise engineering of the electrode sensitivity to biochemical molecules. Davood Shahrjerdi, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at NYU Tandon, and Roozbeh Kiani, an assistant professor of neural science and psychology at the Center for Neural Science, have revealed the relationship between various structural defects in graphene and the sensitivity of the electrodes made of it."</em> <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2018/december/graphene-s-magic-is-in-the-defects.html">[...]</a>

Our new memristive devices allow us to implement a faithful model of these behaviors in a solid-state system,” said Wei Lu, U-M professor of electrical and computer engineering and senior author of the study in Nature Materials. Memristors are electrical resistors with memory—advanced electronic devices that regulate current based on the history of the voltages applied to them.

<p><em>"New “HAMR-E” robots could enable inspection of complex machines without dismantling them Jet engines can have up to 25,000 individual parts, making regular maintenance a tedious task that can take over a month per engine. Many components are located deep inside the engine and cannot be inspected without taking the machine apart, adding time and costs to maintenance. This problem is not only confined to jet engines, either; many complicated, expensive machines like construction equipment, generators, and scientific instruments require large investments of time and money to inspect and maintain. Researchers at Harvard University’s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering and John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) have created a micro-robot whose electroadhesive foot pads, origami ankle joints, and specially engineered walking gait allow it to climb on vertical and upside-down conductive surfaces, like the inside walls of a commercial jet engine. The work is reported in Science Robotics. “Now that these robots can explore in three dimensions instead of just moving back and forth on a flat surface, there’s a whole new world that they can move around in and engage with,” said first author Sébastien de Rivaz, a former Research Fellow at the Wyss Institute and SEAS who now works at Apple."</em> <a href="https://wyss.harvard.edu/robots-with-sticky-feet-can-climb-up-down-and-all-around/">[...]</a>

Hypersonic vehicles fly through the atmosphere at incredibly high speeds, creating intense friction with the surrounding air as they travel at Mach 5 or above – five times faster than sound travels. Developing structures that can withstand furnace-like temperatures at such high speeds is a technical challenge, especially for leading edges that bear the brunt of the heat. To address this thermal challenge, DARPA recently announced its Materials Architectures and Characterization for Hypersonics (MACH) program. The MACH program seeks to develop and demonstrate new design and material solutions for sharp, shape-stable, cooled leading edges for hypersonic vehicles.

<p><em>"By creating a new multilayer structure with an enhanced magnetoresisitance ratio, researchers in Japan show that it’s possible to increase the sensitivity of magnetic field sensors. Magnetic field sensors can enhance applications that require efficient electric energy management. Improving magnetic field sensors below the picoTesla range could enable a technique to measure brain activity at room temperature with millisecond resolution -- called magnetic encephalography -- without superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) technology, which requires cryogenic temperatures to work. A group of researchers from Japan’s National Institute of Materials Science at the University of Tsukuba and LG Japan Lab Inc. explored enhancing the magnetoresistance ratio in a current-perpendicular-to-plane giant magnetoresistance (CPP-GMR) device by using a half-metallic Heusler CoFeAl0.5Si0.5 (CFAS)alloy. The alloy has 100 percent spin-polarized conduction electrons, which enables very high spin-asymmetry of electron scattering and results in a large magnetoresistance ratio.

<p><em>"Summary: This Arduino based timer can switch one 220V light at dusk, dawn or specified time. Introduction: Some of the lights in my house are automatically switched on at dusk, until either a pre-set time or until dawn (all night). The location of the lights does not allow the use of a light sensor. The regular available clock timers switch on at a specific time. To switch on around dusk therefore requires regularly adjusting the timer program setting. As a nice challenge, I decided to build a custom Arduino based stand alone timer instead."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Duskdawn-Clock-Timer/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Monitoring accurately the temperature in your home is definitely one of the best way to save on your energy bill. At the same time you want to feel well in a warm home during winter time. My current thermostat only allows a static programmation: I can define a day temperature (around 19/20 to not heat too much) and a night (or no one at home) temperature (16)  For each weekday, I can define time range to apply day temperature and time range to apply night temperature)  Additionally, I can manually adjust the temperature that will be taken in account until the next time range is reachedNot so bad but I cannot monitor the temperature remotely: specially when coming from vacation, I am not able to warm the home before we arrive. I cannot stop heating automatically when there is no one at home. I cannot take in account other parameters that impacts home temperature like sunshine during the day (warming home), winds (cooling home)... I cannot have control on temperature set by my wife, overheating all day at 25C  ..."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Connected-Thermostat/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://iosoft.blog/ftdi-python/">Programming FTDI devices in Python</a></h2>

<p><em>"FTDI chips are frequently used as USB-to-serial adaptors, but the newer devices have the ability to drive more complex protocols such as SPI and I2C. I like to use Python when first experimenting with new PC hardware, and there are some Python libraries for interfacing to FTDI chips, but I couldn’t find any real projects or complete worked examples. The following posts demonstrate a step-by-step approach to driving the FTDI chips from Python, to learn about their functionality. In the final part, I implement a pure-Python SWD interface that can access the internals of a CPU while it is running, in a similar way to much more sophisticated debug tools, such as OpenOCD.

<p><em>"This a CHIP-8 game console emulator working on FPGA chip (TinyFPGA BX). Implementation notes and remarks Writing unit tests (see cpu, gpu, bcd) helped me a lot, I was able to test most instructions in simulation. I wrote several simple assembly programs which I compiled to CHIP-8 using the Tortilla-8 project. There was also some manual testing needed in order to get both the screen and the keypad to work. I wrote some simple programs to run on the chip, and corrected some misconceptions I have on CHIP-8 behavior (for instance, memory loads and stores include multiple registers, and sprite drawing wraps around). I was able to correct my Rust CHIP-8 emulator in the process; it's funny how it was able to run many games despite getting these things completely wrong."</em> <a href="https://github.com/pwmarcz/fpga-chip8">[...]</a>
