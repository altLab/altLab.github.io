<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1571, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler">Johannes Kepler</a>. Este astrónomo alemão formulou as três leis principais do movimento planetário que permitiram a Isaac Newton conceber a lei da gravitação. A trabalhar a partir das posições cuidadosamente medidas dos planetas registadas por Tycho Brahe, Kepler deduziu matematicamente três relações a partir dos dados: (1) os planetas movem-se em órbitas elípticas com o Sol num foco; (2) o vetor do raio percorre áreas iguais em tempos iguais; e (3) para dois planetas, os quadrados de seus períodos são proporcionais aos cubos de suas distâncias médias ao sol. Kepler sugeriu que as marés eram causadas pela atração da lua. Ele acreditava que o universo era governado por regras matemáticas, mas reconhecia a importância da verificação experimental.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1654, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Bernoulli">Jacob Bernoulli</a>. Este matemático e astrónomo suíço foi um dos primeiros a utilizar plenamente o cálculo diferencial e introduziu o termo integral no cálculo integral. As primeiras contribuições importantes de Jacob Bernoulli foram um panfleto sobre os paralelos da lógica e da álgebra (1685), o trabalho sobre a probabilidade em 1685 e a geometria em 1687. O seu resultado de geometria deu uma construção para dividir qualquer triângulo em quatro partes iguais com duas linhas perpendiculares. Em 1689, ele publicou importantes trabalhos sobre séries infinitas e publicou sua lei de grandes números na teoria das probabilidades. Ele publicou cinco tratados sobre séries infinitas (1682 - 1704). Jacob ficou intrigado com a espiral logarítmica e pediu que fosse esculpida na sua lápide. Ele foi o primeiro da família de matemáticos Bernoulli e irmão de Johann Bernoulli.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1773, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Cayley">George Cayley</a>. Este pioneiro aeronáutico inglês construiu o primeiro planador bem sucedido de transporte humano (1853). Ele fez extensos estudos anatómicos e funcionais do vôo das aves. Medindo as massas musculares de aves e humanos, ele percebeu que seria impossível para os humanos amarrarem um par de asas e elevarem-se no ar. Os seus estudos posteriores sobre os princípios de sustentação, resistência e impulso fundaram a ciência da aerodinâmica da qual ele descobriu que as aeronaves estabilizadoras exigiam lemes traseiros verticais e horizontais, que as asas côncavas produziam mais sustentação do que superfícies planas e que as asas arrastadas proporcionavam maior estabilidade. Cayley também inventou o trator de lagartas (1825), sinais automáticos de travessia de ferrovias, botes salva-vidas de auto-direcção e um motor de ar de expansão (ar quente).</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1822, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Pasteur">Louis Pasteur</a>. Este Químico francês é considerado o fundador da microbiologia. Ele começou como químico trabalhando nas propriedades ópticas do ácido tartárico e sua estereoquímica (1849). Ele mudou-se para a microbiologia quando descobriu o papel das bactérias na fermentação - que eram microrganismos na levedura causando a formação de álcool a partir do açúcar - e provou que o crescimento de micro-organismos não era gerado espontaneamente a partir de matéria não-viva. Isto levou à compreensão da teoria do germe da infecção e ao seu método de matar bactérias nocivas em líquidos, mantendo-as por um tempo a uma dada temperatura, que agora é conhecida como pasteurização. Ele criou e testou vacinas para difteria, cólera, febre amarela, peste, raiva, antraz e tuberculose.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou foi lançado o Kernel 4.20 do Linux. Linus Torvalds, depois da sua sabática volta aos comandos do Kernel Linux e 350.000 novas linhas de código depois as novidades são muitas. Desde logo a remoçao do controverso algoritmo de cifra Speck da NSA, adicionando e melhorando o suporte a gráficos, CPUs e outros hardwares. Suporte para AMD Picasso e Raven 2 APU, Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, melhorias nos gráficos do Intel Icelake “Gen 11”. Também são introduzidos alguns "fixes" para o problema do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem">ano 2038</a> que é o ano em que o numero de segundos desde 1 Janeiro de 1970 se esgota (e volta a zero) nos sistemas de 32-bits.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como um modelo 3D que poderá ser útil. É apresentado o livro "Teach Yourself Logic 2017: A Study Guide".</p>

<p>Estando a poucos dias do final do ano resta-me desejar a todos em meu nome e em nome do altLab votos de um excelente ano de 2019 com muitos projetos DIY!</p>

<p><em>""Topological materials" are very interesting for technology, but difficult to study. TU Wien (Vienna) and the University of Science and Technology in China are presenting new approaches. Electrons are not just little spheres, bouncing through a material like a rubber ball. The laws of quantum physics tell us that electrons behave like waves. In some materials, these electron waves can take on rather complicated shapes. The so-called "topological materials" produce electron states that can be very interesting for technical applications, but it is extremely difficult to identify these materials and their associated electronic states."</em> <a href="https://www.tuwien.ac.at/en/news/news_detail/article/126435/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Using laser pulses and supercomputing simulations, researchers observe electrons’ motions in real time. In a recent publication in Science, researchers at the University of Paderborn and the Fritz Haber Institute Berlin demonstrated their ability to observe electrons’ movements during a chemical reaction. Researchers have long studied the atomic-scale processes that govern chemical reactions, but were never before able to observe electron motions as they happened. Electrons exist on the smallest scales, being less than one quadrillionth of a meter in diameter and orbiting an atom at femtosecond speeds (one quadrillionth of a second). Experimentalists interested in observing electron behaviour use laser pulses to interact with the electrons. They can calculate the energy and momentum of the electrons by analysing the properties of the electrons kicked out of the probe by the laser light."</em> <a href="http://www.gauss-centre.eu/SharedDocs/Meldungen/GAUSS-CENTRE/EN/2018/news_23_Paderborn_electron_behaviour.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, ETH Zurich, and Argonne National Laboratory, U.S, have described an extended quantum Maxwell’s demon, a device locally violating the second law of thermodynamics in a system located 1-5 meters away from the demon. The device could find applications in quantum computers and microscopic refrigerators cooling down tiny objects with pinpoint accuracy. The research was published Dec. 4 in Physical Review B. The second law says that the entropy — that is, the degree of disorder or randomness — of an isolated system never decreases. “Our demon causes a device called a qubit to transition into a more orderly state,” explained the study’s lead author Andrey Lebedev of MIPT and ETH Zurich. “Importantly, the demon does not alter the qubit’s energy and acts over a distance that is huge for quantum mechanics.” All quantum Maxwell’s demons described or created so far, by the authors or by other researchers, have had a very limited range of action: They sat right next to the object they operated on."</em> <a href="https://mipt.ru/english/news/quantum_maxwell_s_demon_teleports_entropy_out_of_a_qubit">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2018/12/quasicrystal">Chemists create new quasicrystal material from nanoparticle building blocks</a></h2>

<p><em>"Brown University researchers have discovered a new type of quasicrystal, a class of materials whose existence was thought to be impossible until the 1980s. PROVIDENCE, R.I. [Brown University] — The strange class of materials known as quasicrystals has a new member. In a paper published on Thursday, Dec. 20, in Science, researchers from Brown University describe a quasicrystalline superlattice that self-assembles from a single type of nanoparticle building blocks. This is the first definitive observation of a quasicrystalline superlattice formed from a single component, the researchers say. The discovery provides new insight into how these strange crystal-like structures can emerge. “Single-component quasicrystal lattices have been predicted mathematically and in computer simulations, but hadn’t been demonstrated before this,” said Ou Chen, an assistant professor of chemistry at Brown and the paper’s senior author."</em> <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2018/12/quasicrystal">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Biocompatible sensor could be used in diagnostics, therapeutics, human-computer interfaces, and virtual reality Children born prematurely often develop neuromotor and cognitive developmental disabilities. The best way to reduce the impacts of those disabilities is to catch them early through a series of cognitive and motor tests. But accurately measuring and recording the motor functions of small children is tricky. As any parent will tell you, toddlers tend to dislike wearing bulky devices on their hands and have a predilection for ingesting things they shouldn’t.

<p><em>"Grip strength is a useful metric in a surprisingly broad set of health issues. It has been associated with the effectiveness of medication in individuals with Parkinson’s disease, the degree of cognitive function in schizophrenics, the state of an individual’s cardiovascular health, and all-cause mortality in geriatrics. At IBM Research, one of our ongoing challenges is to obtain a better understanding of the effects of diseases on an individual’s overall health, as well as how AI can help clinicians to monitor individuals in their natural environments, and potentially point to indicators and clues into the progression of a patient’s conditions. In new research published in Scientific Reports today, our team details a first-of-a-kind “fingernail sensor” prototype to help monitor human health. The wearable, wireless device continuously measures how a person’s fingernail bends and moves, which is a key indicator of grip strength. The project began as an attempt to capture the medication state of people with Parkinson’s disease."</em> <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2018/12/fingernail-sensors/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scientists have developed a 3D-printed robotic hand which can play simple musical phrases on the piano by just moving its wrist. And while the robot is no virtuoso, it demonstrates just how challenging it is to replicate all the abilities of a human hand, and how much complex movement can still be achieved through design. Smart mechanical design enables us to achieve the maximum range of movement with minimal control costs: we wanted to see just how much movement we could get with mechanics alone Josie Hughes The robot hand, developed by researchers at the University of Cambridge, was made by 3D-printing soft and rigid materials together to replicate of all the bones and ligaments – but not the muscles or tendons – in a human hand. Even though this limited the robot hand’s range of motion compared to a human hand, the researchers found that a surprisingly wide range of movement was still possible by relying on the hand’s mechanical design. Using this ‘passive’ movement – in which the fingers cannot move independently – the robot was able to mimic different styles of piano playing without changing the material or mechanical properties of the hand. The results, reported in the journal Science Robotics, could help inform the design of robots that are capable of more natural movement with minimal energy use."</em> <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/3d-printed-robot-hand-plays-the-piano">[...]</a>

Engineers have succeeded in fabricating topological LC circuits arranged in a honeycomb pattern where electromagnetic (EM) waves can propagate without backscattering even when pathways turn sharply. These circuits may be suitable for use as high-frequency electromagnetic waveguides, which would allow miniaturization and high integration in various electronics devices, such as mobile phones. There has been a surge in searching for materials with topological properties, whose functions are not influenced even if the sample shapes are changed. Topological properties were first discovered in electron systems, and more recently the notion has been developed for light and microwaves, which is expected to be useful for building optical and electromagnetic waveguides immune to backscattering. However, realization of topological properties in light and microwaves normally requires gyromagnetic materials under an external magnetic field, or some complex structures."</em> <a href="https://www.nims.go.jp/eng/news/press/2018/11/201811190.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"ECG Logger is a Wearable Cardiac Monitor for Long-Term Data Acquisition and Analysis. The ECG Logger Project is aimed for providing a very low-cost (~35$) open-source hardware and software for a Rhythmic Holter. The hardware has been made very simple and is based on an Arduino Nano with two companion boards for the SD card and the instrumentation differential amplifier. It helps monitoring arrhythmia syndromes such as bradycardia, tachycardia, extra-systoles or pause. In no case it can be use to replace a professional medical examination. ECG Logger Viewer is the companion software for reading ECG data from the ECG Logger device ECG Logger is an affordable very low-cost (~35$) and simple ECG-Logger Holter offering a complete solution including a pocket-size ECG recorder hardware device with embedded firmware."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/ECG-Logger-a-Wearable-Cardiac-Monitor-for-Long-Ter/">[...]</a>

Binary time is not always easy to be read, so I thought to make even some more complicated. I think that makes it more interesting on the other side, if you also like such things. The time is displayed like an ordinary digital clock, just each number is in a binary code. For example: 21:36:43 = 10 0001:011 0110:100 0011 I had the chosen layout in mind after having created my last binary led clock, but I also noticed that already other people did have this same idea."</em> <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3309263">[...]</a>

They are powered by AVR Tiny48 (256B RAM, 4K FLASH) and have row of PCB pads that provide access to the ISP signals for programming. IMPORTANT: once you reflash your soap dispenser you cannot restore the original firmware. If you want to be able to restore the original firmware, replace the ATTiny48 on the board with a digikey ATTINY48-MURCT-ND IC and install the stock IC back to restore the original functionality.

<p><em>"I recently built a simple 8 key piano using an original NES controller and Arduino UNO board.Unlike conventional Arduino piano projects which require one digital pin for each key / button the NES controller piano used only three digital pins (D5 for nesClock, D6 for nesLatch, D7 for nesDataIn) leaving 5 extra digital pins available for experimentation. The NES Controller sent pulses of 8-bit information to the Arduino UNO and the pulses were interpreted by the Arduino (bit-banging ) to make sounds via the buzzer module - Build the NES Controller piano and download the sketch then open the serial monitor to watch this process in action.The NES controller piano only played eight different notes (C4 to C5) and my kids tired of playing it pretty quickly - I decided to increase the pianos octave range (C1 to C8) by adding an ultrasonic sensor and create a NES Controller piano / Ultrasonic theremin mash-up that can play 50 notes using only 5 digital pins (+1 for piezo buzzer).Im still a learner when it comes to coding and welcome any feedback regarding my sketch.

<h2><a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Sound-Mouse/">Sound Mouse</a></h2>

<p><em>"In 2016, after being inspired by a video of the Scanman Line Follower on YouTube, I started work on a synthesizer device using the Toshiba TCD1304 linear CCD to synthesize audio from spectrogram data (or graphical data interpreted as spectrogram data) using Michel Rouzic's ARSS code (the source of his Photosounder application). This became overly bulky, hardware-wise, and really didn't work as a standalone controller, so I put it on the back burner. Recently I became aware that the sensors made by Agilent for optical computer mice do a lot of processing internally, both being able to provide a bitmap image (very slowly) and average darkness along with the change in X and Y using simple serial requests (much faster) rather than having to deal with a high-speed analog to digital conversion like the Scanman / Toshiba sensor. So, I decided to make a simplified version of the CCD synth using a mouse instead of the scanner. By modifying an Arduino library developed by Conor Peterson for reading pixel data from the Agilent sensor to read movement and average darkness I was able to grab the data fast enough for a simple yet responsive standalone gestural synthesizer The components in this device can be purchased for less than ten dollars and the code is simple enough for almost anyone to modify, making this a quick and inexpensive sound maker for performance or as a prank. Using the software below, the scrollwheel button switches between modes: 1 - pitch based on X-position, 2 - pitch based on camera input, 3 - a mix of the two."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Sound-Mouse/">[...]</a>
