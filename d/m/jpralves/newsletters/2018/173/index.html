<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1842, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_Reynolds">Osborne Reynolds</a>. Este Irlandês nascido em Belfast ficou conhecido pelos seus trabalhos na área da dinâmica dos fluidos e da hidrodinâmica.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1875, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Eccles">William Eccles</a>. Este Físico britânico foi pioneiro no desenvolvimento da comunicação de rádio. Ele foi um dos primeiros proponentes da teoria de Oliver Heaviside de que uma camada superior da atmosfera reflecte as ondas de rádio, possibilitando sua transmissão por longas distâncias. Ele também sugeriu em 1912 que a radiação solar era responsável pelas diferenças na propagação de ondas durante o dia e a noite. Ele experimentou detectores e amplificadores de recepção de rádio, definiu o termo "díodo" e estudou as perturbações atmosféricas da recepção de rádio. Depois da Primeira Guerra Mundial, ele fez muitas contribuições para o desenvolvimento de circuitos electrónicos, incluindo o "flip-flop" Eccles-Jordan patenteado em 1918 e usado em contadores binários (trabalhando com F.W. Jordan).</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1885, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Tizard">Henry Tizard</a>. Este químico Inglês conjuntamente com David Pye, desenvolveu o seu trabalho em combustíveis para aeronaves que acabou de levar ao sistema de classificação de octanas, que expressa as características antidetonantes do combustível. Nos anos 1930-40, ele aconselhou o governo britânico nos aspectos científicos da defesa aérea, particularmente o radar. Ele liderou uma missão de levar cientistas britânicos e canadianos aos EUA para informar representantes oficiais americanos sobre dispositivos em desenvolvimento activo para uso em guerras e para obter o apoio de cientistas americanos. Assim começou uma estreita cooperação de cientistas anglo-americanos em campos como aeronáutica e foguetes. Sua influência provavelmente fez a diferença entre a derrota ou a vitória na Batalha da Grã-Bretanha em 1940.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1923, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_F._Codd">Edgar F. Codd</a>. Este matemático e cientista da computação inglês, enquanto trabalhava para a IBM, inventou o modelo relacional para gestão de bases de dados, a base teórica para bases de dados relacionais e sistemas de gestão de base de dados relacional. Ele fez outras contribuições valiosas para a ciência da computação, mas o modelo relacional, uma teoria geral muito influente da gestão de dados, continua a ser a sua conquista mais mencionada, analisada e celebrada.  Ele também contribuiu com conhecimento na área de autómatos celulares.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1933, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Curl">Robert Curl</a>. Este Químico norte-americano que (com Richard E. Smalley e Sir Harold W. Kroto) descobriu o primeiro fulereno, um aglomerado esférico de átomos de carbono, em 1985. A descoberta abriu um novo ramo da química, e os três homens receberam o Prémio Nobel da Química em 1996 pelo seu trabalho. Em setembro de 1985, Curl encontrou-se com Kroto, da Universidade de Sussex, Eng, e Smalley, um colega de Rice, e, em 11 dias de pesquisa, eles descobriram os fulerenos. Eles anunciaram as suas descobertas ao público na edição de 14 de Novembro de 1985 da revista Nature.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que o maior recife de coral do mundo impresso em 3D encontra-se instalado no Maldives Island Resort. Em todo o mundo, várias iniciativas têm explorado o uso da impressão 3D para ajudar a preservar os recifes de corais delicados e em rápido desaparecimento. Agora, num importante desenvolvimento, o maior recife de coral impresso em 3D do mundo foi submerso na Ilha de Verão das Maldivas, um resort de férias no país do Oceano Índico.</p>

<p>Também esta semana a A Stratolaunch anunciou a sua nova família de veículos de lançamento que entrará em operação regular a partir de 2020. O exclusivo sistema de lançamento aéreo da empresa utilizará a maior aeronave do mundo como plataforma de lançamento móvel, capaz de lançar veículos que transportarão satélites para múltiplas órbitas e inclinações numa única missão. Com esses novos veículos, a Stratolaunch está pronta para tornar o acesso ao espaço conveniente, acessível e rotineiro.</p>

<p>Ainda esta semana foi confirmada a existência de gelo nos pólos da Lua. Nas partes mais escuras e mais frias das suas regiões polares, uma equipa de cientistas observou directamente evidências definitivas de gelo de água na superfície da Lua. Esses depósitos de gelo são distribuídos de forma irregular e podem ser antigos. No pólo sul, a maior parte do gelo está concentrada nas crateras lunares, enquanto o gelo do pólo norte é mais amplamente distribuído. A equipa de cientistas, liderada por Shuai Li da Universidade do Havaí e Brown University e incluindo Richard Elphic do Centro de Pesquisa Ames da NASA em Silicon Valley, usou dados do instrumento Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) da NASA para identificar três assinaturas específicas que definitivamente comprovam há gelo de água na superfície da lua.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como um modelo 3D que poderá ser útil. É apresentada a revista hackspace nº10.</p>

<p><em>"Across the globe, a number of initiatives have been exploring the use of 3D printing to help preserve the delicate and quickly disappearing coral reefs. Now, in an exciting development, the world’s largest 3D printed coral reef has been submerged at Summer Island Maldives, a vacation resort on the Indian Ocean nation. Global warming is having drastic effects on most of the world’s ecosystems, but perhaps none is deteriorating as quickly as the world’s coral reefs. The delicate ecosystems, which are home to varied aquatic species—from algae and invertebrates to fish and sea birds—have suffered from a phenomenon called bleaching, which is when coral polyps reject the algae that live inside their tissues and that is caused by increasing sea temperatures. In a bid to curb the destruction of these rich underwater ecosystems, certain groups have been exploring the potential of 3D printing artificial reefs to encourage the growth of natural coral and sustain the species that depend on it for protection. One of those groups is the Melbourne-based Reef Design Lab, which is now responsible for installing the world’s largest 3D printed coral reef in the Maldives."</em> <a href="https://www.smartechpublishing.com/blog/feedrss/worlds-largest-3d-printed-coral-reef-installed-at-maldives-island-resort/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7218">Ice Confirmed at the Moon's Poles</a></h2>

<p><em>"In the darkest and coldest parts of its polar regions, a team of scientists has directly observed definitive evidence of water ice on the Moon's surface. These ice deposits are patchily distributed and could possibly be ancient. At the southern pole, most of the ice is concentrated at lunar craters, while the northern pole's ice is more widely, but sparsely spread. A team of scientists, led by Shuai Li of the University of Hawaii and Brown University and including Richard Elphic from NASA's Ames Research Center in California's Silicon Valley, used data from NASA's Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) instrument to identify three specific signatures that definitively prove there is water ice at the surface of the Moon. M3, aboard the Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft, launched in 2008 by the Indian Space Research Organization, was uniquely equipped to confirm the presence of solid ice on the Moon. It collected data that not only picked up the reflective properties we'd expect from ice, but was able to directly measure the distinctive way its molecules absorb infrared light, so it can differentiate between liquid water or vapor and solid ice."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7218">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2018/08/17/new-ai-camera-revolutionize-autonomous-vehicles/">Stanford engineers create new AI camera for faster, more efficient image classification</a></h2>

<p><em>"Stanford engineers combine two types of computers to create a faster and less energy-intensive image processor for use in autonomous vehicles, security cameras and medical devices. The image recognition technology that underlies today’s autonomous cars and aerial drones depends on artificial intelligence: the computers essentially teach themselves to recognize objects like a dog, a pedestrian crossing the street or a stopped car. The problem is that the computers running the artificial intelligence algorithms are currently too large and slow for future applications like handheld medical devices. Now, researchers at Stanford University have devised a new type of artificially intelligent camera system that can classify images faster and more energy efficiently, and that could one day be built small enough to be embedded in the devices themselves, something that is not possible today. The work was published Aug. 17 in Nature Scientific Reports. “That autonomous car you just passed has a relatively huge, relatively slow, energy intensive computer in its trunk,” said Gordon Wetzstein, an assistant professor of electrical engineering at Stanford, who led the research."</em> <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2018/08/17/new-ai-camera-revolutionize-autonomous-vehicles/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A Princeton University-led study has revealed an emergent electronic behavior on the surface of bismuth crystals that could lead to insights on the growing area of technology known as “valleytronics.” The term refers to energy valleys that form in crystals and that can trap single electrons. These valleys potentially could be used to store information, greatly enhancing what is capable with modern electronic devices. In the new study, researchers observed that electrons in bismuth prefer to crowd into one valley rather than distributing equally into the six available valleys. This behavior creates a type of electricity called ferroelectricity, which involves the separation of positive and negative charges onto opposite sides of a material. The study was published in the journal Nature Physics. The finding confirms a recent prediction that ferroelectricity arises naturally on the surface of bismuth when electrons collect in a single valley."</em> <a href="https://blogs.princeton.edu/research/2018/08/17/a-valley-so-low-electrons-congregate-in-ways-that-could-be-useful-to-valleytronics/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Novel combination of two encryption techniques protects private data, while keeping neural networks running quickly. A novel encryption method devised by MIT researchers secures data used in online neural networks, without dramatically slowing their runtimes. This approach holds promise for using cloud-based neural networks for medical-image analysis and other applications that use sensitive data. Outsourcing machine learning is a rising trend in industry. Major tech firms have launched cloud platforms that conduct computation-heavy tasks, such as, say, running data through a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification.

<p><em>"Berkeley Lab researchers devise system to monitor contaminant plumes. Groundwater contamination is increasingly recognized as a widespread environmental problem. The most important course of action often involves long-term monitoring. But what is the most cost-effective way to monitor when the contaminant plumes are large, complex, and long-term, or an unexpected event such as a storm could cause sudden changes in contaminant levels that may be missed by periodic sampling? Scientists at the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) and Savannah River National Laboratory have developed a low-cost method for real-time monitoring of pollutants using commonly available sensors.

<h2><a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/187727/physicists-fight-laser-chaos-with-quantum/">Physicists fight laser chaos with quantum chaos to improve laser performance</a></h2>

<p><em>"To tame chaos in powerful semiconductor lasers, which causes instabilities, scientists have introduced another kind of chaos. High-powered semiconductor lasers are used in materials processing, biomedical imaging and industrial research, but the emitted light they produce is affected by instabilities, making it incoherent. The instabilities in the laser are caused by optical filaments; light structures that move randomly and change with time, causing chaos. Removing these instabilities has long been a goal in physics, but previous strategies to reduce filaments have usually involved reducing the power of the laser. This means it can no longer be used for many practical high-power applications, such as in ultrabright 3D laser cinema or as elements in extremely bright laser systems used in fusion reactors. Instead, researchers had to choose between a powerful semiconductor laser with poor output quality and a coherent but much less powerful laser."</em> <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/187727/physicists-fight-laser-chaos-with-quantum/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers from Virginia Tech and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory have developed a novel way to 3D print complex objects of one of the highest-performing materials used in the battery and aerospace industries. Previously, researchers could only print this material, known as graphene, in 2D sheets or basic structures. But Virginia Tech engineers have now collaborated on a project that allows them to 3D print graphene objects at a resolution an order of magnitude greater than ever before printed, which unlocks the ability to theoretically create any size or shape of graphene. Because of its strength - graphene is one of the strongest materials ever tested on Earth - and its high thermal and electricity conductivity, 3D printed graphene objects would be highly coveted in certain industries, including batteries, aerospace, separation, heat management, sensors, and catalysis. Graphene is a single layer of carbon atoms organized in a hexagonal lattice. When graphene sheets are neatly stacked on top of each other and formed into a three-dimensional shape, it becomes graphite, commonly known as the “lead” in pencils."</em> <a href="https://vtnews.vt.edu/articles/2018/08/engineering-3dprinted-graphene.html">[...]</a>

Modern optical data and telecommunication employ phase modulators to increase the amount of data relayed and data rate efficiency, i.e. the speed at which information is relayed. Phase modulators may work by grouping several bits of information into fewer symbols, or packets, reducing the overall size, or spectral width. The smaller the spectral width, the higher the data rate efficiency. However due to a natural trade-off this efficiency is reaching a maximum with silicon based devices, hence a more novel solution is needed to bridge the gap between the increase in demand for data and the efficiency in transmitting it."</em> <a href="https://graphene-flagship.eu/garphene-phase-modulators-hold-the-key-to-faster-mobile-technology">[...]</a>

Quantum theory is a cornerstone of modern physics, explaining the behaviour of isolated particles, like the electrons that orbit atoms. It has shown us that quantum particles have great potential for applications, such as powerful quantum computers with the potential to solve complex problems much more quickly than conventional computers. In recent years, the possibility of using the states of quantum particles to hold information has become a reality in the laboratory. This has led to the development of quantum processors made of just a few quantum bits, ‘qubits’ – particles that store a particular quantum state. Unlike the bits in conventional computers, which can be either zero or one, a qubit can be in a ‘superposition’ of zero and one at the same time."</em> <a href="https://news.st-andrews.ac.uk/archive/scientists-make-leap-in-simulating-quantum-particles/">[...]</a>

MIT researchers have taken a step toward solving a longstanding challenge with wireless communication: direct data transmission between underwater and airborne devices. Today, underwater sensors cannot share data with those on land, as both use different wireless signals that only work in their respective mediums. Radio signals that travel through air die very rapidly in water. Acoustic signals, or sonar, sent by underwater devices mostly reflect off the surface without ever breaking through.

Professor Timothy Ralph from UQ’s Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology said that the use of photons in this way could increase the number and types of tasks that computers can help us with. “Current computers use a binary code – comprising ones and zeroes – to transfer information, but quantum computers have potential for greater power by harnessing the power of qubits,” Professor Ralph said. “Qubits can be one and zero at the same time, or can link in much more complicated ways – a process known as quantum entanglement – allowing us to process enormous amounts of data at once. “The real trick is creating a quantum computing device that is reprogrammable and can be made at low cost.” The experiment, conducted primarily at the University of Bristol, proved that it is possible to fully control two qubits of information within a single integrated silicon chip."</em> <a href="https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2018/08/making-light-work-of-quantum-computing-0">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers who study and manipulate the behavior of materials at the atomic level have discovered a way to make a thin material that enhances the flow of microwave energy. The advance, which could improve telecommunications, sheds new light on structural traits, generally viewed as static and a hindrance, that, when made to be dynamic, are actually key to the material’s special ability. The discovery, reported in the journal Nature, shows how domain walls — the naturally occurring boundaries, separating atoms with different directions of relative displacement, that create dipoles within a material — could actually be an entryway for accessing a much wider range of electromagnetic frequencies. And this access could one day expand the range of frequencies used as communications channels. In the paper, researchers from Drexel University, Bar-Ilan University in Israel, the University of California at Berkeley, the University of California at Santa Barbara, the Carnegie Institution for Science, and the University of Pennsylvania showed how a ferroelectric material can be designed in such a way that domain walls can be used to transmit microwaves with a higher degree of frequency control than the mobile devices we currently use. “As consumer demand for mobile communications increases the available wireless spectrum is increasingly congested and new technologies are needed to create adaptive, frequency-agile antennas,” said Robert York, PhD, a professor at UC Santa Barbara and a co-author of the paper."</em> <a href="http://drexel.edu/now/archive/2018/August/ferroelectric-domain-wall-material/">[...]</a>

In a paper published online today in Science, the team demonstrates a novel device structure that not only gives them unprecedented control over the angular orientation in twisted-layer devices, but also allows them to vary this angle in situ, so that the effects of twist angle on electronic, optical, and mechanical properties can be studied in a single device.

<p><em>"In a lab project at the department of human-centered ubiquitous media we were challenged to create a modern music player which references traditional radio design. The timeframe was one semester. In order to get familiar with the potentiometers, the Arduino platform as well as the displays, we built a small prototype. We connected the potentiometer to the Arduino and wrote a sketch which sends the value of the potentiometer to the Raspberry. On the Raspberry's side, a small python script receives the data and sends it to the e-ink display. As we were still using the red-black version of the e-ink display, updating the display took 15 seconds, which we deemed to slow for our interaction scenario."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/NFC-Timeline-Radio/">[...]</a>
