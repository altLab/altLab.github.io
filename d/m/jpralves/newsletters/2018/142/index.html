<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1799, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Dixon_(inventor)">Joseph Dixon</a>. Este inventor norte-americano foi pioneiro no uso industrial de grafite e muitas outras inovações. Como impressor e fotógrafo, ele projectou um espelho numa câmara que foi o precursor do visor, patenteou uma máquina a vapor de duas manivelas, desenvolveu um método de impressão de notas para falsificadores de papelão. Como fabricante e empresário, Joseph Dixon produziu o primeiro lápis feito nos EUA, 2 de Abril de 1827, e foi responsável pelo desenvolvimento da indústria de grafite.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1813, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Glidden">Joseph Glidden</a>. Este inventor norte-americano, nascido em Charlestown - New Hampshire,  era um fazendeiro de Illinois quando desenvolveu o design do primeiro arame farpado comercial, um produto que transformaria o Ocidente. Antes dessa inovação, os colonos das planícies sem árvores não tinham meios fáceis de cercar os animais longe das terras cultivadas, e os fazendeiros não tinham como evitar que seus rebanhos vagueassem por toda parte. O arame farpado de Glidden abriu as planícies para a agricultura em grande escala e fechou o campo aberto, levando a era do vaqueiro ao fim.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1825, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Frankland">Edward Frankland</a>. Este químico inglês foi um dos primeiros pesquisadores no campo da química estrutural, inventou o vínculo químico e tornou-se conhecido como o pai da valência. Ele estudou compostos organometálicos - moléculas híbridas dos conhecidos elementos orgânicos não metálicos (como carbono, hidrogénio, nitrogénio, enxofre, fósforo) com metais verdadeiros. Em 1850, preparou pequenas moléculas orgânicas contendo metais como o zinco. Posteriormente, ele desenvolveu a teoria da valência (anunciada em 10 de maio de 1852), que cada tipo de átomo possui uma capacidade fixa de combinação com outros átomos.</p>

<p>Nesta data faz igualmente anos que nascia, em 1829, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludvig_Lorenz">Ludvig Lorenz</a>. Este físico e matemático dinamarquês desenvolveu fórmulas matemáticas para descrever fenómenos como a relação entre a refracção da luz e a densidade de uma substância transparente pura e a relação entre a condutividade e temperatura térmica e térmica de um metal (lei Wiedemann-Franz-Lorenz).</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1861, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Goldschmidt">Hans Goldschmidt</a>. Este químico alemão inventou o processo térmite (alumino-termico) que foi adoptado mundialmente para soldar as linhas ferroviários e que ainda está em uso para soldagem no local. A primeira linha soldada desta forma foi colocada em Essen. Este método evoluiu a partir de seu processo de redução Goldschmidt que ele começou a investigar em 1893 para a preparação de metais isentos de carbono. Ele usou as reacções de óxidos de certos metais com alumínio para produzir óxido de alumínio e o metal livre. Foi aplicado para separar cromo, manganês e cobalto dos seus minerais de óxido. Goldschmidt também foi um co-inventor de amálgama de sódio.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1888, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Sopwith">Thomas Sopwith</a>. Este desenhador e fabricante de aeronaves inglês, ficou famoso pela sua empresa pioneira que era famosa pela aeronave militar britânica da Primeira Guerra Mundial. O interesse de Sopwith em automobilismo levou em 1910 a pilotar um mono-plano, com o qual ganhou o Prémio Baron de Forest por voar pelo Canal da Mancha a 18 de Dezembro de 1910. Em Junho de 1912, Sopwith com Fred Sigrist e outros criaram The Sopwith Aviation Company e começou a fabricar o biplano Sopwith Tabloid. Pilotado por Harry Hawker, este avião ganhou o registo de altitude britânico de 4.000 metros no 16 de junho de 1913. Durante a Primeira Guerra Mundial, a empresa fabricou alguns dos melhores aviões aliados, incluindo o lendário Sopwith Camel, o Sopwith Pup e o Sopwith Snipe.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia,em 1933, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Dolby">Ray Dolby</a>. Este físico e engenheiro norte-americano ficou conhecido pela invenção dos sistemas de redução de ruído Dolby. Dolby é famoso por inovações que vão desde as cassetes de alta qualidade que foram usadas nos estéreo dos carro até ao mais recente som surround digital em salas de cinema. Como estudante do ensino médio, ele foi trabalhar a tempo parcial para a Ampex Corporation. Enquanto ainda na faculdade, ele juntou-se à pequena equipa de engenheiros da Ampex dedicados a inventar o primeiro gravador de fita prático do mundo, o Ampex VTR (1956). Em 1965, Dolby fundou sua própria empresa - a Dolby Laboratories. O seu primeiro desenvolvimento foi a redução de ruído do tipo Dolby A, uma compressão e expansão de áudio que reduziu drasticamente o silvo de fundo na gravação de fita profissional sem efeitos colaterais perceptíveis.</p>

<p>Na semana que passou ficámos a saber que a Planetary Resources, empresa de mineração espacial apoiada pelo Google Larry Page e o fundador da Braintree, Bryan Johnson, deu outro passo em sua busca para realmente minerar recursos de asteróides e outros corpos celestes. A empresa lançou com sucesso o seu Arkyd-6 CubeSat, que possui uma tecnologia experimental projectada para detectar recursos hídricos no espaço. A Planetary Resources já está a receber telemetria da nave espacial, e a empresa acredita que a tecnologia experimental é um passo decisivo para que ela desenvolva sua próxima plataforma espacial, o Arkyd-301.</p>

<p>Também esta semana ficámos a saber que a Nintendo vai lançar uma linha de experiências interactivas associadas à sua consola mais recente, a Switch. Esta linha designada por Labo foi projectada para inspirar crianças e aqueles que são crianças de coração. Com base na história de 129 anos da Nintendo, que está enraizada em entretenimento inovador e experiências de jogo, a Nintendo Labo continua a missão da empresa de colocar sorrisos nos rostos das pessoas. Em conjunto com o sistema Nintendo Switch, os kits da Nintendo Labo fornecem as ferramentas e a tecnologia para fazer criações DIY divertidas, jogar jogos com suas criações e DESCOBRIR como a magia da tecnologia Nintendo Switch transforma ideias em realidade.</p>

<p>Por fim, a NASA anunciou que, com dados obtidos pela sonda Cassini é possível assumir que na lua Titã de Saturno os seus mares se encontram, como na Terra, a uma elevação média que chamamos de "nível do mar". Esta é a última descoberta que mostra semelhanças notáveis entre a Terra e o Titã, o único outro mundo que conhecemos no nosso sistema solar que possui líquido estável na sua superfície. No entanto, em Titã, os seus lagos e mares estão cheios de hidrocarbonetos, em vez de água líquida, e o gelo de água coberto por uma camada de material orgânico sólido serve como a rocha que envolve esses lagos e mares.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. São apresentados 5 livros "GNU/Linux Command-Line Tools Summary", "Bash Reference Manual - Reference Documentation for Bash 4.4", "Bash Guide for Beginners", "Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide" e "The AWK Programming Language".</p>

<h2><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/12/larry-page-backed-asteroid-mining-company-launches-cube-sat-with-experimental-water-detection-tech/">Larry Page-backed asteroid mining company launches CubeSat with experimental water detection tech</a></h2>

<p><em>"Planetary Resources, the space mining company backed by Google’s Larry Page and Braintree founder Bryan Johnson, has taken another step in its quest to actually mine resources from asteroids and other planetary bodies. The company successfully launched its Arkyd-6 CubeSat, which is holding an experimental technology designed to detect water resources in space. Planetary Resources is already receiving telemetry from the spacecraft, and the company believes that the experimental technology is a critical stepping-stone for it to develop its next spacecraft platform the Arkyd-301. That technology is what Planetary Resources will use to launch its space resource exploration in earnest the company said. The company’s plans for space mining have been met with skepticism (and some amount of ridicule), with many terrestrial analysts claiming that the company’s costs far outweigh any benefits that could arise from mining asteroids. Indeed, in the company’s earliest days it made money by launching satellites that were used to monitor and collect data on earthly rather than planetary resources."</em> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/12/larry-page-backed-asteroid-mining-company-launches-cube-sat-with-experimental-water-detection-tech/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Saturn’s moon Titan may be nearly a billion miles away from Earth, but a recently published paper based on data from NASA’s Cassini spacecraft reveals a new way this distant world and our own are eerily similar. Just as the surface of oceans on Earth lies at an average elevation that we call “sea level,” Titan’s seas also lie at an average elevation. This is the latest finding that shows remarkable similarities between Earth and Titan, the only other world we know of in our solar system that has stable liquid on its surface. The twist at Titan is that its lakes and seas are filled with hydrocarbons rather than liquid water, and water ice overlain by a layer of solid organic material serves as the bedrock surrounding these lakes and seas. The new paper, led by Alex Hayes at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, finds that Titan’s seas follow a constant elevation relative to Titan’s gravitational pull -- just like Earth’s oceans. Smaller lakes on Titan, it turns out, appear at elevations several hundred feet, or meters, higher than Titan’s sea level."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/cassini-finds-saturn-moon-has-sea-level-like-earth">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers using NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) have found eight sites where thick deposits of ice beneath Mars' surface are exposed in faces of eroding slopes. These eight scarps, with slopes as steep as 55 degrees, reveal new information about the internal layered structure of previously detected underground ice sheets in Mars' middle latitudes. The ice was likely deposited as snow long ago. The deposits are exposed in cross section as relatively pure water ice, capped by a layer one to two yards (or meters) thick of ice-cemented rock and dust. They hold clues about Mars' climate history. They also may make frozen water more accessible than previously thought to future robotic or human exploration missions."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/steep-slopes-on-mars-reveal-structure-of-buried-ice">[...]</a>

By utilizing the ability to detect people, objects, etc. and autonomously reduce speed, stop, and avoid any such obstacles, as well as its attention-grabbing design, the experiment will explore the potential of using the robot to communicate information about items not allowed on board and as an advertising medium. The experiment will quantitatively measure the number of views the robot and stationary digital signage receive to compare and determine which is more visible, and also establish a way to evaluate the value of the signage robot. This undertaking by the Narita Airport Corporation was submitted to and adopted by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry as its project, and the robot's mobility technology (the ability to move around in a large area with many people while recognizing its location) is the fruit of the project undertaken by Panasonic with the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization."</em> <a href="http://news.panasonic.com/global/topics/2018/54270.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A nanostructured gate dielectric may have addressed the most significant obstacle to expanding the use of organic semiconductors for thin-film transistors. The structure, composed of a fluoropolymer layer followed by a nanolaminate made from two metal oxide materials, serves as gate dielectric and simultaneously protects the organic semiconductor – which had previously been vulnerable to damage from the ambient environment – and enables the transistors to operate with unprecedented stability. The new structure gives thin-film transistors stability comparable to those made with inorganic materials, allowing them to operate in ambient conditions – even underwater. Organic thin-film transistors can be made inexpensively at low temperature on a variety of flexible substrates using techniques such as inkjet printing, potentially opening new applications that take advantage of simple, additive fabrication processes. “We have now proven a geometry that yields lifetime performance that for the first time establish that organic circuits can be as stable as devices produced with conventional inorganic technologies,” said Bernard Kippelen, the Joseph M. Pettit professor in Georgia Tech’s School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) and director of Georgia Tech’s Center for Organic Photonics and Electronics (COPE). “This could be the tipping point for organic thin-film transistors, addressing long-standing concerns about the stability of organic-based printable devices.” The research was reported January 12 in the journal Science Advances."</em> <a href="http://www.news.gatech.edu/2018/01/12/nanostructured-gate-dielectric-boosts-stability-organic-thin-film-transistors">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is joining the quest to develop quantum computers, devices that would exploit quantum mechanics to crack problems that overwhelm conventional computers. The initiative comes as Google and other companies race to build a quantum computer that can demonstrate “quantum supremacy” by beating classical computers on a test problem. But reaching that milestone will not mean practical uses are at hand, and the new $40 million DOE effort is intended to spur the development of useful quantum computing algorithms for its work in chemistry, materials science, nuclear physics, and particle physics. “We are looking for algorithms that can advance the science,” says Stephen Binkley, acting director of DOE’s $5.4 billion Office of Science in Washington, D.C., who in a 29 November 2017 open letter urged researchers to submit proposals for such work. The U.S. government already spends about $250 million per year on quantum computing, mostly through the Army Research Office, says Christopher Monroe, a physicist at the University of Maryland in College Park and co-founder of the quantum computing startup IonQ. But the DOE money will go mostly to its national laboratories."</em> <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/01/after-years-avoidance-department-energy-joins-quest-develop-quantum-computers">[...]</a>

NiO is a promising material for spintronic devices, where signals are transmitted not by electrical currents but rather by spin waves, consisting of propagating disturbances in the ordering of magnetic materials, in a domino-like fashion. The interdisciplinary team of researchers, led by Alexander Balandin, distinguished professor of electrical and computer engineering, used ultraviolet Raman spectroscopy to investigate how spin ordering affects the energies of phonons in these materials. Phonons are quanta of vibrations of ions, which constitute the crystal lattice of materials. Phonons can interact with electrons and their spins, leading to energy dissipation. Practical applications of spintronic devices in information processing require accurate knowledge of the strength of the electron spin interaction with phonons."</em> <a href="https://ucrtoday.ucr.edu/50918">[...]</a>

Its tools and techniques have led to rapid improvements in everything from self-driving cars and speech recognition to the digital mastery of an ancient board game. Now, physicists are beginning to use machine learning tools to tackle a different kind of problem, one at the heart of quantum physics. In a paper published recently in Physical Review X, researchers from JQI and the Condensed Matter Theory Center (CMTC) at the University of Maryland showed that certain neural networks—abstract webs that pass information from node to node like neurons in the brain—can succinctly describe wide swathes of quantum systems (link is external). Dongling Deng, a JQI Postdoctoral Fellow who is a member of CMTC and the paper’s first author, says that researchers who use computers to study quantum systems might benefit from the simple descriptions that neural networks provide. “If we want to numerically tackle some quantum problem,” Deng says, “we first need to find an efficient representation.” On paper and, more importantly, on computers, physicists have many ways of representing quantum systems."</em> <a href="http://jqi.umd.edu/news/neural-networks-take-on-quantum-entanglement">[...]</a>

For example, a metamaterial that manipulates electromagnetic waves might bend light in an unusual way to create a cloaking device.

University of Groningen Professor of Photophysics and Optoelectronics Maria Antonietta Loi has now found a material in which these hot electrons retain their high energy levels for much longer. This might make it possible to use more of their energy to obtain a higher voltage. Her results were published on 16 January in Nature Communications. The efficiency of solar panels is hampered by a Goldilocks problem: photons need to have just the right amount of energy to be converted into free electrons, which contribute to the voltage."</em> <a href="https://www.rug.nl/sciencelinx/nieuws/2018/01/20180116_loi_hot">[...]</a>

With advancements in thermoelectric technology, this sustainable solution might one day become a reality. Thermoelectric devices are made from materials that can convert a temperature difference into electricity, without requiring any moving parts — a quality that makes thermoelectrics a potentially appealing source of electricity. The phenomenon is reversible: If electricity is applied to a thermoelectric device, it can produce a temperature difference. Today, thermoelectric devices are used for relatively low-power applications, such as powering small sensors along oil pipelines, backing up batteries on space probes, and cooling minifridges. But scientists are hoping to design more powerful thermoelectric devices that will harvest heat — produced as a byproduct of industrial processes and combustion engines — and turn that otherwise wasted heat into electricity."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2018/topological-materials-turning-heat-electricity-0117">[...]</a>

But reproducing the exceptional mechanical properties and complex microstructures found in nature has been challenging. Now, a team of researchers at the Harvard John A.

This post attempts to put the range of different options you can use with a Cave Pearl data logger into a conceptual framework, with links to examples that illustrate the ideas in text. One thing to note before you start is that many modern sensors will only accept 3.3v inputs, so UNO based projects need to check if the sensor they want to use is 5v tolerant. Most sensors from vendors like Adafruit put regulators on their breakout boards to handle this 3.3v-5v translation, but you may have to place level shifters between some of the more advanced digital sensors and an UNO based logger."</em> <a href="https://thecavepearlproject.org/2017/12/17/adding-sensors-to-an-arduino-data-logger/">[...]</a>

I’ll tell you – software support. A couple weeks ago I decided to invest some time learning this platform because I was sick of paying 20+ dollars for a Teensy. While the PJRC platforms are fantastic, they are expensive and need a proprietary boot loader in order to work. I want a small and powerful arm chip which I can integrate INTO my own PCBs and the Teensy does not easily or cheaply allow this."</em> <a href="http://coytbarringer.com/programming-stm32f103-blue-pill-using-usb-bootloader-platformio/">[...]</a>

Compared to the previous instructable using the ATMega1284 effects unit, this box has the following advantages: (1) It has a mixer which mixes the unprocessed signal with the MCU processed signal - that means that the quality of the signal at the output is much improved. (2) It does 16 bit output processing for the two PWM outputs wheras the previous effects box use 8 bits for some of the examples such as the delay effect. (3) It has a feedback potentiometer which can be used to enhance the effects - especially with the flanger/phaser effect about 30 percent feedback adds considerably to the quality of the effect. (4) The low-pass filter frequency is 10 kHz compared to the 5 kHz of the previous effects box - this means the signal at the output sounds considerably "crispier"."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/ATMega1284-Quad-Opamp-Effects-Box/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A Raspberry Pi clock with outside temperature display using OpenWeatherMap and inside temperature display using a MCP9808 sensor. This project is for a building a digital clock that includes temperature display. It uses OpenWeatherMap to retrieve outside temperature information and a MCP9808 sensor for inside temperature. The assembly is fairly simple and requires the following components: - Raspberry Pi Zero W - Adafruit 1.2" 4-Digit 7-Segment Display w/I2C Backpack - MCP9808 Temperature Sensor Breakout Board"</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/fwrawx/raspberry-pi-clock-with-temperature-b267fe">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Learn how to make your own arbitrary waveform generator using an ATmega328p, a DDS function generator IC, an op-amp, a few passives, and some hard work. Having your own electronics laboratory at home is great—the only downside is that even basic equipment can be costly. Building your own devices is not only easier on your wallet, but it is also a great way to improve your knowledge. Therefore, in this article, I am going to explain how to build your own function generator. What is a function generator? First, a function generator (also called a tone generator) is an electronic device that can output a specific waveform at a set frequency."</em> <a href="https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/projects/how-to-DIY-waveform-generator-analog-devices-ad9833-ATmega328p/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Lock-Using-Sonars-and-LED-Strips-on-Arduino/">Lock Using Sonars And Led Strips On Arduino</a></h2>

<p><em>"For this project I made a box that opens by using sonars, LED strips and 1 servo motor. The main idea behind this is that you use two sonars that both have a "sweet spot". If you hit both these sweet spots the servo moves and opens the lock. The LED's are used to visualize the sweet spots. For this project you will need: 1 Neopixel strip that's 1 meter long with 30 LED's in total 2 HC - SR04 Sonars 1 Neopixel LEDring with 12 neopixels 3 220 OHM resistors 1 arduino UNO A breadboard Wires 1 box"</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Lock-Using-Sonars-and-LED-Strips-on-Arduino/">[...]</a>
