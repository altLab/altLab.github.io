<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1862, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philipp_Lenard">Philipp Lenard</a>. Este físico húngaro-alemão recebeu o Prémio Nobel de Física de 1905 pela sua pesquisa sobre raios catódicos. Ele descobriu que eles poderiam deixar um tubo de raios catódicos, penetrar em finas chapas metálicas e percorrer uma pequena distância no ar, que se tornaria condutor. Em 1902, ele observou que um electrão livre (como num raio catódico) deveria ter pelo menos uma certa energia para ionizar um gás, derrubando um electrão ligado de um átomo. A sua estimativa da energia de ionização necessária para o hidrogénio foi notavelmente precisa. Também em 1902, ele mostrou que o efeito fotoeléctrico produz os mesmos electrões encontrados nos raios catódicos, que os foto-electrões não são apenas desalojados da superfície do metal, mas ejectados com uma certa quantidade de energia.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1868, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sealy_Townsend">John Sealy Townsend</a>. Este físico britânico foi pioneiro no estudo da condução eléctrica em gases. Em 1898 ele fez a primeira medição direta da carga eléctrica da unidade (e). Como pós-graduado, ele era um estudante de pesquisa de J.J. Thomson. Em 1897, Townsend desenvolveu o método drop-drop para medir e, usando nuvens saturadas de gotículas de água carregadas (estendidas pelo método altamente preciso da gota de óleo de Robert Millikan). Ele foi o primeiro a explicar como as descargas eléctricas passam pelos gases (Electricity in Gases, 1915), pelo que o movimento de electrões num campo eléctrico liberta mais electrões por colisão. Estes, por sua vez, colidem libertando ainda mais electrões numa multiplicação de cargas conhecida como uma avalanche.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1877, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Glover_Barkla">Charles Glover Barkla</a>. Este físico inglês recebeu o Prémio Nobel da Física em 1917 pelo seu trabalho na dispersão de raios-X. Esta técnica é aplicada à investigação de estruturas atómicas, estudando como os raios X passam através de um material e são desviados pelos electrões atómicos. Em 1903, ele mostrou que a dispersão dos raios X pelos gases depende do peso molecular do gás. As suas experiências sobre a polarização de raios-x (1904) e a direcção do espalhamento de um feixe de raios-x (1907) mostraram que os raios X são radiação electromagnética como a luz (enquanto, na época, William Henry Bragg afirmava que Os raios X eram partículas.) Barkla descobriu ainda que cada elemento tem seu próprio espectro de raios X característico.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1896, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_S._Mulliken">Robert Sanderson Mulliken</a>. Este químico e físico recebeu o Prémio Nobel de Química de 1966 pelo “trabalho fundamental sobre ligações químicas e estrutura electrónica de moléculas”. Em 1922, ele sugeriu pela primeira vez um método de separação de isótopos por centrifugação por evaporação. Posteriormente, a maior parte de sua carreira de pesquisa foi dedicada à interpretação dos espectros moleculares e com a aplicação da teoria quântica aos estados electrónicos das moléculas. Com Friedrich Hund, ele desenvolveu a teoria molecular-orbital da ligação química, baseada na ideia de que orbitais atómicos de átomos isolados tornam-se orbitais moleculares, estendendo-se por dois ou mais átomos na molécula. Ele também fez importantes contribuições para a teoria e interpretação de espectros moleculares.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que a Microsoft afunda centro de dados no mar, em Orkney para investigar se pode aumentar a eficiência energética. O data center, um cilindro branco contendo computadores, pode ficar no fundo do mar por até cinco anos. Um cabo submarino leva a energia para o data center e leva seus dados para a costa e para a Internet - no entanto se houver avarias nos equipamentos elas não poderão ser reparadas. Orkney foi escolhido porque é um grande centro de pesquisa em energia renovável.</p>

<p>Também esta semana, Linus Torvalds anunciou o lançamento do Linux 4.17. O lançamento vem alguns meses após a primeira release candidate, e na sua mensagem Torvalds também fala sobre a versão 5.0 do kernel do Linux. Tendo dito anteriormente que o kernel Linux v5.0 "seria sem sentido", ele disse que este próximo grande marco numérico virá em torno "no futuro não muito distante". Por enquanto, porém, é a versão 4.17 - ou Merciless Moray.</p>

<p>Ainda esta semana a NASA anunciou ter encontrado material orgânico antigo, metano misterioso em Marte. O rover Curiosity da NASA encontrou novas evidências preservadas em rochas em Marte que sugerem que o planeta poderia ter sustentado a vida antiga, bem como novas evidências na atmosfera marciana que se relacionam com a busca pela vida actual no Planeta Vermelho. Embora não sejam necessariamente evidências da própria vida, essas descobertas são um bom sinal para futuras missões para explorar a superfície e a sub-superfície do planeta. As novas descobertas - moléculas orgânicas "duras" em rochas sedimentares de 3 mil milhões de anos perto da superfície, bem como variações sazonais nos níveis de metano na atmosfera - aparecem na edição de 8 de Junho da revista Science.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como alguns modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44368813">Microsoft sinks data centre off Orkney</a></h2>

<p><em>"Microsoft has sunk a data centre in the sea off Orkney to investigate whether it can boost energy efficiency. The data centre, a white cylinder containing computers, could sit on the sea floor for up to five years. An undersea cable brings the data centre power and takes its data to the shore and the wider internet - but if the computers onboard break, they cannot be repaired. Orkney was chosen because it is a major centre for renewable energy research. The theory is that the cost of cooling the computers will be cut by placing them underwater. "We think we actually get much better cooling underwater than on land," says Ben Cutler, who is in charge of what Microsoft has dubbed Project Natick."</em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44368813">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In his weekly message to the Linux community on Sunday, Linus Torvalds announced the release of Linux 4.17. The release comes a couple of months after the first release candidate, and in his message Torvalds also talks about version 5.0 of the Linux kernel. Having previously said that Linux kernel v5.0 "should be meaningless", he said that this next major numerical milestone will come around "in the not too distance future". For now, though, it's version 4.17 -- or Merciless Moray, if you prefer -- that's of interest. Linux kernel 4.17 is not a major release, and Torvalds announced it without much fanfare. "So this last week was pretty calm, even if the pattern of most of the stuff coming in on a Friday made it feel less so as the weekend approached."</em> <a href="https://betanews.com/2018/06/04/linux-kernel4-17-5-0/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7154">NASA Finds Ancient Organic Material, Mysterious Methane on Mars</a></h2>

<p><em>"NASA's Curiosity rover has found new evidence preserved in rocks on Mars that suggests the planet could have supported ancient life, as well as new evidence in the Martian atmosphere that relates to the search for current life on the Red Planet. While not necessarily evidence of life itself, these findings are a good sign for future missions exploring the planet's surface and subsurface. The new findings -- "tough" organic molecules in 3-billion-year-old sedimentary rocks near the surface, as well as seasonal variations in the levels of methane in the atmosphere -- appear in the June 8 edition of the journal Science. Organic molecules contain carbon and hydrogen, and also may include oxygen, nitrogen and other elements. While commonly associated with life, organic molecules also can be created by non-biological processes and are not necessarily indicators of life. "With these new findings, Mars is telling us to stay the course and keep searching for evidence of life," said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters, in Washington."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7154">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7151">Juno Solves 39-Year Old Mystery of Jupiter Lightning</a></h2>

<p><em>"Ever since NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft flew past Jupiter in March, 1979, scientists have wondered about the origin of Jupiter's lightning. That encounter confirmed the existence of Jovian lightning, which had been theorized for centuries. But when the venerable explorer hurtled by, the data showed that the lightning-associated radio signals didn't match the details of the radio signals produced by lightning here at Earth. In a new paper published in Nature today, scientists from NASA's Juno mission describe the ways in which lightning on Jupiter is actually analogous to Earth's lightning. Although, in some ways, the two types of lightning are polar opposites. "No matter what planet you're on, lightning bolts act like radio transmitters -- sending out radio waves when they flash across a sky," said Shannon Brown of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, a Juno scientist and lead author of the paper."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7151">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.aalto.fi/en/current/news/2018-05-25-002/">Time crystals may hold secret to coherence in quantum computing</a></h2>

<p><em>"New experimental evidence also lays groundwork for new ways of studying time An Aalto University study has provided new evidence that time crystals can physically exist – a claim currently under hot debate. A time crystal is a structure that does not repeat in space, like normal three-dimensional crystals such as snowflakes or diamonds, but in time. In practice this means that crystals constantly undergo spontaneous change, breaking the symmetry of time by achieving a self-sustaining oscillation. The value is in the time crystal’s coherency, a property that allows temporal and spatial consistency, amounting to longevity otherwise not possible. ‘Nature has given us a system that wants to be coherent over time,’ says Senior Scientist Vladimir Eltsov, leader of the ROTA research group at Aalto University. ‘The system spontaneously begins to evolve in time coherently, over long periods of time, even infinitely long,’ he shares."</em> <a href="http://www.aalto.fi/en/current/news/2018-05-25-002/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://newscenter.lbl.gov/2018/05/28/graphene-layered-magnetic-materials-spintronics/">Graphene Layered With Magnetic Materials Could Drive Ultrathin Spintronics</a></h2>

<p><em>"Measurements at Berkeley Lab's Molecular Foundry reveal exotic spin properties that could lead to new form of data storage esearchers working at the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) coupled graphene, a monolayer form of carbon, with thin layers of magnetic materials like cobalt and nickel to produce exotic behavior in electrons that could be useful for next-generation computing applications. The work was performed in collaboration with French scientists including Nobel Laureate Albert Fert, an emeritus professor at Paris-Sud University and scientific director for a research laboratory in France. The team performed key measurements at Berkeley Lab’s Molecular Foundry, a DOE Office of Science User Facility focused on nanoscience research. Fert shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2007 for his work in understanding a magnetic effect in multilayer materials that led to new technology for reading data in hard drives, for example, and gave rise to a new field studying how to exploit and control a fundamental property known as “spin” in electrons to drive a new type of low-energy, high-speed computer memory and logic technology known as spintronics. In this latest work, published online May 28 in the journal Nature Materials, the research team showed how that spin property – analogous to a compass needle that can be tuned to face either north or south – is affected by the interaction of graphene with the magnetic layers. The researchers found that the material’s electronic and magnetic properties create tiny swirling patterns where the layers meet, and this effect gives scientists hope for controlling the direction of these swirls and tapping this effect for a form of spintronics applications known as “spin-orbitronics” in ultrathin materials."</em> <a href="http://newscenter.lbl.gov/2018/05/28/graphene-layered-magnetic-materials-spintronics/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The "Back to the Future" time machine runs on an imaginary flux capacitor but could the movie invention become reality? In the popular movie franchise Back to the Future, an eccentric scientist creates a time machine that runs on a flux capacitor. Now a group of actual physicists from Australia (RMIT University, University of Queensland) and Switzerland (ETH Zurich) have proposed a similar device that can break time-reversal symmetry. While their flux capacitor doesn’t enable time travel, it’s a critical step in future technologies like the quantum computer and could lead to better electronics for mobile phones and wifi. The research, published in Physical Review Letters, proposes a new generation of electronic circulators - devices that control the direction in which microwave signals move. RMIT’s Professor Jared Cole said the device proposed in the research was built from a superconductor, in which electricity can flow without electrical resistance."</em> <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/news/all-news/2018/may/back-to-future-flux-capacitor">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Reducing the wavelength of light could allow it to be absorbed or emitted by a semiconductor, study suggests. A new way of enhancing the interactions between light and matter, developed by researchers at MIT and Israel’s Technion, could someday lead to more efficient solar cells that collect a wider range of light wavelengths, and new kinds of lasers and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) that could have fully tunable color emissions. The fundamental principle behind the new approach is a way to get the momentum of light particles, called photons, to more closely match that of electrons, which is normally many orders of magnitude greater. Because of the huge disparity in momentum, these particles usually interact very weakly; bringing their momenta closer together enables much greater control over their interactions, which could enable new kinds of basic research on these processes as well as a host of new applications, the researchers say. The new findings, based on a theoretical study, are being published today in the journal Nature Photonics in a paper by Yaniv Kurman of Technion (the Israel Institute of Technology, in Haifa); MIT graduate student Nicholas Rivera; MIT postdoc Thomas Christensen; John Joannopoulos, the Francis Wright Davis Professor of Physics at MIT; Marin Soljačić, professor of physics at MIT; Ido Kaminer, a professor of physics at Technion and former MIT postdoc; and Shai Tsesses and Meir Orenstein at Technion.

Led by Drs Andrij Vasylenko, Samuel Marks, Jeremy Sloan and David Quigley from Warwick’s Department of Physics, in collaboration with the Universities of Cambridge and Birmingham, the researchers have found that the most effective thermoelectric materials can be realised by shaping them into the thinnest possible nanowires.

Dr Andrij Vasylenko, from the University of Warwick’s Department of Physics and the paper’s first author, commented: “In contrast to 3-dimensional material, isolated nanowires conduct less heat and more electricity at the same time. These unique properties yield unprecedented efficiency of heat-to-electricity conversion in one-dimensional materials.” The researchers - which included the group of Dr Andrew J.

In a combined theoretical-experimental research, they were able not only to establish a direct dependence between the size of a template and a resulting structure of a nanowire, but also to demonstrate how this technique can be used for regulation of the thermoelectric efficiency of tin telluride formed into nanowires 1-2 atoms in diameter."</em> <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/atomically_thin_nanowires/">[...]</a>

MIT researchers, working with scientists from Brigham and Women’s Hospital, have developed a new way to power and communicate with devices implanted deep within the human body. Such devices could be used to deliver drugs, monitor conditions inside the body, or treat disease by stimulating the brain with electricity or light. The implants are powered by radio frequency waves, which can safely pass through human tissues. In tests in animals, the researchers showed that the waves can power devices located 10 centimeters deep in tissue, from a distance of 1 meter. “Even though these tiny implantable devices have no batteries, we can now communicate with them from a distance outside the body."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2018/wireless-system-power-devices-inside-body-0604">[...]</a>

The NIST result, made possible by continual improvements in the world’s most accurate atomic clocks, yields a record-low, exceedingly small value for a quantity that Einstein predicted to be zero. As described in a Nature Physics paper (link is external) posted online June 4, NIST researchers used the solar system as a laboratory for testing Einstein’s thought experiment involving Earth as a freefalling elevator. Einstein theorized that all objects located in such an elevator would accelerate at the same rate, as if they were in a uniform gravitational field—or no gravity at all. Moreover, he predicted, these objects’ properties relative to each other would remain constant during the elevator’s free-fall. In their experiment, the NIST team regarded Earth as an elevator falling through the Sun’s gravitational field."</em> <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2018/06/nist-atomic-clock-comparison-confirms-key-assumptions-einsteins-elevator">[...]</a>

A critical part of these devices is the barrier between these terminals, which must be separated for electricity to flow. Improvements to that barrier, known as an electrolyte, are needed to make energy storage devices thinner, more efficient, safer, and faster to recharge. Commonly used liquid electrolytes are bulky and prone to shorts, and can present a fire or explosion risk if they’re punctured. Research led by University of Pennsylvania engineers suggests a different way forward: a new and versatile kind of solid polymer electrolyte ( SPE) that has twice the proton conductivity of the current state-of-the-art material. Such SPEs are currently found in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells, but the researchers’ new design could also be adapted to work for the lithium-ion or sodium-ion batteries found in consumer electronics."</em> <a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/paving-way-safer-smaller-batteries-and-fuel-cells">[...]</a>

In the Esaki diode, a type of semiconductor utilizing what is known as the tunnel effect, its magnetoconductance—the current change when an external magnetic field is applied—can be widely tuned, both in sign and magnitude, by the bias voltage, or the direct-current voltage applied for establishing optimal operation.

Individual animals depart at different angles from the herd and then at different angles from their original departure and so on until “the cows come home.” In physics, this movement that starts off on the straight-and-narrow (ballistic) and is correlated and then dissolves into randomness (diffusive), uncorrelated, is called a ballistic-to-diffusive transition.

Of particular interest is the fact that these high-performance lithium-oxygen batteries can be realized without costly catalysts. One remarkable property of lithium-oxygen batteries is that they can accommodate three to five times the energy density of lithium-ion batteries commonly used today."</em> <a href="http://www.kaist.edu/_prog/_board/?mode=V&amp;no=81421&amp;code=ed_news&amp;site_dvs_cd=en&amp;menu_dvs_cd=0601&amp;list_typ=B&amp;skey=&amp;sval=&amp;smonth=&amp;site_dvs=&amp;GotoPage=">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The new Transient Air System Rig (TASR) was designed and built by Dr Aaron Costall and his team from Imperial College London’s Department of Mechanical Engineering. The researchers hope it will help makers of large off-road and freight vehicles reduce the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) they produce. The rig uses fresh air instead of hot exhaust gas, so the 3D printed plastic parts won’t melt under the usually hot conditions found in normal engine test facilities. It also means makers can 3D print only the parts of the engine that need testing, instead of building a whole engine. TASR will be used to design and test engine components for new low emissions heavy off-road and freight vehicles, and the researchers believe it will help to reduce CO2 emissions both in the UK and worldwide. Caroline Brogan caught up with Dr Costall to discuss the new system."</em> <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/186572/experts-build-pulsed-test-3d-printed/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers have demonstrated large-scale fabrication of a new type of transparent conductive electrode film based on nanopatterned silver. Smartphone touch screens and flat panel televisions use transparent electrodes to detect touch and to quickly switch the color of each pixel. Because silver is less brittle and more chemically resistant than materials currently used to make these electrodes, the new films could offer a high-performance and long-lasting option for use with flexible screens and electronics. The silver-based films could also enable flexible solar cells for installation on windows, roofs and even personal devices. In the journal Optical Materials Express, the researchers report fabrication of a transparent conducting thin-film on glass discs 10 centimeters in diameter. Based on theoretical estimations that matched closely with experimental measurements, they calculate that the thin-film electrodes could perform significantly better than those used for existing flexible displays and touch screens."</em> <a href="https://www.osa.org/en-us/about_osa/newsroom/news_releases/2018/transparent_conductive_films_promising_for_dev_(1)/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/IoT-Desktop-Console-Part-11-IoT-Home-Automation/">IoT Desktop Console. Part : 11 IoT, Home Automation</a></h2>

<p><em>"Preamble This article, the 11th in a series on home automation documents how to create and integrate an IoT Desktop Device into an existing home automation system including all the necessary software functionality to enable the successful deployment within a domestic environment. Picture 1 shows the completed IoT desktop device and Picture 2 shows all the component parts used in the prototype which were 'shoe horned' into the finished article. Introduction As mentioned above this Instructable details how to make an IoT Desktop Device whose primary purpose is to present the user with an 'at a glance' summary of temperature and humidity levels published by distributed sensors within an IoT network accompanied by local barometric pressure along with time and date. The design seamlessly hooks into the MQTT/OpenHAB based IoT network detailed in this series on home automation (HA), building on reused code taken from here. Alternatively as the MQTT interface is fully documented throughout it can be simply be adapted to an existing HA system via MQTT publications/subscriptions. At it's heart is an ESP8266-12E which is responsible for MQTT communications and controlling all functionality excepting LCD display back-lighting control and gesture sensing which use an ATTiny85 and ATMega328P respectively."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/IoT-Desktop-Console-Part-11-IoT-Home-Automation/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Some Barely Viable Prototype hardware for a frequency modulated DDS to replace Channel Elements requiring now-unobtainable crystals: The heatsink (surely harvested from a PC, then salvaged from a box o’ goodies) runs about 25 °C above ambient while dropping a 12 V input to 5 V at 180 mA, so it’s good for maybe 2°C/W. It carries a KA278RA05C LDO regulator; you’d probably want something fancier in real life. The AD9851 DDS requires a 5 V supply to run at 180 MHz from the 30 MHz oscillator on its PCB, with the side effect of putting its minimum Logic 1 Voltage threshold at 3.5 V. Because the Teensy 3.6 runs at 3.3 V from its own on-board linear regulator, the DIP 74AHCT125 level shifter between the two boosts the Teensy’s LVCMOS SPI signals to good old TTL. The sticker on the CPU reminds me of the jumper cut between the USB +5 V line and the VIN pin, thus putting the Teensy on the better-regulated local supply for the benefit of its ADC reference:"</em> <a href="https://softsolder.com/2018/06/04/fm-dds-first-light-hardware/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Often when I have an idea for a new project, it will involve some components or circuitry that I have not used before. To be safe, I will sometimes design a smaller "test" board with just that component or circuit to test it out before I design the larger project. This is where the MegaMUX comes from. I wanted to test out the ADG732 multiplexer which is a 32 channel MUX. This means you can connect one output from the MUX, and select 32 other IO to connect to it. In this project I will show you how to connect the MegaMUX to an Arduino, and give you an idea of what you can do with it."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/MegaMUX-32-Channel-Multiplexer-Tutorial/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Nowadays, security systems made using open source hardware is widely used where you can develop your own security application according to your needs and thanks to Arduino platform and its based open source shields, you can now easily make your security systems which involve some security monitoring tools like alarm, laser, motion, distance, and camera. Of course, the last one is the most important and popular tool used almost in every security system as it's the only way to recognize not only the penetration of the security from a stranger but also know exactly who did that by capturing a photo of him. In this tutorial, we are going to use Arduino Bluetooth Camera with the help of an ultrasonic to detect whether a stranger has entered our house and capture a photo of him automatically once he gets into the area of the ultrasonic wave. Lets talk about the idea behind the Security System using Arduino Bluetooth Camera ... Idea: The idea behind the Arduino Bluetooth Camera is to use 1Sheeld board with the Arduino and using the camera shield from the 1Sheeld App and connect the App to the 1Sheeld board via Bluetooth and hence we have an Arduino Bluetooth Camera that's ready to capture photos and store them into phones storage by one line of Arduino code! We will use the ultrasonic sensor with an obstacle in front of it on a certain distance (say 100 cm) and once anything cut the distance and come in front of the ultrasonic sensor within the range of 10 cm or less, this is considered as a penetration to the security system."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Security-System-Using-Arduino-Bluetooth-Camera/">[...]</a>

I'm a big fan of the scanlime-in-progress live streams Micah Elizabeth Scott (Scanlime) does under the watchful eye of Tuco the cat. Micah's streams are often epic, building, hacking and tinkering with everything from reverse engineering firmware to building a Tuco flyer which I find really interesting, sometimes these are adhoc and I found I frequently missed the first few hours until I noticed the email from YouTube (once I remembered to enable notifications). To solve this problem I put the Particle WebHook to use to query the YouTube API, I added a few LEDs on a ThingyStick prototype PCB to indicate the channel being live. I had planned to 3D print a nice lime enclosure but that's still pending, the final indication can be modified, maybe a big LED, or a "Live" sign using a relay, or maybe some nice RGB Neopixels, the choice is yours.
