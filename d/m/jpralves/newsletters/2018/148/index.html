<p>Faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1611, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Pell">John Pell</a>. Este Matemático inglês introduziu o sinal de divisão (obelus, ÷) na Inglaterra. O obelus foi usado pela primeira vez por Johann Rahn (1622-1676) em 1659 na Álgebra de Teutsche. O livro de Rahn foi interpretado em inglês e publicado, com adições feitas por John Pell. Segundo algumas fontes, John Pell foi uma influência chave sobre Rahn e ele pode ser responsável pelo desenvolvimento do símbolo. Ficou igualmente conhecido pela equação de Pell e pelos números de Pell.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1880, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Shoenberg">Isaac Shoenberg</a>. Este Engenheiro electrotécnico britânico de origem russa foi o principal inventor do primeiro sistema de televisão de alta definição, usado pela British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) para a primeira transmissão pública de alta definição do mundo (de Londres, 1936). Ele instalou as primeiras estações de rádio na Rússia antes de se mudar para a Inglaterra em 1914. Foi chefe de um grupo de pesquisa para Indústrias Eléctricas e Musicais (EMI) que desenvolveu (1931-35) um tipo avançado de câmara (o Emitron) e um tubo de raio catódico de vácuo rígido relativamente eficiente para o receptor de televisão. Até 1964, a BBC usou sua proposta técnica padrão - 405 linhas de varredura e 25 imagens por segundo.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1910, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archer_Martin">Archer Martin</a>. Este bioquímico inglês partilhou (com R.L.M. Synge) o Prémio Nobel de Química em 1952 pelo o desenvolvimento de cromatografia de partição de papel usando dois líquidos diferentes movendo-se em ângulos rectos. Esta técnica analítica rápida e económica separa os diferentes componentes de uma mistura, permitindo sua identificação e análise. Como uma nova ferramenta, proporcionou extensos avanços na pesquisa química, médica e biológica. Em 1941, Martin e Synge perceberam que a partição de um soluto entre um gás e um líquido era possível, mas foi no início dos anos 1950 que Martin desenvolveu a técnica de cromatografia gás-líquido com A. T. James.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1928, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Papert">Seymour Papert</a>. Este Cientista informático norte-americano ficou conhecido por ter inventado a linguagem de programação de computador Logo, uma linguagem educacional de programação de computadores para crianças. Estudou sob Piaget, absorvendo suas teorias educacionais. Ele estudou formas de usar a matemática para entender melhor como as crianças aprendem e pensam, e sobre as maneiras pelas quais os computadores podem ajudar na aprendizagem de uma criança. Com Marvin Minsky, ele co-fundou o Laboratório de Inteligência Artificial no MIT.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que um homem de Saskatoon desenvolveu o maior bungalow de campismo impresso em 3D. Randy Janes, de Saskatoon, finalmente tem o bungalow de campismo de seus sonhos. Janes desenvolveu e imprimiu em 3D no que foi avaliado como não apenas o maior bungalow de campismo impresso em 3D, mas também um dos maiores objectos impressos em 3D internos. A impressão levou nove dias e meio com a maior impressora 3D da América do Norte. James e sua equipa de impressão agora têm um protótipo funcional do bungalow. Este tem quatro metros de altura e pesa 272 quilogramas.</p>

<p>Também esta semana ficámos a saber que a Nokia e a Vodafone vão instalar tecnologia 4G na Lua. A primeira rede móvel cósmica apoiará uma aterragem lunar planeada pela empresa de espaço privado PTScientists. Comemorando 50 anos desde os pequenos passos de Neil Armstrong, a empresa com sede em Berlim tem programado lançar o seu Módulo Autónomo de Aterragem e Navegação (ALINA) em 2019 a bordo de um foguete SpaceX Falcon 9. A cápsula, projectada para transportar e aterrar com dois Audi Lunar Quattro rovers, também servirá como uma estação base LTE, permitindo a transferência suave de dados e vídeos de volta à Terra.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como alguns modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis. É apresentada também a revista newelectronics de 27 de Fevereiro.</p>

<p><em>"He’s been planning it for the past two years, but Randy Janes of Saskatoon finally has the camper of his dreams. Janes developed a 3D-printed camper in what has been billed as not only the world’s largest 3D-printed camper, but also one of the largest indoor 3D-printed objects ever. The print took nine-and-a-half days with North America’s biggest 3D printer. James and his printing team now have a functioning prototype of the camper. “It's kind of surreal,” James told CTV Saskatoon. “I had the thought of walking into it when I designed it on my kitchen table and I got it to work.” The camper stands at four metres tall and 272 kilograms."</em> <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/saskatoon-man-develops-largest-3d-printed-camper-1.3817387">[...]</a>

The technology demonstrator, which is the size of a medicine ball and weighs around 5 kg, will be tested on the ISS by Alexander Gerst during the European Space Agency’s Horizons mission between June and October 2018. “In short, CIMON will be the first AI-based mission and flight assistance system,” said Manfred Jaumann, Head of Microgravity Payloads from Airbus. “We are the first company in Europe to carry a free flyer, a kind of flying brain, to the ISS and to develop artificial intelligence for the crew on board the space station.” Pioneering work was also being done in the area of manufacturing, Jaumann continued, with the entire structure of CIMON, which is made up of plastic and metal, created using 3D printing. CIMON is designed to support astronauts in performing routine work, for example by displaying procedures or – thanks to its ‘neural’ AI network and its ability to learn – offering solutions to problems. It uses Watson AI technology from the IBM cloud and, with its face, voice and artificial intelligence, becomes a genuine ‘colleague’ on board."</em> <a href="http://www.airbus.com/newsroom/press-releases/en/2018/02/hello--i-am-cimon-.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"New NRZ optical receiver opens doors for the next-generation green, larger-capacity optical interconnect systems SAN DIEGO — With the increasing popularization of datacenters and other bandwidth hungry interconnect applications, today’s bandwidth growth of short-distance optical networks demands data transmission speeds of more than 100 Gb/s, calling for the development of energy-efficient, multi-channel optical links with fast data transfer rates. Based on complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (COMS) technology — a standard low-cost, high-volume chip manufacturing technique used for most processors and chips today — a group of researchers from IBM Research in Zurich, Switzerland, together with a consortium working under the EU-funded project “ADDAPT,” have demonstrated a novel optical receiver (RX) that can achieve an aggregate bandwidth of 160 Gb/s through four optical fibers. This is not only the fastest data transmission speed to date, but the newly developed optical receiver also features the link power-on/off functionality and can wake-up and achieve phase-lock in eight nanoseconds, the shortest switch time in record. They will present their innovation at OFC 2018, 11-15 March, San Diego, California, USA. According to the researchers, the rapid power-on/off feature will enhance link utilization and greatly reduce energy consumption on a chip or in an optical interconnect system. Unlike many commercial optical transceivers that are always powered on regardless of transmission activity, the power here would only be used when data packets are transmitted through the optical link."</em> <a href="https://www.osa.org/en-us/about_osa/newsroom/news_releases/2018/ibm_reveals_a_novel_energy-saving_optical_receiver/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Inspired by the human eye, researchers at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) have developed an adaptive metalens, that is essentially a flat, electronically controlled artificial eye. The adaptive metalens simultaneously controls for three of the major contributors to blurry images: focus, astigmatism, and image shift. The research is published in Science Advances. “This research combines breakthroughs in artificial muscle technology with metalens technology to create a tunable metalens that can change its focus in real time, just like the human eye,” said Alan She, a graduate student at SEAS and first author of the paper. “We go one step further to build the capability of dynamically correcting for aberrations such as astigmatism and image shift, which the human eye cannot naturally do.” “This demonstrates the feasibility of embedded optical zoom and autofocus for a wide range of applications including cell phone cameras, eyeglasses and virtual and augmented reality hardware,” said Federico Capasso, Robert L. Wallace Professor of Applied Physics and Vinton Hayes Senior Research Fellow in Electrical Engineering at SEAS and senior author of the paper. “It also shows the possibility of future optical microscopes, which operate fully electronically and can correct many aberrations simultaneously.” The Harvard Office of Technology Development has protected the intellectual property relating to this project and is exploring commercialization opportunities."</em> <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2018/02/researchers-combine-metalens-with-artificial-muscle">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers at North Carolina State University have developed a new technique that allows them to print circuits on flexible, stretchable substrates using silver nanowires. The advance makes it possible to integrate the material into a wide array of electronic devices. Silver nanowires have drawn significant interest in recent years for use in many applications, ranging from prosthetic devices to wearable health sensors, due to their flexibility, stretchability and conductive properties. While proof-of-concept experiments have been promising, there have been significant challenges to printing highly integrated circuits using silver nanowires. Silver nanoparticles can be used to print circuits, but the nanoparticles produce circuits that are more brittle and less conductive than silver nanowires. But conventional techniques for printing circuits don’t work well with silver nanowires; the nanowires often clog the printing nozzles."</em> <a href="https://news.ncsu.edu/2018/02/printing-silver-nanowires-2018/">[...]</a>

Existing supercapacitors on the market typically reach 0.3F/cm2 depending upon complex extended surface electrodes. More significantly, the researchers managed to achieve results of 11-20F/cm2 when the polymers were used with specially treated stainless-steel electrodes – the details of which are being kept private pending a patent application."</em> <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2018/february/supercapacitor.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"About This project was intended to prove if it is possible to build a pointing device (mouse) for people with disabilities for under 20 USD, using only components which are widely available as well as a 3D printer. The result is a basic mouth operated mouse which can be connected via USB to nearly every PC. The case allows to mount it on standard tripods using a 1/4 inch screw. Functionality The user moves the cursor by using a mouthpiece which basically works like a joystick. The right mouse button is operated by pushing the mouthpiece towards the case. The left mouse button is emulated by a sensor that recognizes if the user sucks air trough it."</em> <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1090461">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Following blorgggg's project on conductive silicone circuit, I decided to venture on my own experiment with carbon fiber. Turns out, a shape cast out of carbon-fiber-infused plaster can also be used as a variable resistor! With a few copper rod and the a few quick programming, you will be able to use your conductive plaster form as a sensor which, in this particular example, will be used to generate sound. The application of this experimental form goes well beyond making electronic sound itself. I share this project in the hope of expanding the possibility of circuitry. Electronics do not always have to live within a neat and sleek container; they can also be thought of to be within sculptures, materials, forms, and everyday objects--and we will enter this project with the mindset of creating an alternative forms to knobs, inlets, or buttons."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Making-Electronic-Sound-With-Conductive-Plaster/">[...]</a>

I have a tank to harvest the rather infrequent rain we get in Australia - but boy oh boy, when it does rain here, it REALLY rains! My tank stands about 1.5m high and is on a plinth, meaning I need to get out steps to check the water level (or - because I am so lazy, balance precariously on top of an old gas bottle from the BBQ that has now taken up permanent residence as a 'step' beside the tank). I wanted some way to be able to check the water level in the tank, without all the climbing and hanging onto the drainpipe with one hand (while worrying about what spiders might be behind it - you've heard about Australian spiders - right?)... So, with a renewed late in life interest in electronics, and cheap Arduino clones from China on ebay, I decided to have a go at building a 'widget' to do the job for me. Now, my 'dream' widget was to be permanently installed in the tank, use a solar charged power source, with a remote readout in my garage, or maybe a wireless transmitter using Bluetooth that I could check from my phone, or perhaps even an ESP type device hosting an automatically updated webpage, so that I could check the level of water in my tank from anywhere in the world over the internet... but really - why do I need all that?"</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Ultrasonic-Rainwater-Tank-Capacity-Meter/">[...]</a>

As a long time professional Java developer I’m used to write applications that run on servers with lots of resources: RAM, disk space and energy consumption are rarely a limiting factor for the software we write. Developing software for embedded devices is a totally different story: memory both for flash and heap is very limited."</em> <a href="https://thingpulse.com/2018/02/25/esp8266-monitoring-power-consumption/">[...]</a>
