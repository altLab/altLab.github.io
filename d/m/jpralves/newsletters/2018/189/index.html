<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1780, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Wolfgang_D%C3%B6bereiner">Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner</a>. Este Químico alemão foi responsável pela observação (1829) de que quando certas tríades de elementos estavam dispostas em ordem crescente de massa atómica, a massa do membro central era aproximadamente a média das outras duas, e intermediária em propriedades químicas entre os outros dois elementos. As tríades agora são encontradas como membros consecutivos dos grupos da tabela periódica. Por exemplo, o peso atómico do bromo (80.970) foi a média aritmética dos pesos atómicos do cloro (35.470) e do iodo (126.470) e as propriedades dos três elementos variaram de maneira ordenada, do cloro ao bromo e ao iodo. Döbereiner encontrou outras duas "tríades" - cálcio, estrôncio, bário; e enxofre, selénio, telúrio. Ele foi um dos primeiros químicos a oferecer instruções de laboratório em química. Ele estudou química geral, farmacêutica e analítica. Além disso, ele inventou uma lâmpada na qual o hidrogénio se inflamava em contacto com uma esponja de platina (1823). Embora a lâmpada tivesse aplicação limitada, Döbereiner estava interessado em catálise em geral. Ele descobriu a acção catalítica do dióxido de manganês na decomposição do clorato de potássio.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1816, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_von_Siemens">Werner von Siemens</a>. Este engenheiro electrotécnico alemão desempenhou um papel importante na origem da indústria eléctrica moderna. Siemens combinou sua habilidade como inventor de sucesso e empreendedor começando com sua firma, a Siemens &amp; Halske. O seu primeiro trabalho foi na indústria telegráfica, construindo a primeira linha telegráfica importante da Alemanha, depois outras na Europa e na Ásia. A empresa que ele expandiu-se mais amplamente para a tecnologia eléctrica tornou-se a actual empresa multinacional da Siemens. O seu nome de nascimento era Ernst Werner Siemens, até enobrecer como Werner von Siemens.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, 1844, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Henry_Patterson_(NCR_owner)">John Henry Patterson</a>. Este Fabricante norte-americano fundou a NCR (National Cash Register Co.) e ajudou a popularizar a moderna caixa registadora por meio de técnicas de vendas agressivas e inovadoras. Na década de 1870, quando ele e seu irmão Frank estabeleceram um negócio de sucesso vendendo carvão e suprimentos de mineiros, as vendas não registadas eram um problema. Depois de ler uma descrição da caixa registadora projetada por James Ritty e vendida pela National Manufacturing Company em Dayton, John encomendou duas, sem ser vista. Em seis meses eles reduziram sua dívida de US $ 16.000 para US $ 3.000 e os livros mostraram um lucro de US $ 5.000. Essas máquinas modernas tinham resolvido os antigos problemas de desorganização e desonestidade. Patterson ficou tão impressionado que ele comprou a empresa.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1910, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Coulson">Charles Coulson</a>. Este químico teórico britânico foi conhecido pela aplicação da teoria orbital molecular à ligação química, às estruturas electrónicas de moléculas e ao conceito de valência parcial. Ele desenvolveu muitas técnicas matemáticas para resolver problemas químicos e físicos. A sua teoria orbital molecular trata uma molécula como um todo e estende a teoria quântica atómica com estados "permitidos" de electrões associados a dois ou mais núcleos atómicos. Com essa abordagem, ele explicou a estrutura do benzeno e outros sistemas conjugados, e usando o que ele chamou de valência parcial, ele descreveu a ligação em compostos como o diborano. Depois de escrever sobre Waves (1941) e Electricity (1941), o seu livro Valence (1952) foi altamente influente. Ele também escreveu sobre conciliar visões científicas e religiosas, acreditando que a fé religiosa era essencial na busca da ciência.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1923, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Warren_Anderson">Philip Warren Anderson</a>. Este físico norte-americano partilhou (com John H. Van Vleck e Sir Nevill F. Mott) o Prêmio Nobel de Física de 1977 pelas suas pesquisas sobre semicondutores, supercondutividade e magnetismo. Ele fez contribuições para o estudo da física do estado sólido e a pesquisa sobre interacções moleculares foi facilitada pelo seu trabalho na espectroscopia de gases. Ele concebeu um modelo (conhecido como o modelo de Anderson) para descrever o que acontece quando um átomo de impureza está presente em um metal. Ele também investigou magnetismo e supercondutividade, e seu trabalho é de fundamental importância para a moderna electrónica de estado sólido, possibilitando o desenvolvimento de dispositivos de memória e comutação electrónica de baixo custo em computadores.</p>

<p>E nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que o Homem conseguiu colocar um segundo objecto no espaço entre estrelas. Trata-se da Voyager 2 da NASA. A Voyager 2 está agora a pouco mais de 18 biliões de quilómetros da Terra. Os operadores da missão ainda podem comunicar com a Voyager 2 ao entrar nesta nova fase de sua jornada, mas a informação - movendo-se à velocidade da luz - leva cerca de 16,5 horas para viajar da sonda para a Terra. Em comparação, a luz emitida pelo Sol leva cerca de oito minutos para chegar à Terra.</p>

<p>Também esta semana ficámos a saber que história foi feita e um sonho há muito esperado foi realizado em Mojave, CA, com a SpaceShipTwo da Virgin Galactic. Este não é o primeiro voo espacial com humanos a ser lançado a partir de solo americano desde a missão final do Space Shuttle em 2011, mas a primeira vez que um veículo tripulado construído para serviço comercial de passageiros chegou ao espaço.</p>

<p>Ainda esta semana ficámos também a saber que a sonda chinesa Chang'e-4 entrou na orbita da Lua. Se a missão for bem sucedida, esta sonda será a primeira a aterrar e a explorar o chamado "lado negro da Lua". Ela irá percorrer a superfície lunar, examinará a composição da Lua.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como um modelo 3D que poderá ser útil. É apresentada a revista newelectronics de 11 de Dezembro e o livro "Book of Scratch".</p>

<p><em>"For the second time in history, a human-made object has reached the space between the stars. NASA's Voyager 2 probe now has exited the heliosphere - the protective bubble of particles and magnetic fields created by the Sun. Members of NASA's Voyager team will discuss the findings at a news conference at 11 a.m. EST (8 a.m. PST) today at the meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) in Washington. The news conference will stream live on the agency's website. Comparing data from different instruments aboard the trailblazing spacecraft, mission scientists determined the probe crossed the outer edge of the heliosphere on Nov. 5. This boundary, called the heliopause, is where the tenuous, hot solar wind meets the cold, dense interstellar medium."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7301">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/first-space-flight">Richard Branson Welcomes Astronauts Home from Virgin Galactic's Historic First Spaceflight</a></h2>

<p><em>"History has been made and a long-anticipated dream realised in Mojave, CA, today as Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo, VSS Unity, landed from her maiden spaceflight to cheers from Richard Branson and the teams from Virgin Galactic and The Spaceship Company. Not only is this the first human spaceflight to be launched from American soil since the final Space Shuttle mission in 2011, but the very first time that a crewed vehicle built for commercial, passenger service, has reached space. The historic achievement has been recognised by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) who announced today that early next year they will present pilots Mark “Forger” Stucky and Frederick “CJ” Sturckow with FAA Commercial Astronaut Wings at a ceremony in Washington DC. CJ, as a four-time Space Shuttle pilot, will become the only person to have been awarded NASA and FAA wings. Today’s accomplishment has also been recognised by the NASA Flight Opportunities Program, which flew four space science and technology experiments on VSS Unity, making this Virgin Galactic’s first revenue generating flight. The spectacular spaceflight, which was witnessed by a large crowd of staff and their families, as well as special guests and media, saw a 60 second planned rocket motor burn which propelled VSS Unity to almost three times the speed of sound and to an apogee of 51.4 miles."</em> <a href="https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/first-space-flight">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The Far Side A Chinese lander destined for the far side of the Moon — the side that always faces away from the Earth — has now entered lunar orbit, Space News reports. Early Wednesday morning, the spacecraft carrying the Chang’e-4 lander completed its journey from the Earth, which took nearly five days, and settled into an elliptical orbit around the Moon. Lunar Lander If the mission is successful, Chang’e-4 will be the first-ever lander to explore the so-called “dark side of the Moon.” It’ll rove the lunar surface, examine the Moon’s composition, and even dabble in amateur gardening with a small pod that’ll grow seeds and silkworm larvae. To communicate with the Earth, Chang’e-4 will bounce signals off a relay satellite launched earlier this year. Next Step Chinese officials haven’t announced a firm date or location for the craft’s landing, but it’s expected to touch down in early January 2019, probably in the spacious Von Kármán crater. China is already planning Chang’e-5, the mission to come after Chang’e-4."</em> <a href="https://futurism.com/moon-lander-china-lunar-orbit">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Inside Ford’s new Advanced Manufacturing Center, an engineer stands in front of a 3D printing machine churning out brake parts for Ford’s soon-to-be-introduced Shelby Mustang GT500. Across the room, two team members strap on virtual reality headsets to design and simulate production lines, while another is working alongside a collaborative robot, programming a safer way to install a vehicle part. These technologies are no longer simply a Hollywood vision of the future. For Ford, which has been breaking new ground in auto production for more than a century, they are critical tools and technologies to improve the complex and demanding task of building cars and trucks. And this is all happening every day under one roof at the company’s new $45 million Advanced Manufacturing Center in Redford. “More than 100 years ago, Ford created the moving assembly line, forever changing how vehicles would be mass-produced,” said Joe Hinrichs, Ford’s president of Global Operations."</em> <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2018/12/04/ford-new-45-million-advanced-manufacturing-center-redford-michigan.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"It looks like NASA chose the right space rock for its asteroid-sampling mission. The agency's OSIRIS-REx probe, which just arrived at Bennu last week, has already found hydrated minerals on the 1,640-foot-wide (500 meters) near-Earth asteroid, mission team members announced today (Dec. 10). The discovery suggests that liquid water was once plentiful in the interior of Bennu's parent body, which scientists think was a roughly 62-mile-wide (100 kilometers) rock in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. (Bennu is likely a pile of rubble that coalesced after a massive impact shattered that larger object hundreds of millions of years ago.) [OSIRIS-REx: NASA's Asteroid-Sampling Mission in Pictures] OSIRIS-REx's main goal involves helping scientists better understand the solar system's early days and the role that asteroids like Bennu may have played in delivering water and the chemical building blocks of life to Earth. So, the water find is big news for the mission team."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/42690-asteroid-bennu-had-water-nasa-osiris-rex-discovery.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://news.nus.edu.sg/press-releases/nus-engineers-invent-groundbreaking-spin-based-memory-device">NUS engineers invent groundbreaking spin-based memory device</a></h2>

<p><em>"Researchers have discovered that using ferrimagnets can result in dramatically more stable and efficient spin-based memories A team of international researchers led by engineers from the National University of Singapore (NUS) have invented a new magnetic device which is able to manipulate digital information 20 times more efficiently and with 10 times more stability than commercial spintronic digital memories. The novel spintronic memory device employs ferrimagnets and was developed in collaboration with researchers from Toyota Technological Institute, Nagoya, and Korea University, Seoul. This breakthrough has the potential to accelerate the commercial growth of spin-based memory. “Our discovery could provide a new device platform to the spintronic industry, which at present struggles with issues around instability and scalability due to the thin magnetic elements that are used,” said Associate Professor Yang Hyunsoo from the NUS Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, who spearheaded the project. The invention of this novel spintronic memory was first reported in the journal Nature Materials on 3 December 2018. Rising demand for new memory technologies Today, digital information is being generated in unprecedented amounts all over the world, and as such there is an increasing demand for low-cost, low-power, highly-stable, and highly-scalable memory and computing products."</em> <a href="http://news.nus.edu.sg/press-releases/nus-engineers-invent-groundbreaking-spin-based-memory-device">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://news.mit.edu/2018/liquid-silicon-store-renewable-energy-1206">"Sun in a box" would store renewable energy for the grid</a></h2>

<p><em>"Design for system that provides solar- or wind-generated power on demand should be cheaper than other leading options. MIT engineers have come up with a conceptual design for a system to store renewable energy, such as solar and wind power, and deliver that energy back into an electric grid on demand. The system may be designed to power a small city not just when the sun is up or the wind is high, but around the clock. The new design stores heat generated by excess electricity from solar or wind power in large tanks of white-hot molten silicon, and then converts the light from the glowing metal back into electricity when it’s needed. The researchers estimate that such a system would be vastly more affordable than lithium-ion batteries, which have been proposed as a viable, though expensive, method to store renewable energy. They also estimate that the system would cost about half as much as pumped hydroelectric storage — the cheapest form of grid-scale energy storage to date."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2018/liquid-silicon-store-renewable-energy-1206">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A team of materials scientists from Penn State, Cornell and Argonne National Laboratory have, for the first time, visualized the 3D atomic and electron density structure of the most complex perovskite crystal structure system decoded to date. Perovskites are minerals that are of interest as electrical insulators, semiconductors, metals or superconductors, depending on the arrangement of their atoms and electrons. Perovskite crystals have an unusual grouping of oxygen atoms that form an octahedron — an eight-sided polygon. This arrangement of oxygen atoms acts like a cage that can hold a large number of the elemental atoms in the periodic table. Additionally, other atoms can be fixed to the corners of a cube outside of the cage at precise locations to alter the material’s properties, for instance in changing a metal into an insulator, or a non-magnet into a ferromagnet. In their current work, the team grew the very first discovered perovskite crystal, called calcium titanate, on top of a series of other perovskite crystal substrates with similar but slightly different oxygen cages at their surfaces."</em> <a href="https://news.psu.edu/story/550625/2018/12/06/research/3d-imaging-technique-unlocks-properties-perovskite-crystals">[...]</a>

<p><em>"When it comes to recording and modulating neurons in the brain, neuroscientists face two options: noninvasive tools with low spatiotemporal resolution, or implantable tools that are highly invasive and can only record or impact a small percentage of the brain’s neurons. Mehdi Kiani, Dorothy Quiggle Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering at Penn State, is working to change that. Kiani, along with co-investigator Susan Trolier-McKinstry, professor of materials science and engineering and electrical engineering, is developing a minimally invasive technology for recording and modulating neurons that would allow for unprecedented large-scale neural stimulation and recording with high spatial resolution. The short-term applications of this research include being able to more accurately study the brains of animals, such as rodents, who are genetically similar to humans, in order to gain a more precise understanding of the rodents’ brains and, by extension, human brains. “This research will help us understand how the brain functions at a much larger scale with fine spatial resolutions,” Kiani said. “When we better understand how the brain works, then we can innovate better treatments for brain disorders.” If proven safe and effective, this research eventually may be used for deep-brain stimulation, which could treat neurological conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, dystonia, epilepsy, depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder."</em> <a href="https://news.psu.edu/story/549301/2018/11/28/research/penn-state-researchers-developing-new-technology-advance">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Emulating and understanding the human brain is one of the most important challenges for modern technology: on the one hand, the ability to artificially reproduce the processing of brain signals is one of the cornerstones for the development of artificial intelligence, while on the other the understanding of the cognitive processes at the base of the human mind is still far away. And the research published in the prestigious journal Nature Communications by Gianluca Milano and Carlo Ricciardi, PhD student and professor, respectively, of the Applied Science and Technology Department of the Politecnico di Torino, represents a step forward in these directions. In fact, the study entitled “Self-limited single nanowire systems combining all-in-one memristive and neuromorphic functionalities” shows how it is possible to artificially emulate the activity of synapses, i.e. the connections between neurons that regulate the learning processes in our brain, in a single "nanowire" with a diameter thousands of times smaller than that of a hair. It is a crystalline nanowire that takes the "memristor", the electronic device able to artificially reproduce the functions of biological synapses, to a more performing level. Thanks to the use of nanotechnologies, which allow the manipulation of matter at the atomic level, it was for the first time possible to combine into one single device the synaptic functions that were individually emulated through specific devices."</em> <a href="https://poliflash.polito.it/en/research_innovation/nanowire_memristor_a_nanometric_device_to_reproduce_the_synapses_of_the_brain">[...]</a>

<p><em>"o ensure the digital networking of production systems and the optimization of material-specific requirements, we need to measure, analyze and replicate the changes in material properties in a process in which “digital twins” of materials are created. The materials data space developed by Fraunhofer researchers has laid the groundwork for this process. When a finished part rolls off the production line, this is one of the first questions always asked: “Does this component have the properties I want?” Often, even the tiniest of variations in the production environment are enough to alter a part’s material properties – and throw its functionality into question. Manufacturers avoid this by meticulously inspecting samples throughout the production process. Breaking down the samples into their composite parts and measuring them separately is an extremely time-consuming process. “The outcome of the sample testing process branches out into an array of different subsets, each with their own specific measurement results,” explains Dr. Christoph Schweizer, Head of the Assessment of Materials, Lifetime Concepts business unit at the Fraunhofer Institute for Mechanics of Materials IWM in Freiburg."</em> <a href="https://www.fraunhofer.de/en/press/research-news/2018/december/creating-digital-twins-of-materials.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"By studying ultracold atoms trapped in artificial crystals of light, Guillaume Salomon, a postdoc at the Max-Planck-Institute of Quantum Optics and a team of scientists have been able to directly observe a fundamental effect of one-dimensional quantum systems.

The study was conducted this year in the Division led by Immanuel Bloch, a director at the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics and professor at the Ludwig Maximilians University in Munich. The new findings are relevant, for example, in connection to high-temperature superconductors that conduct electricity without loss. “One crucial problem related to high-temperature superconductivity is to understand the interplay between magnetism and doping, from which exotic electronic phases can emerge. However, our knowledge is highly dependent on the dimensionality of the system, and quantum gas experiments can help to bridge the gap between one and two dimensions,” says Guillaume Salomon, who has been involved in research in this field since 2014."</em> <a href="http://www.mpq.mpg.de/5770288/2018-12-12-streched-quantum-magnetism?1544724000">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Just thought how would a "cool" kit look a like, so I get an altoids tin box eat all the thinks inside and put all necassary parts inside. ;) a new project from good old Germany. I got some of those very popular FM radio modules at banggood.com, and was thinking how to use them. I found some nice instructables about the TEA 5767 most of them use a NOKIA LCD Display and some buttons to change the frequency or auto scan...., I try those first to learn how to use the TEA 5767, but I didn't like ithem so much it was to boring for me just copy another work and so I think what else could I build with such an TEA 5767 and an Arduino plus some other parts. I like LED's, to be honest I'm addicted to those LED's. Trust me everything with LED is funny."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/arduino-fm-radio-with-LED-bar-graph/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Overview USB MIDI controllers (such as Launchpad Mini Mk II for example) are common and often quite low in cost. To interface such a controller with a Eurorack synth system, often a host computer and a MIDI to CV interface might be used. The host computer would take USB MIDI data from the MIDI controller, perhaps store and manipulate that data in some way (e.g. a sequence), using a MIDI to CV converter to then control a Eurorack synth system. It would be useful to use USB MIDI controllers with Eurorack synth systems without needing a computer and MIDI to CV interface in between the two.

<p><em>"More and more people are looking into buying indoor plants, especially millennials. However, Roughly 1/3 of all plants purchased die within a few months of being brought home. Although one of the advantages of the indoor plants is they are low maintenance, people are still killing their plants over and over again. Unlike having an animal pet, the plants status and needs are not obvious to the owners and may be neglected. Due to the reason that I always kill my plants, I try to make my own self-watering system for my plants to keep them alive. Also, the box will show you the status your pet plant."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Smart-Planter-Box/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"When our son was about three or four years old we started expecting him to do things in a timely manner. I would say things like "We need to go in ten minutes!" or "Play with that truck for five more minutes, and then give someone else a turn". The problem was (a) he could not read a clock, either digital or analog, and (b) he had no sense of how long a minute is. I realized that he needed a clear way to see what five or ten minutes looks like, and be able to track the time remaining. So, I set out to design and build a visual timer."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/VizTimer-the-Electronic-Hourglass/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In this instructable, we made a battery powered RGB LED cube. It automatically shifts through colours with the help of a built in microcontroler. The bottom half of the cube is laser cut and the top half is 3D printed. The cube has a push button on the front and on the side is a DC barrel for charging. Inside is a battery pack consisting of three li-ion batteries powering the 3W LED module as well as the ATTINY85 and the driver circuit. The purpose of this lamp is primarly decorative, but after the first tests it turned out that the cube actually lit up dark areas pretty well."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/RGB-LED-Cube/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This is an ATtiny85-based digital music box that will play a tune stored in memory in MIDI format. The notes sound like a music box or harpsichord, with a decaying envelope, and there are four channels, so up to four notes can play simultaneously. My demonstration program plays the Bach Fugue in D Minor; here's what it sounds like: midiplayer.mp3. You can easily program it to play any MIDI music-box tune you like, from a site such as Music Box Maniacs, and you could use it as the basis for an electronic greeting card, a musical marriage proposal ring box, an electronic doorbell, or any other music-based project. Introduction This project started when I discovered Music Box Maniacs, a site that provides tunes you can print out as a paper strip for use with a range of mechanical music boxes. The tunes are also downloadable as MIDI files, and I thought it would be fun to write a program to convert the MIDI format to the format of binary numbers needed by my earlier Digital Music Box [Updated] project."</em> <a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2E6L">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Battery powered Aquarium Air Pumps are common and can be easily bought from Local Fish Stores. But the downside to such pumps are that you need to replace the batteries each time they run out, or recharge the batteries with a separate charger. You also need to be there to switch it on in case of a power loss in your house. In this instructable I will show you how to modify such an air pump to recharge and start up automatically in case of a power loss. List of Necessary Parts: - LM2596 Buck (Step-Down) Converter - 1 - 5V Relay - 1 - TP4056 Charging Module with DW-01 Protector - 1 - Copper Dot Board - 1 - 18650 Rechargeable Battery (Li-Ion) - 1 - Terminal Connectors (Optional) - 2 - PCB Spacers (Optional) - 2 - Double-Sided Tape - 1 - Copper Wires - Diodes (1N4007) – 3 - Micro USB Cable - 1 - USB Charger - 1 Battery Powered Air Pump (the main ingredient - doesnt matter which brand or company, as long as it works) - 1 These parts are readily available online and can be found in local electronics stores as well. I would like to give you links to these parts but I myself bought these locally so I would not want to recommend you sellers which I do not have any experience with."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Auto-Start-Rechargeable-Aquarium-Air-Pump/">[...]</a>

As the name suggests, the hexapod has 6 legs but in addition to that, it also has a tail or abdomen, a head, antennas, mandibles and even functional eyes. All of this, makes the hexapod look like an ant, so therefore we can also call it an Arduino Ant Robot. Overview For controlling the robot I made a custom-built Android application. The app has 4 buttons through which we can command the robot to move forward or backwards, as well as turn left or right. Along with these main functions, the robot can also move its head and tail, as well as it can bite, grab and drop things and even attack."</em> <a href="https://howtomechatronics.com/projects/arduino-ant-hexapod-robot/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Introduction The latest iteration of the SparkFun Serial Basic Breakout takes advantage of USB-C and is an easy-to-use USB-to-Serial adapter based on the CH340C IC from WCH. With USB-C you can get up to three times the power delivery over the previous USB generation and has the convenient feature of being reversable. The product works with 5V and 3.3V systems and should auto install on most operating systems without the need for additional drivers. The Serial Basic uses the CH340C IC to quickly and easily convert serial signals to USB. It’s a great lower-cost alternative to the extremely popular FTDI Basic.
