<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1785, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Charles_Athanase_Peltier">Jean-Charles-Athanase Peltier</a>. Este físico francês descobriu o efeito que tem o seu nome - Peltier (1834), que é criado na junção de dois metais dissimilares, uma corrente eléctrica que produzirá calor ou frio, dependendo da direcção do fluxo de corrente. Em 1812, Peltier recebeu uma herança suficiente para se retirar da relojoaria e procurar um interesse diverso em frenologia, anatomia, microscopia e meteorologia. Peltier fez um termóstato termoeléctrico para medir a distribuição da temperatura ao longo de uma série de circuitos termo-pares, dos quais descobriu o efeito Peltier. Lenz conseguiu congelar a água por este método. A sua importância não foi totalmente reconhecida até ao posterior trabalho termodinâmico de Kelvin. O efeito agora é usado em dispositivos para medir unidades de refrigeração de temperatura e sem compressão.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1857, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Hertz">Heinrich Rudolf Hertz</a>. Este físico alemão foi o primeiro a transmitir e receber ondas de rádio. Estudou sob Kirchhoff e Helmholtz em Berlim, e tornou-se professor em Bona, em 1889. O seu principal trabalho foi sobre ondas electromagnéticas (1887). Hertz gerou ondas eléctricas por meio da descarga oscilatória de um condensador através de um "loop" fornecido com uma faísca e depois detectando-os com um tipo de circuito semelhante. O condensador de Hertz era um par de hastes de metal, colocadas de ponta a ponta com um pequeno espaço para uma faísca entre eles. Hertz também foi o primeiro a descobrir o efeito fotoeléctrico. A unidade de frequência - um ciclo por segundo - é nomeada após ele. Infelizmente Hertz faleceu por envenenamento de sangue em 1894 aos 37 anos.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1900, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Kollsman">Paul Kollsman</a>. Este engenheiro germano-americano inventou o primeiro altímetro barométrico preciso do mundo, que se tornou vital para a segurança da aviação. O altímetro barométrico original era um instrumento simples que mostrava altitude ao detectar a pressão barométrica, com uma precisão de 20 pés. Em 24 de Setembro de 1929, o histórico "voo cego" de Jimmy Doolittle provou que o altímetro Kollsman tornou possível a navegação "voando pelos instrumentos". O dispositivo era amplamente conhecido como a "Janela Kollsman" porque incluiu uma janela para marcar uma configuração manual para calibrar a pressão barométrica no nível actual do mar. A invenção desempenhou um papel importante no estabelecimento do serviço aéreo agendado de rotina nos EUA e em todo o mundo.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1902, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Strassmann">Fritz Strassmann</a>. Este químico e físico alemão, com Otto Hahn e Lise Mietner, descobriu a fissão nuclear induzida por neutrões em urânio e, dessa forma, criou o campo de energia atómica usado tanto na bomba atómica para a guerra como nos reactores nucleares para produzir electricidade. As técnicas de química analítica de Strassmann mostraram os elementos mais leves produzidos a partir do bombardeamento de neutrões, que foram o resultado da divisão do átomo de urânio em dois átomos mais leves. Mais cedo na sua carreira, Strassmann desenvolveu a técnica do rubidium-estrôncio de amostras geológicas datadas por rádio.</p>

<p>Na semana que passou, a Yandex passou por um outro marco importante na missão de alcançar um carro sem condutor de nível 5, que começou com o lançamento do protótipo de maio de 2017. O carro autónomo Yandex.Taxi navegou com segurança nas ruas de Moscovo depois de uma recente tempestade de neve gerindo interacções com o tráfego, peões, veículos estacionados e outros perigos rodoviários nas ruas com neve e gelo. A movimentação, que ocorreu durante a precipitação leve e temperaturas de -6 ° C (21 ° F), foi um teste avançado que desafia o veículo com condições climáticas de inverno na via pública.</p>

<p>Também esta semana que passou a Boring Company de Elon Musk conseguiu uma licença para preparação e escavação preliminar de um local na capital Norte-Americana. Isto poderá significar, caso o projecto se concretize que a viagem entre Washington e Nova York demore cerca de 29 minutos usando o Hyperloop. Uma redução que seria muito significativa das actuais 3 horas.</p>

<p>Esta semana que passou ficámos também a saber que o relógio de 10.000 anos está a ser construído com o apoio de Jeff Bezos numa montanha nos EUA. Trata-se de um relógio especial, projectado para ser um símbolo, um ícone para o pensamento de longo prazo. É de escala monumental dentro de uma montanha no oeste do Texas. O pai do Relógio é Danny Hillis. Ele tem pensado e trabalhado no Relógio desde 1989. Ele queria construir um Relógio que marca uma vez por ano, onde a mão do século avança uma vez a cada 100 anos, e o cuco sai no milénio.</p>

<p>Ainda esta semana, no Dubai está a ser construída a primeira villa impressa em 3D que ficará pronta dentro de dois meses. Esta tecnologia será usada para construir moradias num programa de habitação governamental. A impressão em 3D reduzirá os custos de construção e reduzirá os prazos de entrega. Espera-se que a tecnologia perturbe  forma como a indústria da construção funciona.</p>

<p>Por fim, hoje foi lançado com sucesso o foguetão Falcon 9 da SpaceX transportando um satélite de imagem de radar espanhol e dois satélites de demonstração para a constelação de banda larga Starlink de banda larga proposta pela SpaceX. Às 9:17, hora local, o lançamento ocorreu na Base da Força Aérea de Vandenberg na Califórnia e levou os três satélites para a baixa órbita terrestre, colocando o satélite radar PAZ 11 minutos após o levantamento. Elon Musk, fundador e CEO da SpaceX, confirmou a colocação bem sucedida dos satélites de demonstração Starlink, denominados TinTin A e B, via Twitter cerca de 80 minutos após o levantamento.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como alguns modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis. É apresentada também a revista MagPi nº67 de Março.</p>

<p><em>"Last week the Yandex.Taxi driverless car team passed another major milestone on our mission to achieve a level 5 self-driving car, which began with the May 2017 prototype launch. The Yandex.Taxi autonomous car safely navigated the streets of Moscow after a recent snowstorm managing interactions with traffic, pedestrians, parked vehicles and other road hazards on snowy and icy streets. The drive, which occurred during light precipitation and -6 C (21 F) temperatures, was an advanced test challenging the vehicle with winter weather conditions on public roads. Over the last few months the team has been testing prototypes in winter weather conditions on a closed course near Moscow. In December 2017, the team debuted the car on public roads and began collecting data during public street testing to further advance Yandex’s driverless technology. Navigating snow-covered city streets requires significant amounts of data including images of both the snowy roads and street signs."</em> <a href="https://yandex.com/company/blog/self-driving-city/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A 29-minute trip from D.C. to New York may seem too good to be true. And it very well may be. But that isn’t stopping Elon Musk from pushing forward with plans to build a Hyperloop along the eastern corridor. And while it’s a very small, very vague step forward, Musk’s Boring Company has received a permit for preparation and preliminary excavation of a site in the nation’s capital. The exact location is 53 New York Avenue NE, next to a McDonald’s and near the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, according to The Washington Post. In July, Elon Musk tweeted that he had received verbal government approval to build a multi-state underground Hyperloop on the East Coast."</em> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/19/elon-musks-boring-company-gets-preliminary-permit-for-nyc-d-c-hyperloop/">[...]</a>

<p><em>" SpaceX on Feb. 22 launched a Falcon 9 rocket carrying a Spanish-owned radar-imaging satellite and two demonstration satellites for SpaceX’s proposed broadband Starlink broadband constellation. The 9:17 a.m. Eastern launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California carried all three spacecraft to low Earth orbit, deploying the PAZ radar satellite 11 minutes after liftoff. Elon Musk, SpaceX’s founder and CEO, confirmed successful deployment of the Starlink demo satellites, dubbed TinTin A and B, via Twitter about 80 minutes after liftoff. “Tintin A &amp; B will attempt to beam “hello world” in about 22 hours when they pass near LA,” Musk tweeted. The day before launch, Musk said Starlink — a global constellation of 4,500 broadband spacecraft in low-Earth orbit — “will serve [the] least served.” SpaceX did not attempt to land Falcon 9’s previously flown first stage following the mission but did attempt to recover the rocket’s upgraded fairing using a parafoil and ship equipped with a large catcher’s net. The fairing, which enshrouds the satellite on the way to orbit, cost $6 million — money SpaceX would like to save if possible."</em> <a href="http://spacenews.com/spacex-launches-pair-of-its-demo-internet-satellites-with-spanish-radar-satellite/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7062">Long-Lived Mars Rover Opportunity Keeps Finding Surprises</a></h2>

<p><em>"NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity keeps providing surprises about the Red Planet, most recently with observations of possible "rock stripes." The ground texture seen in recent images from the rover resembles a smudged version of very distinctive stone stripes on some mountain slopes on Earth that result from repeated cycles of freezing and thawing of wet soil. But it might also be due to wind, downhill transport, other processes or a combination. Opportunity landed on Mars in January 2004. As it reaches the 5,000th Martian day, or sol, of what was planned as a 90-sol mission, it is investigating a channel called "Perseverance Valley," which descends the inboard slope of the western rim of Endeavour Crater. "Perseverance Valley is a special place, like having a new mission again after all these years," said Opportunity Deputy Principal Investigator Ray Arvidson of Washington University in St. Louis."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7062">[...]</a>

<p><em>"We present the Robotic Modeling Assistant (RoMA), an interactive fabrication system providing a fast, precise, hands-on and in-situ modeling experience with an augmented reality CAD editor and a robotic arm 3D printer. As a designer creates a new model using RoMA AR CAD editor, features are constructed concurrently by a 3D printing robotic arm sharing the same design volume. The partially printed physical model then serves as a tangible reference for the designer as she adds new elements to her design. With RoMA, users can integrate real-world constraints into a design rapidly, allowing them to create well-proportioned tangible artifacts. Users can even directly design on and around an existing object, and extending the artifact by in-situ fabrication. On the hardware end, RoMA consists of an augmented reality headset with its controllers (both indicator and cutter), a rotating platform, and a 6DOF robotic 3D printer."</em> <a href="http://www.huaishu.me/projects/roma.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota) announces that it has developed the world's first*1 neodymium-reduced, heat-resistant magnet. Neodymium magnets are used in various types of motors such as the high-output motors found in electrified vehicles, use of which is expected to increase rapidly in the future. The new magnet uses significantly less neodymium, a rare-earth element*2 ("rare earth"), and can be used in high-temperature conditions. The newly developed magnet uses no terbium (Tb) or dysprosium (Dy), which are rare earths that are also categorized as critical materials*3 necessary for highly heat-resistant neodymium magnets. A portion of the neodymium has been replaced with lanthanum (La) and cerium (Ce), which are low-cost rare earths, reducing the amount of neodymium used in the magnet.

<p><em>"New 'PM1643' is built on latest 512Gb V-NAND to offer the most advanced storage, featuring industry-first 1TB NAND flash package, 40GB of DRAM, new controller and custom software Samsung Electronics, the world leader in advanced memory technology, today announced that it has begun mass producing the industry’s largest capacity Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) solid state drive (SSD) – the PM1643 – for use in next-generation enterprise storage systems. Leveraging Samsung’s latest V-NAND technology with 64-layer, 3-bit 512-gigabit (Gb) chips, the 30.72 terabyte (TB) drive delivers twice the capacity and performance of the previous 15.36TB high-capacity lineup introduced in March 2016. This breakthrough was made possible by combining 32 of the new 1TB NAND flash packages, each comprised of 16 stacked layers of 512Gb V-NAND chips. These super-dense 1TB packages allow for approximately 5,700 5-gigabyte (GB), full HD movie files to be stored within a mere 2.5-inch storage device. In addition to the doubled capacity, performance levels have risen significantly and are nearly twice that of Samsung’s previous generation high-capacity SAS SSD. Based on a 12Gb/s SAS interface, the new PM1643 drive features random read and write speeds of up to 400,000 IOPS and 50,000 IOPS, and sequential read and write speeds of up to 2,100MB/s and 1,700 MB/s, respectively."</em> <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-begins-mass-production-of-industrys-largest-capacity-ssd-30-72tb-for-next-generation-enterprise-systems">[...]</a>

The new STM32WB wireless System-on-Chip (SoC) devices combine a fully-featured Arm® Cortex®-M4-based microcontroller to run the main application as well as an Arm Cortex-M0+ core to offload the main processor and offer real time operation on the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 5 and IEEE 802.15.4 radio. The radio can also run other wireless protocols concurrently, including OpenThread, ZigBee®, or proprietary protocols, giving even more options for connecting devices to the Internet of Things (IoT). Today, only a few manufacturers offer similar dual-processor wireless chips capable of managing the user application and the radio separately for optimum performance, and with such large memory size. Alternatives typically utilize entry-level Arm Cortex-M industry-standard cores, which introduce architecture limitations. Combining the higher-performing Cortex-M4 with a Cortex-M0+ for network processing, the STM32WB leverages ST’s ultra-low-power MCU (microcontroller) technologies to combine superior RF performance for longer battery life."</em> <a href="http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/about/media-center/press-item.html/p4013.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The compound’s promising electroactive properties make it an ideal candidate material for redox flow batteries To power entire communities with clean energy, such as solar and wind power, a reliable backup storage system is needed to provide energy when the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t out. One possibility is to use any excess solar- and wind-based energy to charge solutions of chemicals that can subsequently be stored for use when sunshine and wind are scarce. During these down times, chemical solutions of opposite charge can be pumped across solid electrodes, thus creating an electron exchange that provides power to the electrical grid. The key to this technology, called a redox flow battery, is finding chemicals that can not only “carry” sufficient charge, but also be stored without degrading for long periods, thereby maximizing power generation and minimizing the costs of replenishing the system. Researchers at the University of Rochester and University at Buffalo believe they have found a promising compound that could transform the energy storage landscape. In a paper published in Chemical Science, an open access journal of the Royal Society of Chemistry, the researchers describe modifying a metal-oxide cluster, which has promising electroactive properties, so that it is nearly twice as effective as the unmodified cluster for electrochemical energy storage in a redox flow battery."</em> <a href="http://www.buffalo.edu/news/releases/2018/02/022.html">[...]</a>

The research, recently published in npj Nature Quantum Materials, provides tantalizing new possibilities for attaining superconducting states in iron-based materials. “In the research of quantum materials, it’s long been theorized that there are three types of magnetism associated with superconductivity. One type is very commonly found, another type is very limited and only found in rare situations, and this third type was unknown, until our discovery,” said Paul Canfield, a senior scientist at Ames Laboratory and a Distinguished Professor and the Robert Allen Wright Professor of Physics and Astronomy at Iowa State University. The scientists suspected that the material they studied, the iron arsenide CaKFe4As4 , was such a strong superconductor because there was an associated magnetic ordering hiding nearby.

In this way, surplus electricity generated by, e.g., wind turbines can be transformed into chemically bound energy in the hydrogen molecules and stored as a gas for later use. In the research project “Towards Solid Oxide Electrolysis Plants in 2020”, funded by the Danish transmission system operator energinet.dk, DTU Energy joined forces with the company Haldor Topsoe A/S, DTU Electrical Engineering and Aalborg University to test state-of-the-art cell and stack designs in a “close-to-lifelike” simulation based on very detailed wind data from a wind farm on the Danish island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea. “We always talk about the benefits of electrolysis cells to convert surplus energy from renewable energy sources like wind turbines into gas, and now we did so in a real state-of-the-art stack”, says Ming Chen, senior researcher at DTU Energy. The Bornholm distribution system is part of the Nordic interconnected system and fully integrated in the power market "DK2" and it is connected to the Sweden main grid via a sea cable."</em> <a href="http://www.dtu.dk/english/news/Nyhed?id=674b5086-8852-4570-b2b6-20628bedcf73">[...]</a>

<p><em>"At a few billionths of a meter, a nanopore is too tiny to see and too tiny to image easily. These miniscule cavities, when created in synthetic materials, are incredibly powerful. Nanopores have the capacity to detect single-molecules, study single-reaction events, and be used for applications ranging from DNA sequencing to measuring the transfer of individual electrons. Though the fields of nanopore sensing and nanoscale electrochemistry have advanced during the past 30 years, challenges remain. One of Notre Dame’s research groups is among the earliest to investigate electron transfer reactions inside nanopores, and therefore was invited to share their insights in a perspective paper published in ACS Central Science. Kaiyu Fu, a fourth-year graduate student in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, along with Paul W. Bohn, the Arthur J.

<p><em>"High-power light reveals the existence of superconductivity associated with charge "stripes" in the copper-oxygen planes of a layered material above the temperature at which it begins to transmit electricity without resistance. A team of scientists has detected a hidden state of electronic order in a layered material containing lanthanum, barium, copper, and oxygen (LBCO). When cooled to a certain temperature and with certain concentrations of barium, LBCO is known to conduct electricity without resistance, but now there is evidence that a superconducting state actually occurs above this temperature too. It was just a matter of using the right tool—in this case, high-intensity pulses of infrared light—to be able to see it. Reported in a paper published in the Feb. 2 issue of Science, the team’s finding provides further insight into the decades-long mystery of superconductivity in LBCO and similar compounds containing copper and oxygen layers sandwiched between other elements. These “cuprates” become superconducting at relatively higher temperatures than traditional superconductors, which must be frozen to near absolute zero (minus 459 degrees Fahrenheit) before their electrons can flow through them at 100-percent efficiency."</em> <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=112737">[...]</a>

<p><em>"We observe quantum beats in the nanosecond-scale photoluminescence decay of rubrene single crystals after photoexcitation with short laser pulses in a magnetic field in the range of 0.1 to 0.3 T. The relative amplitude of the quantum beats is of the order of 5%. Their frequency is 1.3 GHz when the magnetic field is oriented parallel to the twofold rotation axis of the rubrene molecules and decreases to 0.6 GHz when the magnetic field is rotated to the crystal's molecular stacking direction. The amplitude of the quantum beats decays alongside the non-oscillatory photoluminescence background, which at low excitation densities has an exponential decay time of 4.0 ± 0.2 ns. We interpret this as the effective lifetime of a multiexciton state that originates from singlet-fission and can undergo geminate recombination back to the singlet state. In larger organic molecules, the first electronic excited state can have a significantly lower energy in a triplet configuration when compared to the photoexcited singlet configuration. As a consequence, a singlet exciton in an organic molecular crystal can efficiently transition to a pair of triplet excitons with a total spin of zero, which can ultimately dissociate into independent, long-lived triplet excitons."</em> <a href="http://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5020652?af=R&amp;">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Experiments with 'molecular anvils' mark an important advance for mechanochemistry, which has the potential to make chemistry greener and more precise. Scientists have turned the smallest possible bits of diamond and other super-hard specks into “molecular anvils” that squeeze and twist molecules until chemical bonds break and atoms exchange electrons. These are the first such chemical reactions triggered by mechanical pressure alone, and researchers say the method offers a new way to do chemistry at the molecular level that is greener, more efficient and much more precise. The research was led by scientists from the Department of Energy’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and Stanford University, who reported their findings in Nature today. “Unlike other mechanical techniques, which basically pull molecules until they break apart, we show that pressure from molecular anvils can both break chemical bonds and trigger another type of reaction where electrons move from one atom to another,” said Hao Yan, a physical science research associate at SIMES, the Stanford Institute for Materials and Energy Sciences, and one of the lead authors of the study. “We can use molecular anvils to trigger changes at a specific point in a molecule while protecting the areas we don’t want to change,” he said, “and this creates a lot of new possibilities.” A reaction that’s mechanically driven has the potential to produce entirely different products from the same starting ingredients than one driven the conventional way by heat, light or electrical current, said study co-author Nicholas Melosh, a SIMES investigator and associate professor at SLAC and Stanford."</em> <a href="https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/news/2018-02-21-first-tiny-diamond-anvils-trigger-chemical-reactions-squeezing.aspx">[...]</a>

Moreover, they are very cheap and may be easily acquired, even on the various online stores (which makes them the ones favored by those who like to experiment).

<p><em>"Goal There are stairs up to where I live and during the winter and at night they can be treacherous. I wanted an easy method to illuminate the stairsimagine your hands are full of grocerieswhile also not having to go back and turn them off. Overview Basically I ran an LED strip down the railing of my stairs. At one end, you walk past an Obstacle Avoidance Sensor (you need to be within &lt;5 inches) which an Arduino Nano listens for and triggers a Relay to turn on the LEDs for 30 seconds. All housed within a coffee container for "decent" weatherproofing. That's it!"</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Motion-Activated-LED-Strip/">[...]</a>
