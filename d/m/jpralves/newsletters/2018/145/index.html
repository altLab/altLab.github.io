<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1700, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Bernoulli">Daniel Bernoulli</a>. Este matemático suíço foi o mais destacado na segunda geração da dinastia familiar Bernoulli de matemáticos. O seu talento era prodigioso, abrangendo áreas como a medicina, biologia, fisiologia, mecânica, física, astronomia e oceanografia. O seu principal trabalho, Hydrodynamica (1734, publ. 1738) sobre a dinâmica dos fluidos fornece fórmulas para a velocidade, duração e quantidade de fluxo de fluido para fora da abertura de um recipiente. O famoso teorema de Bernoulli, baseado na conservação de energia, afirma que a energia mecânica total do fluido em deslocação permanece constante. Este total é composto pela energia associada à pressão do fluido, à energia potencial gravitacional da elevação e à energia cinética do movimento do fluido.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1777, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Courtois">Bernard Courtois</a>. Este químico francês descobriu o iodo. Como filho de um fabricante de salitre de Dijon, ele interessou-se por química e foi aprendiz de farmacêutico. Enquanto estava no serviço militar como farmacêutico, tornou-se o primeiro a isolar a morfina pura do ópio (em 1804). Ele voltou a ajudar no negócio de salitre de seu pai, onde as cinzas de algas marinhas foram lixiviadas para sais de sódio e potássio usando ácido sulfúrico. Em 1811, do licor-mãe, ele observou nuvens ascendentes de vapor roxo que condensavam em superfícies frias como cristais escuros com um brilho metálico. Ele pensou que isso poderia ser um elemento novo, mas não tinha capacidade para confirmar completamente sua suspeição. Isso foi verificado posteriormente por Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac e Humphry Davy.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1795, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedlieb_Ferdinand_Runge">Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge</a>. Este químico alemão foi considerado como o criador da técnica analítica amplamente utilizada da cromatografia em papel. No decorrer da sua pesquisa sobre corantes sintéticos, ele isolou e nomeou vários componentes importantes do óleo de alcatrão de carvão, entre eles ácido carbólico (1934, agora chamado fenol), pirrole, ácido rosólico (aurina) e cianol (anilina). Ele não analisou nenhum desses compostos, no entanto. Em 1850, Runge publicou o primeiro estudo sistemático de cromatografia: círculos concêntricos de diferentes substâncias coloridas difundidas através do papel. Ele também observou a capacidade da belladona para induzir dilatação duradoura da pupila do olho (midríase), e ele desenvolveu um processo para obter açúcar do suco de beterraba. Ele investigou a destilação seca e a composição da matéria.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1828, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Verne">Jules Verne</a>. Verne nasceu no porto de Nantes, onde foi treinado para seguir os passos de seu pai como advogado, mas abandonou a profissão no início da vida para escrever para revistas e para o teatro. Genericamente considerado um grande autor literário na França e na maior parte da Europa, onde teve uma grande influência na vanguarda literária e no surrealismo. Verne foi o segundo autor mais traduzido do mundo desde 1979, classificando-se entre Agatha Christie e William Shakespeare. Ele por vezes é chamado de "Pai da ficção científica", um título que também foi atribuído a H. G. Wells e Hugo Gernsback. Ele é mais conhecido pelos seus livros Viagem ao Centro da Terra (1864), Vinte Mil Léguas Submarinas (1870) e a Volta ao Mundo em 80 dias (1873).</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1834, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitri_Mendeleev">Dmitri Mendeleev</a>. Este químico russo desenvolveu a classificação periódica dos elementos. Na sua versão final da tabela periódica (1871), ele deixou lacunas, afirmando que elas seriam preenchidas por elementos não conhecidos. Ele previu as propriedades de oito elementos que ainda não tinham sido descobertos. Para estes oito elementos, ele usou os prefixos de eka, dvi e tri (sânscrito um, dois, três) na sua nomeação. Mendeleev questionou alguns dos pesos atómicos actualmente aceites (eles poderiam ser medidos apenas com uma precisão relativamente baixa naquela altura), ressalvando que não correspondiam aos sugeridos pela sua Lei Periódica. Ele observou que o telúrio tem um peso atómico maior do que o iodo, mas ele os colocou na ordem certa, prevendo incorrectamente que os pesos atómicos aceites no momento eram culpados. Ele ficou intrigado sobre onde colocar os lantanídeos conhecidos e previu a existência de outra fila na tabela, que eram os actínideos, que eram alguns dos mais pesados da massa atómica. Algumas pessoas desacreditaram Mendeleev por prever que haveria mais elementos, mas foi provado estar correto quando Ga (gálio) e Ge (germanium) foram encontrados em 1875 e 1886, respectivamente, ajustando-se perfeitamente aos dois espaços em falta.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1866, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Gomberg">Moses Gomberg</a>. Este químico norte-americano nascido na Rússia iniciou o estudo dos radicais livres em química quando, em 1900, preparou o primeiro, trifenilmetil. Os radicais livres orgânicos são essenciais para o funcionamento do corpo, além de serem relacionados com o envelhecimento e nas doenças. Além disso, eles desempenham um papel importante na produção de plásticos e outros materiais sintéticos amplamente utilizados. Os radicais livres orgânicos contêm uma forma de carbono com um electrão desemparelhado que permite que o radical reaja com outra molécula. Até Gomberg ter sintetizado o trifenilmetil, pensava-se que os radicais livres contendo carbono não existiam. A descoberta de Gomberg levou a teorias modernas da estrutura e reactividade das moléculas orgânicas e levou ao desenvolvimento de todo um campo de pesquisa.</p>

<p>Por fim faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1906, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_Carlson">Chester Carlson</a>. Este físico norte-americano inventou a xerografia, um processo electrostático de copiar a seco que encontrou aplicações que vão desde a cópia de escritório até a reprodução de livros já fora de impressão. O processo envolve a sensibilização de uma superfície foto-condutora para a luz, dando-lhe uma carga electrostática. Em 1947, ele vendeu os direitos comerciais da sua invenção à Haloid Company, um pequeno fabricante de papel fotográfico (que mais tarde se tornaria na Xerox Corporation).</p>

<p>Na semana que passou ficámos a saber que a SpaceX lançou com sucesso o foguetão Falcon. Na passada terça-feira, o mundo pode testemunhar o lançamento do foguetão mais poderoso em quase meio século. A Space Exploration Technologies, uma empresa privada de vôos espaciais mais conhecida como SpaceX, enviou o seu novo foguetão Falcon Heavy no seu primeiro lançamento de teste. A enorme embarcação utilizou os seus motores Merlin no Centro Espacial Kennedy da NASA em Cabo Canaveral. A curiosidade deste lançamento foi a carga do mesmo que era um Roadster Tesla vermelho.</p>

<p>Também na semana que passou pudemos ver um drone da Ehang a transportar passageiros. Foi na CES 2016 que a Ehang mostrou um protótipo de seu drone de passageiros, o Ehang 184. Ficou na altura um certo cepticismo sobre suas capacidades de voo autónomo, mas a empresa acaba de publicar o primeiro vídeo do veículo em voo com passageiros a bordo. Ehang afirma que realizou mais de 1000 voos de teste ao longo dos anos. No vídeo, a empresa disse que o CEO da Ehang, Huazhi Hu e Wang Dong, o vice-prefeito de Guangzhou, na China, onde os testes foram realizados, são dois dos 40 passageiros que levaram ao céu na nave. O drone totalmente eléctrico pode transportar passageiros até 10 milhas de distância ou até 23 minutos de voo.</p>

<p>Ainda esta semana, a NASA fez testes com um Relógio Atómico para Navegação Espacial Profunda. No espaço profundo, a precisão de tempo é vital para a navegação, mas muitas naves espaciais não possuem relógios precisos a bordo. Durante 20 anos, o Laboratório de Propulsão a Jacto da NASA em Pasadena, Califórnia, tem aperfeiçoado um relógio com essa capacidade.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou, a Mozilla apresentou o seu projecto "Project Things" - uma estrutura aberta para conectar seus dispositivos à web. O lançamento torna mais fácil para qualquer pessoa com um Raspberry Pi construir seu próprio Gateway IoT. Além dos comandos e controles baseados na web, um novo recurso experimental mostra o poder e a facilidade de usar comandos baseados em voz.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. É apresentado também um livro sobre aprender com Python - como pensar como um cientista da computação.</p>

<p><em>"On Tuesday, the world may witness a rocket launch more powerful than any that's been seen in nearly half a century. Space Exploration Technologies, a private spaceflight company better known as SpaceX, is sending its new Falcon Heavy rocket on its first test launch. The enormous vessel will ignite its formidable Merlin engines on Tuesday (Feb. 6) at 1:30 p.m. EST (1830 GMT) at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. You can watch the launch live here on Space.com, courtesy of SpaceX, beginning at 1:10 p.m. EST (1810 GMT). The launch window stretches from 1:30 to 4 p.m. EDT (1830 to 2100 GMT). Falcon Heavy's first test flight will include a payload — an electric car that SpaceX will attempt to launch past Mars' orbit."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/39603-spacex-falcon-heavy-rocket-by-the-numbers.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"It was way back at CES 2016 when Ehang showed off a prototype of its passenger drone, the Ehang 184. There was an air of skepticism over its claims of autonomous flying, but the company has just released the first footage of the vehicle in flight with passengers on board. Ehang claims it has carried out more than 1000 test flight over the years. In the video, the company said Ehang CEO Huazhi Hu and Wang Dong, the deputy mayor of Guangzhou, China, where the tests took place, are two of the 40 passengers to have taken to the skies in the craft. The all-electric drone can carry passengers 10 miles or for up to 23 minutes of flight. The company says all someone has to do is input the destination and the aircraft will take them there—flying autonomously—and land."</em> <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/73135-watch-ehang-drone-carrying-passengers-new-flight-video.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In deep space, accurate timekeeping is vital to navigation, but many spacecraft lack precise timepieces on board. For 20 years, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, has been perfecting a clock. It's not a wristwatch; not something you could buy at a store. It's the Deep Space Atomic Clock (DSAC), an instrument perfect for deep space exploration. Currently, most missions rely on ground-based antennas paired with atomic clocks for navigation. Ground antennas send narrowly focused signals to spacecraft, which, in turn, return the signal."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7053">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7052">New Clues to Compositions of TRAPPIST-1 Planets</a></h2>

<p><em>"The seven Earth-size planets of TRAPPIST-1 are all mostly made of rock, with some having the potential to hold more water than Earth, according to a new study published in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics. The planets' densities, now known much more precisely than before, suggest that some planets could have up to 5 percent of their mass in water -- which is 250 times more than the oceans on Earth. The form that water would take on TRAPPIST-1 planets would depend on the amount of heat they receive from their star, which is a mere 9 percent as massive as our Sun. Planets closest to the star are more likely to host water in the form of atmospheric vapor, while those farther away may have water frozen on their surfaces as ice. TRAPPIST-1e is the rockiest planet of them all, but still is believed to have the potential to host some liquid water. "We now know more about TRAPPIST-1 than any other planetary system apart from our own," said Sean Carey, manager of the Spitzer Science Center at Caltech/IPAC in Pasadena, California, and co-author of the new study."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7052">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Intel today introduced the new Intel® Xeon® D-2100 processor, a system-on-chip (SoC) processor architected to address the needs of edge applications and other data center or network applications constrained by space and power. The Intel Xeon D-2100 processor extends the record-breaking performance and innovation of the Intel Xeon Scalable platform from the heart of the data center to the network edge and web tier, where network operators and cloud service providers face the need to continuously grow performance and capacity without increasing power consumption. “To seize 5G and new cloud and network opportunities, service providers need to optimize their data center and edge infrastructures to meet the growing demands of bandwidth-hungry end users and their smart and connected devices,” said Sandra Rivera, senior vice president and general manager of the Network Platforms Group at Intel. “The Intel Xeon D-2100 processor allows service providers and enterprises to deliver the maximum amount of compute intelligence at the edge or web tier while expending the least power.” Intel Xeon D-2100 processors will enable greater performance and hardware-enhanced security to the network edge in support of the growing number of workloads that demand more compute, analytics and data protection closer to endpoint devices. For example, the new processors will help communications service providers CoSPs offer multi-access edge computing (MEC), which allows software applications to tap into local content and real-time information about local-access network conditions, reducing mobile core network of network congestion. This can enable uses cases ranging from 5G-connected cars, smart stadiums, and retail and medical solutions."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news/intel-xeon-d-2100-extends-intelligence-edge-enabling-new-capabilities-cloud-network-service-providers/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Because of their high precision and speed, Delta robots are deployed in many industrial processes, including pick-and-place assemblies, machining, welding, and food packaging. Starting with the first version Reymond Clavel developed for a chocolate factory to quickly place chocolate pralines in their packages, Delta robots use three individually controlled and lightweight arms that guide a platform to move fast and accurately in three directions. The platform is either used as a stage, similar to the ones used in flight simulators, or coupled to a manipulating device that can, for example, grasp, move, and release objects in prescribed patterns. Over time, roboticists have designed smaller and smaller Delta robots for tasks in limited workspaces, yet shrinking them further to the millimeter scale with conventional manufacturing techniques and components has proven fruitless. Reported in Science Robotics, a new design, the milliDelta robot, developed by Robert Wood’s team at Harvard’s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering and John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), overcomes this miniaturization challenge. By integrating their microfabrication technique with high-performance composite materials that can incorporate flexural joints and bending actuators, the milliDelta can operate with high speed, force, and micrometer precision, which together make it compatible with a range of micromanipulation tasks in manufacturing and medicine."</em> <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/01/millidelta-robot-combines-micrometer-precision-with-speed/">[...]</a>

The elastic electrode constructed of breathable nanoscale meshes holds promise for the development of noninvasive e-skin devices that can monitor a person's health continuously over a long period. Wearable electronics that monitor heart rate and other vital health signals have made headway in recent years, with next-generation gadgets employing lightweight, highly elastic materials attached directly onto the skin for more sensitive, precise measurements. However, although the ultrathin films and rubber sheets used in these devices adhere and conform well to the skin, their lack of breathability is deemed unsafe for long-term use: dermatological tests show the fine, stretchable materials prevent sweating and block airflow around the skin, causing irritation and inflammation, which ultimately could lead to lasting physiological and psychological effects.

But in the world of Industrie 4.0 and production with batch sizes of one, you can simply scan the armrest and print it out. This is made possible by the first ever 3D scanner capable of working autonomously and in real time. The autonomous scanning system will be on display at the Hannover Messe Preview on February 6 and at the Hannover Messe proper from April 23 to 27, 2018 (Hall 6, Booth A30). Part of the charm of vintage cars is that they stopped making them long ago, so it is special when you do see one out on the roads."</em> <a href="https://www.fraunhofer.de/en/press/research-news/2018/February/Autonomous-3D-scanner-supports-individual-manufacturing-processes.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Harvard’s Ambulatory MicroRobot is speedy, resilient and versatile If you’ve ever tried to kill an interloping cockroach, you’ve probably noticed two things: they’re fast and nearly invincible. While those features make roaches terrifying to most people, it’s a source of bioinspiration for roboticists at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS). Led by Robert J. Wood, Charles River Professor of Engineering and Applied Sciences at SEAS, researchers in the Harvard Microrobotics Laboratory have developed a centimeter-scale robot inspired by cockroaches. The Harvard Ambulatory Microrobot — nicknamed HAMR — is a versatile robot that can run at high speeds, jump, climb, turn sharply, carry payloads and fall from great distances without being injured. “The HAMR platform evolved from our exploration of millimeter-scale fabrication and actuation strategies,” said Wood, who is also a Core Faculty Member of the Harvard Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering."</em> <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2018/02/cockroach-inspired-robot">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Picture yourself trying to build a machine to detect email spam. You might start with simple rules that identify key words such as “drugs,” for instance. Of course, some legitimate emails could contain those key words, so you add rules to take into account these cases. In an adaptive world, advertisers may quickly learn the rules of your system and develop ways to fool your spam detector. Painstakingly identifying patterns and continuously updating your system by hand is a daunting challenge — even more so for tasks such as identifying one human face out of more than 7 billion, or driving a car through chaotic Manhattan traffic. But what if you could set an environment and ground rules for machines to teach themselves and constantly improve their performance as more data rolls in?"</em> <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/news/teaching-machines-to-learn">[...]</a>

Tests lack common standards and should have been done in real-world conditions and in groups of several cells. Perovskite and dye-sensitized solar cells have been suggested as energy efficient and cost-effective challengers to silicon solar cells currently on the market. So far, the development of challenger cells has focused mainly on studying and improving their efficiency. In order for the cells to become commercially viable, however, the cells need to have a sufficient life-span, not only be efficient.

<p><em>"Data transmission studies in the terahertz region show promise to expand the spectrum available for use. The world is running out of bandwidth to support our growing communication demands. This is in part due to “internet of things” technologies which make everything from your toaster to your front door accessible online, and have driven an explosion in data traffic. A new range of frequencies in the terahertz (THz) region of the spectrum may soon be available for use. A paper appearing this week in APL Photonics, from AIP Publishing, demonstrates the feasibility of using THz carrier waves for data transmission in diverse situations and environments, including non-line-of-sight applications where waves bounce off, or are reflected by, walls and other objects. Daniel Mittleman of Brown University, whose group led the study, said, “We’re not the first group to study the feasibility of THz wireless links, either indoors or outdoors, but there have been few comprehensive studies.” Many researchers in the field have believed that links that rely on indirect, or non-line-of-sight pathways, are impossible."</em> <a href="https://publishing.aip.org/publishing/journal-highlights/advances-open-new-frequency-range-wireless-communications">[...]</a>

<p><em>"With Global Game Jam 2018 coming up soon, I had the idea of building an alternative video game controller for which I could design a game for during the jam. I recently got my hands on an Adafruit Bluefruit LE m0 Featherboard, an Arduino-compatible microcontroller with built-in low-energy bluetooth module and I was quite keen to try and find a project to test it out on. I started thinking of types of control mechanisms that you don't really find on modern, conventional game controllers: I didn't really have too much time to try and use something really exotic that I'd have to order in, so I ended up thinking about paddles. Old games controllers dating back to the 1970's commonly used a single paddle, or rotational knob, for example on the Magnavox Odyssey and the Atari 2600. The original arcade version of Pong, one of the first video games used two potentiometer knob controllers for two player controller of in-game "paddles" (hence the origin of the term, in relation to the on-screen object the players control). No modern game controllers seem to use paddles or knobs anymore."</em> <a href="http://randomprojectlab.blogspot.pt/2018/01/turny-alternative-bluetooth-video-game.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Hi Today Instructable is very simple and easy to build ASTABLE Multivibrator CircuitA Complete Step By Step Video Tutorial is also given in the video below. Astable Multivibrator mode of 555 timer IC is also called Free running or self-triggering mode. Unlike Monostable Multivibrator mode it doesnt have any stable state, it has two quasi stable state (HIGH and LOW). No external triggering is required in Astable mode, it automatically interchange its two states on a particular interval, hence generates a rectangular waveform. This time duration of HIGH and LOW output has been determined by the external resistors (R1 and R2) and a capacitor(C1). Astable mode works as a oscillator circuit, in which output oscillate at a particular frequency and generate pulses in rectangular wave form."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Astable-Multivibrator-Using-555-Timer-DIY-Step-by-/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This article describes how you can use an Arduino sketch running on one Arduino to control and debug another Arduino, or an AVR-Series micro-controller such as an ATTiny85. With some limitations, you can use the controlling Arduino to disassemble code, single step code, inspect and modify the current value of registers. I/O ports and SRAM and run code with a hardware breakpoint set. And, all you need to do this is the RESET pin on the target device, a >10K resistor pulling RESET to Vcc, and a standard, ATMega328-based Arduino to act as the controlling debugger. Because using another Arduino as the target device requires some changes to the target Arduino's circuitry, this article is going to show how to use an ATTiny85 as the target device. A future article will go into the changes needed to use an Arduino as the target device."</em> <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/wayneholder/debugwire">[...]</a>

<p><em>"I have a Creative SoundBlaster Audigy in my main desktop computer and I needed a way to quickly adjust the bass and treble settings (as well as the volume) when listening to audio or video media. I have adapted the code from two sources given in the code-listing, and also in the links at the end, which makes use of an Arduino Micro by the Arduino organisation, or any other ATmega32u4, as a USB Human Interface Device by using the Nico Hood HID-Project libraries. I also use a wireless keyboard which only shows the state of the Caps-lock, Num-lock and Scroll-lock keys for a short time to increase its battery life. I therefore also included three LED's which show the status of these three keyboard functions. Because the Micro can be easily reprogrammed even after putting it into an enclosure through the USB port, you can adapt the code to suit the characteristics of your own sound device and keyboard by substituting the media identification used in the code with your own selection. There is a vast list of all the functions that you can use available at the Nico Hood HID Github website - examine the file named ConsumerAPI.h for all the other HID functions."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Bass-Treble-and-Volume-USB-Controller-With-Keyboar/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Arcade games on the Micro:bit Arcade games on the Micro:bit The Micro:bit is a pretty decent platform for teaching kids to program, but you can't really make arcade-style games for it. You only have two buttons and a 5x5 display. Perhaps enough for a very small snake game, but that's pretty much it. That's why I started working on #PewPew FeatherWing as an alternative platform, but at some point I started wondering if it's really impossible to do it on the micro:bit. When the most recent version of micropython got the ability to use any pins for I2C, I realized that I can finally connect a display easily. I could use a HT16K33 and a 8x8 LED matrix like on the PewPew, but I decided to try something else — a monochrome OLED display, similar to the one used on many Arduino-based game consoles."</em> <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/27757-microboy">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A data logger is an electronic device or instrument that records data over a period of time. It allows the user to record time or location stamped data which can be viewed at a later time or real time. Irrespective of the type of data being logged or the kind of data logger, these devices usually contain two main units, the sensor unit and the storage/communication unit. The sensor unit may involve the use of an external instrument or a sensor embedded within the device. Increasingly, but not entirely, data logging devices are becoming more based on micro processors and microcontrollers, which has opened up a whole new level of data gathering and storage. For today’s tutorial, our focus will be on building an Arduino based data logger that reads the temperature of the environment every few minutes and saves the data in a micro sd card."</em> <a href="http://www.electronics-lab.com/project/simple-arduino-data-logger/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Maxim Integrated recently announced their new series of linear regulators that maintain ±1% output accuracy over a wide operating temperature range with only 12µVrms of noise. If you're looking for a physically small LDO that offers low output noise and a ±1% voltage output accuracy (despite significant load, line, and temperature variations), provides configurable output voltage, and comes with many protection features, you should consider Maxim's new MAX38902x series of LDOs. Within this new series are four regulator types to choose from (they all share the same datasheet): - MAX38902A - MAX38902B - MAX38902C - MAX38902D  Offered in Small Packages Two of the devices from this series, namely the MAX38902A and MAX38902B, are available in a 2 × 2mm, 8-pin TDFN, or thin DFN, package. The other two devices—the MAX38902C and MAX38902D—come in a much smaller package, specifically a 2 × 3 bump, 1.22 × 0.82mm, 0.4mm pitch wafer-level package (WLP). The figure below shows an overview of these two package types. You can find more detailed information in their app note (Application Note 1891) "Wafer-Level Packaging (WLP) and Its Applications" (PDF)."</em> <a href="https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/news/maxim-integrated-low-noise-ldo-delivers-500ma-current/">[...]</a>
