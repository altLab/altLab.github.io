<p>Faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1879, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Hahn">Otto Hahn</a>. Este Químico/físico alemão juntamente com o radio-químico Fritz Strassmann, ficou conhecido pela descoberta da fissão nuclear. Ele recebeu o Prêmio Nobel de Química em 1944 e partilhou o Prêmio Enrico Fermi em 1966 com Strassmann e Lise Meitner. O elemento 105 carrega o nome hahnium em reconhecimento do seu trabalho.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1824, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Elder_(shipbuilder)">John Elder</a>. Este engenheiro escocês, assistido por W.J.M. Rankine, desenvolveu o composto de motores a vapor (1854), dividindo a expansão do vapor em dois cilindros, de modo que cada um se deslocasse através de um intervalo menor de temperaturas e pressões que melhoraram significativamente a eficiência do combustível. O S.S. Brandon navegou em Julho de 1854 com seu primeiro motor deste tipo, que usou menos um terço do carvão do que era necessário antes. Elder continuou a melhorar os seus projectos para serem ainda mais económicos. Como resultado, seu negócio de engenharia no Clyde em Glasgow, na Escócia, continuou a florescer, com mais de 4.000 trabalhadores. Entre 1853 e 1867, a sua empresa submeteu catorze importantes patentes, incluindo um motor de expansão quádrupla (1862).</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1900, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_H._Aiken">Howard H. Aiken</a>. Este Matemático norte-americano inventou o Harvard Mark I, precursor do moderno computador digital electrónico. Enquanto estudante de pós-graduação e instrutor da Universidade de Harvard, a pesquisa de Aiken conduziu-o a um sistema de equações diferenciais que só poderia ser resolvido usando técnicas numéricas, pelo qual ele começou a planear o grande computador. A sua ideia era usar uma adaptação da máquina de cartões perfurados da Hollerith. Quando finalmente construído, (1943) pesava 35 toneladas, tinha 500 milhas de fio e podia calcular até 23 casas significativas. Tinha 72 registos de armazenamento e unidades centrais para realizar a multiplicação e a divisão. Era controlado por uma sequência de instruções em fitas de papel perfurado e usava cartões perfurados para inserir dados e produzir os resultados.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1902, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Blake_(surfer)">Tom Blake</a>. Este norte-americano foi o inventor da prancha de base oca. Após a sua primeira prancha oca experimental em 1926, as suas inovadoras pranchas de surf / paddle de núcleo oco dominaram o mundo do surf até o final da década de 1940. Tornou-se equipamento de salvação padrão no primeiro corpo de guarda-vidas da Califórnia. Os projectos adiantados da prancha de surf consistiram em placas de madeira maciças que remontam aos havaianos antigos, estes quadros novos e mais claros foram um sucesso imediato e tornaram-se extremamente importantes na evolução da prancha de surf moderna. Na década de 1930, ele fez o primeiro grande avanço de design com a invenção de barbatanas.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1924, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Charpak">Georges Charpak</a>. Este físico polaco-francês recebeu o Prémio Nobel de Física em 1992 pela sua invenção e desenvolvimento de detectores de partículas subatómicas, em particular a câmara proporcional multi-fios, um avanço na técnica para explorar as partes mais íntimas da matéria. Como os físicos de partículas concentraram seu interesse em interacções de partículas muito raras, que muitas vezes revelam os segredos das partes internas da matéria, às vezes apenas uma interacção de partículas em um bilião é aquela procurada. Charpak substituiu agora métodos fotográficos inadequados com componentes electrónicos modernos que ligavam o detector directamente a um computador.</p>

<p>Esta semana ficámos a saber que o sistema de energia continental europeu (CE) - uma grande área sincronizada que se estende da Espanha para a Turquia e da Polónia para a Holanda; abrangendo 25 países - está com um desvio contínuo da frequência do sistema do valor médio de 50 Hz, e isto desde meados de Janeiro de 2018. Este desvio provoca alterações nos valores de equipamentos que usam esta frequência para o calculo do tempo. Percebeu-se que este desvio está a ser provocado numa área de controlo chamada Sérvia, Macedónia, Montenegro (bloco SMM) e, mais especificamente, Kosovo e Sérvia. Os desvios de energia levaram a uma ligeira diminuição na média de frequência eléctrica. Este desvio de frequência médio, que nunca aconteceu de forma semelhante no sistema CE Power, deve cessar. A quantidade de energia em falta actualmente é de 113 GWh.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como alguns modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis.</p>

<p><em>"The Continental European (CE) Power System -a large synchronized area stretching from Spain to Turkey and from Poland to Netherlands; encompassing 25 countries- is experiencing a continuous system frequency deviation from the mean value of 50 Hz, and this since mid of January 2018. The power deviations are originating from the control area called Serbia, Macedonia, Montenegro (SMM block) and specifically Kosovo and Serbia. The power deviations have led to a slight decrease in the electric frequency average. This average frequency deviation, that has never happened in any similar way in the CE Power system, must cease. The missing energy amounts currently to 113 GWh. The question of who will compensate for this loss has to be answered."</em> <a href="https://www.entsoe.eu/news-events/announcements/announcements-archive/Pages/News/2018-03-06-press-release-continuing-frequency-deviation-in-the-continental-european-power-system.aspx">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This week, we hosted the Neuro Inspired Computational Elements (NICE) workshop at our Oregon campus with the goal of bringing together researchers from different scientific disciplines to discuss and explore the development of next-generation computing architectures, including neuromorphic computing. Today at the workshop, we provided an update on Intel’s neuromorphic research and announced a collaborative research initiative to encourage experimentation with our Loihi neuromorphic test chip. Here’s a status of our neuromorphic computing efforts and details on this new research community. Where We Are Fabrication and packaging of our Loihi test chip was completed in early November, and we began power-on and validation. We were pleased to find 100 percent functionality, a wide operating margin and few bugs overall. Our small-scale demonstrations that we had prepared on our emulator worked as expected on the real silicon, though, of course, running orders of magnitude faster."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/intel-creates-neuromorphic-research-community/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Simplify development of traditionally complex designs with new PIC® and AVR® families featuring Core Independent Peripherals and Intelligent Analog Whether it’s used as an initial introduction into embedded development, the main controller of a connected application or as an attach component to offload tasks from a larger system, the role of the 8-bit microcontroller (MCU) continues to expand. While inherently simple to understand and implement, additional hardware and software tools, such as Core Independent Peripherals (CIPs), Intelligent Analog and MPLAB® Code Configurator, enable greater processing power while decreasing the amount of code, power consumption and design effort needed to get to market quickly. Microchip Technology Inc. (NASDAQ: MCHP) has introduced two new microcontroller families designed with customer innovation in mind. The new PIC16F18446 family of microcontrollers are ideal components for use in sensor nodes. Designed with flexibility in mind, the PIC16F18446 and its integrated Analog-to-Digital Converter with Computation (ADC2) runs from 1.8V to 5V, providing compatibility with a majority of both analog output sensors and digital sensors. The 12-bit ADC2 does its filtering autonomously, providing more accurate analog sensor readings and ultimately higher-quality end-user data."</em> <a href="https://www.microchip.com/pressreleasepage/digital-control-meets-intelligent-analog">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The goal of the Google Quantum AI lab is to build a quantum computer that can be used to solve real-world problems. Our strategy is to explore near-term applications using systems that are forward compatible to a large-scale universal error-corrected quantum computer. In order for a quantum processor to be able to run algorithms beyond the scope of classical simulations, it requires not only a large number of qubits. Crucially, the processor must also have low error rates on readout and logical operations, such as single and two-qubit gates. Today we presented Bristlecone, our new quantum processor, at the annual American Physical Society meeting in Los Angeles. The purpose of this gate-based superconducting system is to provide a testbed for research into system error rates and scalability of our qubit technology, as well as applications in quantum simulation, optimization, and machine learning."</em> <a href="https://research.googleblog.com/2018/03/a-preview-of-bristlecone-googles-new.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"SpaceX has launched its 50th Falcon 9 rocket mission, and on board is its largest ever geostationary satellite payload, a Hispasat unit that’s around the size of a city bus. The launch took off from Cape Canaveral in Florida this morning and proceeded as planned, delivering Hispasat 30W-6 to its target geostationary transfer orbit. The Standish satellite weighed 6 metric tons and sets a new record for the space company for a satellite of this kind. This marks a big milestone for the Falcon 9 rocket, which began service for SpaceX in 2010 with its first version. SpaceX also recently launched its Falcon Heavy for the first time, and is looking ahead to its next-generation launch craft: The BFR or sometime colloquially called the ‘big f*cking rocket.’"</em> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/05/spacex-successfully-launches-50th-falcon-9-mission/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Data collected by NASA's Juno mission to Jupiter indicate that the atmospheric winds of the gas-giant planet run deep into its atmosphere and last longer than similar atmospheric processes found here on Earth. The findings will improve understanding of Jupiter's interior structure, core mass and, eventually, its origin. Other Juno science results released today include that the massive cyclones that surround Jupiter's north and south poles are enduring atmospheric features and unlike anything else encountered in our solar system. The findings are part of a four-article collection on Juno science results being published in the March 8 edition of the journal Nature. "These astonishing science results are yet another example of Jupiter's curve balls, and a testimony to the value of exploring the unknown from a new perspective with next-generation instruments.Juno's unique orbit and evolutionary high-precision radio science and infrared technologies enabled these paradigm-shifting discoveries," said Scott Bolton, principal investigator of Juno from the Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio. "Juno is only about one third the way through its primary mission, and already we are seeing the beginnings of a new Jupiter.""</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7075">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Academics have high hopes for ferroelectric materials. Adding a single layer of these materials, which have unusual electrical properties, to today’s transistors could radically decrease the power consumption of chips. But as engineers presented the latest research on ferroelectrics at the IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting (IEDM), in San Francisco in December, the mood in the room fluctuated between excitement and doubt. Many in industry are skeptical about the benefits of ferroelectrics. Still, the IEDM meeting made it clear that semiconductor companies are now paying attention.

<p><em>"With the aid of the Compact Muon Solenid detector at the Large Hadron Collider, a Laboratory for Nuclear Science-led group seeks to further understand the building blocks of matter. In research conducted by a group led by MIT Laboratory for Nuclear Science researcher and associate professor of physics Markus Klute, electroweak productions of same-sign W boson pairs were observed, the first such observation of its kind and a milestone toward precision testing of vector boson scattering (W and Z bosons) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The LHC at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, was proposed in the 1980s as a machine to either find the Higgs boson or discover yet unknown particles or interactions. This idea, that the LHC would be able to make a discovery, whatever that might be, is called by theorists No-lose Theorem, and is connected to probing the scattering of W boson pairs at energies above 1 teraelectronvolt (TeV). In 2012, only two years after the first high-energy collision at the LHC, this proposal paid huge dividends when the Higgs boson was discovered by the ATLAS and Compact Muon Solenid (CMS) collaborations. According to CERN, the CMS detector at the LHC utilizes a massive solenoid magnet to study everything from the Higgs boson to dark matter to the Standard Model."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2018/mit-physicists-observe-electroweak-production-same-sign-w-boson-pairs-cms-0227">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Quantum computers may one day solve algorithmic problems which even the biggest supercomputers today can’t manage. But how do you test a quantum computer to ensure it is working reliably? Depending on the algorithmic task, this could be an easy or a very difficult certification problem.

Now physicists at MIT and Harvard University have found the wonder material can exhibit even more curious electronic properties. In two papers published today in Nature, the team reports it can tune graphene to behave at two electrical extremes: as an insulator, in which electrons are completely blocked from flowing; and as a superconductor, in which electrical current can stream through without resistance. Researchers in the past, including this team, have been able to synthesize graphene superconductors by placing the material in contact with other superconducting metals — an arrangement that allows graphene to inherit some superconducting behaviors."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2018/graphene-insulator-superconductor-0305">[...]</a>

<p><em>"ASU researchers find new solution for mitigating dendrite growth, which shows promise for all batteries Lithium-metal batteries are among the most promising candidates for high-density energy storage technology in an expanding range of digital “smart” devices and electrical vehicles, but uncontrolled lithium dendrite growth, which results in poor recharging capability and safety hazards, currently tempers their potential. Dendrites are needle-like growths that appear on the surface of lithium metal, which is used as the anode, or negative electrode, of a battery. They induce unwanted side reactions that reduce energy density, and at worst, cause shorting of the electrodes that can lead to fires or explosions. New research from Arizona State University finds that using a 3-D layer of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), or silicone, as the substrate of the lithium metal anode can mitigate dendrite formation and both dramatically extend battery life and diminish safety risks. The paper, “Stress-driven lithium dendrite growth mechanism and dendrite mitigation by electroplating on soft substrates,” was published today in Nature Energy. According to Hanqing Jiang, a professor in ASU's School for Engineering of Matter, Transport and Energy, in the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering, and a lead researcher on the paper, the findings have relevance for both lithium-ion and lithium-air batteries, as well as implications for other metal-anode-based batteries."</em> <a href="https://asunow.asu.edu/20180307-lithium-related-discovery-could-extend-battery-life-improve-safety">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/news/newsroom/media-releases-and-expert-comments/2018/mar/all-power-to-the-proton">All power to the proton: researchers make battery breakthrough</a></h2>

<p><em>"RMIT University researchers have demonstrated for the first time a working rechargeable “proton battery” that could re-wire how we power our homes, vehicles and devices. The rechargeable battery is environmentally friendly, and has the potential, with further development, to store more energy than currently-available lithium ion batteries. Potential applications for the proton battery include household storage of electricity from solar photovoltaic panels, as done currently by the Tesla 'Power wall' which uses lithium ion batteries. With some modifications and scaling up, proton battery technology may also be used for medium-scale storage on electricity grids - - like the giant lithium battery in South Australia -- as well as powering electric vehicles. The working prototype proton battery uses a carbon electrode as a hydrogen store, coupled with a reversible fuel cell to produce electricity. It’s the carbon electrode plus protons from water that give the proton battery it’s environmental, energy and potential economic edge, says lead researcher Professor John Andrews."</em> <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/news/newsroom/media-releases-and-expert-comments/2018/mar/all-power-to-the-proton">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Fujitsu Laboratories Ltd. and Fujitsu Research and Development Center Co., Ltd. today announced development of technology that can verify, in advance, risks associated with smart contracts, which are programs that automatically execute transactions on blockchain platforms. The technology also identifies relevant locations in the source code. Blockchain technology, which was developed as the foundation for Bitcoin, is expected to have applications in a variety of fields beyond finance, including real estate and healthcare. Because smart contract risks are directly linked with business losses, however, there have been issues with improving their reliability as a system. Now, Fujitsu Laboratories and Fujitsu Research and Development Center have developed algorithms to identify risk-affected transaction sequences on Ethereum(1), a platform for executing blockchain applications, using symbolic execution technology(2). Using these algorithms, they have developed technology that is able to comprehensively detect six types of risks in smart contracts (figure 1), which have the potential to be overlooked in a manual review, and can then identify the relevant locations in the source code."</em> <a href="http://www.fujitsu.com/global/about/resources/news/press-releases/2018/0307-01.html">[...]</a>
