<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1872, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._W._Pierce">George Washington Pierce</a>. Este inventor Norte-americano foi pioneiro em radio-telefonia e professor notável de engenharia de telecomunicações. Ele fez o trabalho que levou à aplicação prática de uma variedade de descobertas experimentais em piezoelétrica e magnetostricção. Ele desenvolveu o oscilador Pierce, que utiliza cristal de quartzo para manter as transmissões de rádio precisamente na frequência atribuída e fornecer precisão similar para medidores de frequência. Ele foi igualmente responsável pela formula de cálculo matemático das propriedades de radiação das antenas de rádio; invenção do tubo de descarga de vapor de mercúrio, que era o precursor do tirantron; invenção de um método de gravação de som em filme; e geração de som por morcegos e insectos.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1875, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Frederick-Mark-Becket">Frederick Mark Becket</a>. Este Metalúrgico canadiano detinha mais de cem patentes, cobrindo uma ampla gama de produtos eléctricos para forno e produtos químicos, nomeadamente ligas de ferro, carboneto de cálcio e aços especiais de crómio. Ele desenvolveu um processo de uso de silício em vez de carbono como um agente redutor na produção de metais, tornando as ligas de ferro com baixo teor de carbono e certos aços práticos. Os seus processos para a produção de ligas de ferro de baixo carbono tiveram aplicação mundial.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1895, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurens_Hammond">Laurens Hammond</a>. Este inventor e empresário norte-americano ficou conhecido pela criação do órgão electrónico de Hammond. Fascinado pela ciência, Hammond patenteou a sua primeira invenção, uma transmissão de automóveis, enquanto era muito jovem. Em 1909, ele vendeu sua ideia para um barómetro barato e sensível, e em 1920, ele vendeu o seu design para um relógio "sem engrenagens". Em 1933, ele abriu um piano antigo retirando todo o seu conteúdo com excepção do teclado para usar como controlador. Ele experimentou várias maneiras diferentes de gerar o som até encontrar o que parecia melhor - o gerador do "tonewheel", com o qual ele fundou a Hammond Organ Company. Durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial, Laurens ajudou a projectar controlos de mísseis guiados com patentes para orientação de bombas.</p>

<p>Nas semana que passou ficámos a saber que um empregado da FedEx do Tennessee conseguiu descobrir, um novo número primo da classe de números primos de Mersenne - o 50º. Os primos de Mersenne são um grupo de números primos nomeados em honra do monge francês Marin Mersenne, que estudou os números há mais de três séculos. O número tem mais de 23 milhões de dígitos - 1 milhão de dígitos a mais do que o 49º prémio Mersenne conhecido, descoberto em Janeiro de 2016. Este número foi descoberto através dos esforços conjugados do projecto GIMPS -  Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search. O número, designado de M77232917, é calculado elevando o número 2 à potência 77.232.917 e depois subtraindo 1.</p>

<p>Também esta semana, a Wifi-Aliance fez o anuncio de um novo standard de segurança de redes Wifi - WPA3. Este vem responder às necessidades de substituir o actual WPA2 que tem alguns problemas no seu design nomeadamente o que ficou conhecido como KRACK e que está relacionado com o seu mecanismo de "four-way handshake". Para ultrapassar esta situação este novo protocolo corrige esta falha e resta agora esperar que a adopção seja rápida por parte dos fabricantes de Hardware.</p>

<p>Ainda esta semana ficámos a saber que a tentativa da SpaceX para lançar no espaço um "payload" secreto designado por Zuma terá falhado o seu objectivo e a carga se deve ter perdido. Esta foi a primeira vez que a SpaceX teve que usar um sistema de 3 foguetões combinados. O lançamento aparentemente foi um sucesso mas posteriormente a informação que apareceu no meus de comunicação indicou que uma falha qualquer terá provocado a perda. Como se trata de uma missão da qual pouco se sabe a informação é muito escassa.</p>

<p>A Boeing apresentou um protótipo funcional de um drone de transporte de carga. Em menos de três meses, os engenheiros da Boeing projectaram e construíram o protótipo do CAV, que fica a quatro metros do chão, mede 15 por 18 pés e pesa mais de 700 libras. É equipado com oito lâminas de hélice com contra-rotação e baterias Boeing personalizadas que permitem o voo vertical.</p>

<p>Está também a decorrer esta semana a CES2018 em Las Vegas e têm sido feitos anúncios de diversos produtos que que irão brevemente aparecer no mercado.
Destes destacam-se as apresentações dos novos processadores da Intel com um processador gráfico Radeon. A AMD apresentou também os seus novos processadores Ryzen e Radeon. A Toyota lançou um ecossistema de mobilidade de veículos. A Intel apresentou avanços na tecnologia de "quantum computing" criando um chip teste de 49-qubit. A HyperX apresentou o primeiro módulo de memória sincronizado por infravermelhos. A Qualcomm apresentou um sistema de bluetooth audio de muito baixo consumo que poderá revolucionar ainda mais esta área. E por fim a Razer apresenta o projecto Linda que se trata de um Híbrido entre um portátil e um smartphone. Atrás das cenas e junto ao evento foi possível presenciar um show de "strip" com robôs.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. É apresentada a revista newelectronics de 9 de Janeiro e dois livros, introdução ao Linux e "Linux from Scratch" Versão 8.1.</p>

<p><em>"A FedEx employee from Tennessee has made mathematical history with the discovery of the largest known prime number. Jonathan Pace, a 51-year-old engineer living in Germantown, Tennessee, discovered the number after running a special piece of computational software for six days straight. Pace is a volunteer for a project called the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS). Thousands, armed with "reasonably modern" computers and GIMPS software, volunteer on the project, according to the GIMPS website. The number, called M77232917, is the 50th "Mersenne prime" to be discovered. Mersenne primes are a group of prime numbers named for the French monk Marin Mersenne, who studied the numbers more than three centuries ago."</em> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/05/largest-known-prime-number-discovered-by-fedex-employee.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/08/spacex-apparently-lost-the-classified-zuma-payload-from-latest-launch/?ncid=rss">SpaceX apparently lost the classified Zuma payload from latest launch</a></h2>

<p><em>"SpaceX’s latest rocket may have launched successfully – but the mission didn’t end as a win. The Zuma payload it was carrying, a mysterious classified piece of cargo for the U.S. government believed to be a spy satellite, was lost after it failed to separate from the second stage of the rocket after the first stage of the Falcon 9 separated as planned and returned to Earth. The WSJ reports, and we’ve confirmed separately, that the payload is thought to have fallen back through the Earth’s atmosphere after reaching space, because of the failure to separate. The failure is one that can happen when cargo doesn’t properly detach as planned, since the second stage is designed to fall back to Earth and burn up in re-entry. SpaceX had launched as planned on January 7 in its target window, and recovered the first stage of the booster with a landing at its Cape Canaveral facility. Because of the nature of the mission, coverage and information regarding the progress of the rocket and its payload from then on was not disclosed."</em> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/08/spacex-apparently-lost-the-classified-zuma-payload-from-latest-launch/?ncid=rss">[...]</a>

They demonstrated that the effect, also known as quantum nonlocality, can still be verified even when many of the photons are lost by absorption or scattering as they travel from source to destination through an optical fiber channel. The experimental study and techniques are published in the journal Science Advances. Quantum nonlocality is important in the development of new global quantum information networks, which will have transmission security guaranteed by the laws of physics. These are the networks where powerful quantum computers can be linked.

In physics, on the other hand, the possibility that our universe comprises more than three spatial dimensions was first proposed in the wake of Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity in the 1920s. Modern string theory – trying to reconcile Einstein’s ideas with the laws of quantum mechanics – even postulates up to 10 dimensions. In a completely different context, an international team of researchers led by Professor Immanuel Bloch (LMU/MPQ) and Professor Oded Zilberberg (ETH Zürich) has now demonstrated a way to observe physical phenomena proposed to exist in higher-dimensional systems in analogous real-world experiments. Using ultracold atoms trapped in a periodically modulated two-dimensional superlattice potential, the scientists could observe a dynamical version of a novel type of quantum Hall effect that is predicted to occur in four-dimensional systems.

While every new generation of auto tech brings new security risks, the vulnerabilities that come along with advanced mobility are both unprecedented and under-studied, the paper states."</em> <a href="http://ns.umich.edu/new/releases/25354-cybersecurity-in-self-driving-cars-u-m-releases-threat-identification-tool">[...]</a>

Existing fiber-based wearable displays’ OLEDs show much lower performance compared to those fabricated on planar substrates.

<p><em>"A Northwestern Engineering professor, working in conjunction with the global beauty company L’Oréal, has developed the smallest wearable device in the world. The wafer-thin, feather-light sensor can fit on a fingernail and precisely measures a person’s exposure to UV light from the sun. The device, as light as a raindrop and smaller in circumference than an M&amp;M, is powered by the sun and contains the world’s most sophisticated and accurate UV dosimeter. It was unveiled Sunday, Jan. 7, at the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas and will be called UV Sense. “We think it provides the most convenient, most accurate way for people to measure sun exposure in a quantitative manner,” said John A. Rogers, the Louis Simpson and Kimberly Querrey Professor of Materials Science and Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, and Neurological Surgery in Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering. “The broader goal is to provide a technology platform that can save lives and reduce skin cancers by allowing individuals, on a personalized level, to modulate their exposure to the sun.” UV Sense has no moving parts, no battery, is waterproof and can be attached to almost any part of the body or clothing, where it continuously measures UV exposure in a unique accumulation mode."</em> <a href="http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/news/articles/2018/01/researchers-develop-worlds-smallest-wearable-device.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers at The University of Manchester have devised graphene sensors embedded into RFIDs, which have the potential to revolutionise the Internet of Things (IoT). By layering graphene-oxide (a derivative of graphene) over graphene to create a flexible heterostructure the team have developed humidity sensors for remote sensing with the ability to connect to any wireless network. Graphene was the world’s first two-dimensional material isolated in 2004 at The University of Manchester, it is stronger than steel, lightweight, flexible and more conductive than copper. Since then a whole family of other 2D materials have been discovered and continues to grow. Using graphene and other 2D materials, scientists can layer these materials, similar to stacking bricks of Lego in a precisely chosen sequence known as van der Waals heterostructures to create high-performance structures tailored to a specific purpose. As reported in Scientific Reports, the groundbreaking nature of this development is that such sensors can be printed layer-by-layer for scalable and mass production at very low cost."</em> <a href="http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/manchester-scientists-develop-graphene-sensors-that-could-revolutionise-the-internet-of-things/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"There is always a need for automating a process,be it a simple/monstrous one.I got the idea to do this project from a simple challenge that i faced while finding methods to water/irrigate our small piece of land.The problem of no current supply lines and costly generators (to operate our pump) added to the difficulty. So what we decided to do is device a method which would be cheap and easy to use,even by a worker.We decided to mount the pump on our old scooter(running condition) and run it using the shaft of the scooter wheel.All fine and good,we made the mechanical assembly and the belt drive and tested it,and it was a success. But another problem was that,when the motor was running,a person always had to be near the scooter to monitor the RPM,and manually adjust it using throttle.So this project was made by us so that the worker can set the desired RPM he wants to make the engine run,and attend to other work in the farm. The setup consists of : A IR based tachometer(to measure RPM). A keypad to enter the RPM. A LCD display to show the monitored RPM and current RPM."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Autonomous-Control-of-RPM-of-Engine-Using-Feedback/">[...]</a>

An additional unexpected benefit is that the Mega1284 build has a much lower noise component - to the extent that when I compare the Uno and the Mega1284 using the same support circuitry it is not unreasonable to describe the Uno as "noisy" and the Mega1284 as "quiet". The larger RAM means that a much longer delay effect can be obtained - and that is demonstrated by the Arduino sketch example that I have included. The background breathing noise when using the Tremelo effect is also (almost) absent with the ATMega1284. I started by bread-boarding the Uno-based pedalSHIELD as in the Electrosmash specification but I did not have the same RRO OpAmp as specified.

Along the way, I learned that creating a new IoT device, from idea to prototype to final product, is not as simple as I thought it would be, and there was no "ready-to-go" development device to start with. However, by figuring out how to do it, I created a new product called Siguino, an open source IoT circuit board, that I hope will make it easier and faster for other people to create their own IoT products. Siguino is based on a low-power version of the Arduino Pro Mini that has onboard sensors and antenna and runs off a single battery. It also leverages Sigfox, a low-power wide area network designed to connect IoT devices to the cloud.
