<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1842, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Dewar">James Dewar</a>. Este Químico e físico escocês reduziu a linha que separa a física da química e avançou a fronteira de pesquisa em vários campos na mudança do século XX. Ele deu palestras e seu estudo de fenómenos de baixa temperatura implicava fazer o frasco de Dewar, um frasco isolante de parede dupla de seu próprio desenho, criando um vácuo entre as duas camadas prateadas de aço ou vidro (1892), o que levou à criação da Garrafa térmica doméstica. Em Junho de 1897, o The Scientific American informou que "Dewar acaba de liquidificar o flúor a uma temperatura de -185 ºC". Ele obteve hidrogénio líquido em 1898. Dewar também inventou cordite, a primeira pólvora sem fumo.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que os cientista identificaram três causas para o desvio do eixo de rotação da Terra. A Terra não é uma esfera perfeita. Quando gira no seu eixo de rotação - uma linha imaginária que passa pelos pólos norte e sul - ele oscila e desvia-se. Estes movimentos do eixo de rotação são cientificamente referidos como "movimento polar". As medições para o século XX mostram que o eixo de rotação se desloca cerca de 10 centímetros por ano. Ao longo de um século, isto é mais de 10 metros. Utilizando dados observados e baseados em modelos que abrangem todo o século XX, os cientistas da NASA identificaram pela primeira vez três processos amplamente categorizados como responsáveis por esse desvio - a perda de massa contemporânea na Groenlândia, a recuperação glacial e a convecção do manto.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como alguns modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis. São apresentadas as revistas hackspace nº11 e a revista Hello World nº6.</p>

<p><em>"A typical desk globe is designed to be a geometric sphere and to rotate smoothly when you spin it. Our actual planet is far less perfect -- in both shape and in rotation. Earth is not a perfect sphere. When it rotates on its spin axis -- an imaginary line that passes through the North and South Poles -- it drifts and wobbles. These spin-axis movements are scientifically referred to as "polar motion." Measurements for the 20th century show that the spin axis drifted about 4 inches (10 centimeters) per year."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7240">[...]</a>

This is the first time that lasing has been achieved in non-metallic nanostructures, and it promises to lead to miniature lasers usable in a wide range of optoelectronic devices. Microscale lasers are widely used in devices such as CD and DVD players. Now, optical engineers are developing nanoscale lasers — so small that they cannot be seen by the human eye. A promising method is to use arrays of tiny structures made from semiconductors with a high refractive index. Such structures act as tiny antennas, resonating at specific wavelengths."</em> <a href="https://research.a-star.edu.sg/research/7943/shrinking-semiconductor-lasers-to-the-nanoscale">[...]</a>

<p><em>"An international team of researchers led by ANU has invented a tiny camera lens, which may lead to a device that links quantum computers to an optical fibre network. Quantum computers promise a new era in ultra-secure networks, artificial intelligence and therapeutic drugs, and will be able to solve certain problems much faster than today's computers. The unconventional lens, which is 100 times thinner than a human hair, could enable a fast and reliable transfer of quantum information from the new-age computers to a network, once these technologies are fully realised. The device is made of a silicon film with millions of nano-structures forming a metasurface, which can control light with functionalities outperforming traditional systems. Associate Professor Andrey Sukhorukov said the metasurface camera lens was highly transparent, thereby enabling efficient transmission and detection of information encoded in quantum light. "It is the first of its kind to image several quantum particles of light at once, enabling the observation of their spooky behaviour with ultra-sensitive cameras," said Associate Professor Sukhorukov, who led the research with a team of scientists at the Nonlinear Physics Centre of the ANU Research School of Physics and Engineering."</em> <a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/news/all-news/tiny-camera-lens-may-help-link-quantum-computers-to-network">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Engineers at the University of Maryland have created a thin battery, made of a few million carefully constructed “microbatteries” in a square inch. Each microbattery is shaped like a very tall, round room, providing much surface area – like wall space – on which nano-thin battery layers are assembled. The thin layers together with large surface area produces very high power along with high energy. It is dubbed a “3D battery” because each microbattery has a distinctly 3D shape. These 3-D batteries push conventional planar thin-film solid state batteries into a third dimension. Planar batteries are a single stack of flat layers serving the roles of anode, electrolyte, cathode and current collectors."</em> <a href="https://eng.umd.edu/news/story/a-new-dimension-for-batteries">[...]</a>

<p><em>"New study sheds (laser) light on the best means of laying down thin-film circuitry. Printed electronics use standard printing techniques to manufacture electronic devices on different substrates like glass, plastic films, and paper. Interest in this area is growing because of the potential to create cheaper circuits more efficiently than conventional methods. A new study by researchers at Soonchunhyang University in South Korea, published in AIP Advances, from AIP Publishing, provides insights into the processing of copper nanoparticle ink with green laser light. Kye-Si Kwon and his colleagues previously worked with silver nanoparticle ink, but they turned to copper (derived from copper oxide) as a possible low-cost alternative. Metallic inks composed of nanoparticles hold an advantage over bulk metals because of their lower melting points."</em> <a href="https://publishing.aip.org/publishing/journal-highlights/laser-sintering-optimized-printed-electronics">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Cheap and accessible cobalt-based catalysts could fast-track the industrial-scale production of hydrogen from water. A low-cost and simple alternative to expensive platinum-based catalysts that generate hydrogen from water could soon be available, thanks to A*STAR researchers. A team from A*STAR’s Institute of Materials Research and Engineering has developed a one-step approach to synthesize cobalt phosphides that exhibit good electrochemical activity in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). “Unlike the expensive and scarce platinum-based catalysts, these phosphorus-functionalized cobalt catalysts are particularly promising because of their long-term stability and suitability to large scale industrial implementation,” explains Yun Zong, who led the team with Zhaolin Liu. Hydrogen is an energy-dense, clean and renewable fuel source that plays a key role in many industrial processes, such as the production of ammonia as well as the processing and refining of fossil fuels. Yet, it is predominantly produced through the steam reforming of natural gas, a high-temperature extraction from hydrocarbons that emits carbon dioxide in large quantities."</em> <a href="https://research.a-star.edu.sg/research/7920/stepping-up-water-splitting">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A novel insect-inspired flying robot, developed by TU Delft researchers from the Micro Air Vehicle Laboratory (MAVLab), has been presented in Science (14 September 2018). Experiments with this first autonomous, free-flying and agile flapping-wing robot – carried out in collaboration with Wageningen University &amp; Research – improved our understanding of how fruit flies control aggressive escape manoeuvres. Apart from its further potential in insect flight research, the robot’s exceptional flight qualities open up new drone applications. Flying animals both power and control flight by flapping their wings. This enables small natural flyers such as insects to hover close to a flower, but also to rapidly escape danger, which everyone has witnessed when trying to swat a fly. Animal flight has always drawn the attention of biologists, who not only study their complex wing motion patterns and aerodynamics, but also their sensory and neuro-motor systems during such agile manoeuvres."</em> <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/2018/tu-delft/novel-flying-robot-mimics-rapid-insect-flight/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers identify an essential protein that helps enzymes relax overtwisted DNA so each strand can be copied during cell division. DNA is a lengthy molecule — approximately 1,000-fold longer than the cell in which it resides — so it can’t be jammed in haphazardly. Rather, it must be neatly organized so proteins involved in critical processes can access the information contained in its nucleotide bases. Think of the double helix like a pair of shoe laces twisted together, coiled upon themselves again and again to make the molecule even more compact. However, when it comes time for cell division, this supercoiled nature makes it difficult for proteins involved in DNA replication to access the strands, separate them, and copy them so one DNA molecule can become two. Replication begins at specific regions of the chromosome where specialized proteins separate the two strands, pulling apart the double helix as you would the two shoe laces."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2018/mit-researchers-detangle-dna-replication-0917">[...]</a>

In a paper published online Sept. 5 by Advanced Materials Technologies, a team of Lab researchers report developing convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a popular type of algorithm primarily used to process images and videos, to predict whether a part will be good by looking at as little as 10 milliseconds of video. “This is a revolutionary way to look at the data that you can label video by video, or better yet, frame by frame,” said principal investigator and LLNL researcher Brian Giera. “The advantage is that you can collect video while you’re printing something and ultimately make conclusions as you’re printing it. A lot of people can collect this data, but they don’t know what to do with it on the fly, and this work is a step in that direction.” Often, Giera explained, sensor analysis done post-build is expensive and part quality can be determined only long after."</em> <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/news/llnl-explores-machine-learning-prevent-defects-metal-3d-printed-parts-real-time">[...]</a>

It is important to develop a way to measure the charge in a single self-assembled quantum dot to achieve quantum information processing; however, this is difficult because the metal electrodes needed for the measurement can screen out the very small charge of the quantum dot. Researchers at Osaka University have recently developed the first device based on two self-assembled quantum dots that can measure the single-electron charge of one quantum dot using a second as a sensor.

This gives you the ability to change the sound, tone and speed of the synth making for a much more varied sound machine then the first Fizzle Loop synth. I also used 2 vactrols (check out step 3 on what these are if you havent heard of them before) which connect the flashing LEDs circuits to the light Theremin circuit.

Modern smartphone cameras can take and save high-quality images as well, but users can’t select the appropriate lens for a situation and control the aperture, shutter speed, and ISO setting directly. Features like these give skilled DSLR users the ability to set up a shot to their exact specifications. These cameras are also compatible with a wide variety of accessories like intervalometers, which release the camera’s shutter at controlled intervals. If you’ve ever seen a video with stars moving across the night sky, or a seed germinating and growing into a young plant, then you have seen an intervalometer in action.

So I decided to use an Arduino to automate the password-typing process and stored the password securely in the microcontroller.

<p><em>"A 16x7-Segment LED Clock that syncs time from GPS satellites. I read somewhere about UNIX Epoch time (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) and thought wouldn't it be neat to have a clock that showed time in this format? This project developed from that idea.I had a dis-used GPS module with serial output so I thought it would also be cool to use that for syncing the time and thus avoiding setting the clock manually. The final clock has the following features and characteristics: - 16 digit 7-segment LED display. - Date/Time display EPOCH format (seconds elapsed since 1970-01-01). - Date/Time display ISO-8601 format ((YYYY.MM.DD.HH.MM.SS)."</em> <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/161257-gpsclock">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Welcome to another instructable. In this instructable I will discuss how to make a crude spectrophotometer. I will show you what sensors work best, and how to use Python for dynamically updating and displaying the data. Overall I will be evaluating how effective or useful this will be to hobbyists, who want to learn more about it. I personally had no idea how one worked so I thought I'd research the idea. At the time I was particularly interested in finding out how much chlorine was in my drinking water (my tap water has a chlorine smell/taste when I use it to make coffee)."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Python-Powered-Spectrophotometer/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"To fulfill the requests of several followers who have experience with small models of Arduino Bluetooth, today well discuss ESP32 Bluetooth Low Energy. This is highly recommended for the Internet of Things. The Arduino TX RX model works as a serial; but the subject today is a bit different. This is because its power consumption is miniscule. Let us therefore find out more about the BLE and create a program for ESP32 to become a Bluetooth server. This will connect a smartphone application to send and receive data."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/ESP32-Bluetooth-Low-Energy/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A few weeks ago we had the first version of this project, the portable soldering iron V1.0 and that had a few problems. The main problem was the soldering tip that I've used. It was very low quality but I wanted that tip because it had the thermocouple and heating element with separated wires. But now, I've got a much better tip, the T12. This one has the thermocouple and heating element in series so the circuit is different and the temperature sensing as well. But the results are MUCH better."</em> <a href="https://www.electronoobs.com/eng_arduino_tut42.php">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This will be another video about Arduino, my friends. We wont be speaking about the biggest Arduino this time, but rather the worlds smallest Arduino: Attiny85! Let's prepare the Arduino IDE to work with Digispark's Attiny85 module and implement a temperature and humidity monitor with the possibility of an adjustable trigger. Our assembly is very simple: we have the well-known DHT22; the Attiny85, a chip that can be smaller than the SMD voltage regulator; and an i2c OLED display. I want to make it clear that I chose the Attiny85 module from Digispark because I found it easier to handle, but it is fine if you want to program only the Attiny chip. However, you'll need a serial USB converter."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/ATTINY-the-Worlds-Smallest-Arduino/">[...]</a>
