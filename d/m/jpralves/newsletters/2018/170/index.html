<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1788, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_Gmelin">Leopold Gmelin</a>. Este químico alemão descobriu o ferro-cianeto de potássio (1822), inventou o teste de Gmelin para pigmentos biliares e pesquisou a química da digestão. Ele publicou o notável Handbook of Chemistry para pesquisar exaustivamente o assunto. Esta foi a primeira actualização completa desde o tempo de Lavoisier. A química orgânica foi um dos três volumes da primeira edição (1817). Assim, Gmelin reforçou a distinção entre compostos inorgânicos, assim como Berzelius, que cunhou o nome orgânico, apenas uma década antes, para substâncias encontradas em tecidos vivos ou outrora vivos. Na quarta edição (1843), o trabalho de Gmelin expandiu-se para nove volumes, dos quais seis eram sobre química orgânica. Gmelin atribuiu os nomes de éster, cetona e ácido racémico.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1820, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tyndall">John Tyndall</a>. Este físico irlandês demonstrou o porquê do céu ser azul. Ele tornou-se conhecido para o mundo científico em 1848 como autor de um trabalho substancial sobre cristais. Ele estudou as propriedades acústicas da atmosfera e a cor azul do céu, que ele sugeriu ser devido à dispersão da luz por pequenas partículas de água. A sua reputação científica inicial foi baseada num estudo de dia-magnetismo. Ele realizou pesquisas sobre o calor radiante, estudou a geração espontânea e a teoria dos germes da doença, o movimento dos glaciares, o som, a difusão da luz na atmosfera e uma série de tópicos relacionados. Ele mostrou que o ozono era um aglomerado de oxigénio em vez de um composto de hidrogénio, e inventou o respirador firemans e fez outras invenções menos conhecidas, incluindo melhores alertas de nevoeiro. Uma de suas invenções mais importantes, o tubo de luz, levou ao desenvolvimento de fibra óptica. O moderno instrumento de luz é conhecido como gastroscópio, que permite observações internas do estômago do paciente sem cirurgia.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1835, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisha_Gray">Elisha Gray</a>. Este inventor norte-americano submeteu as suas ideias para um telefone no escritório de patentes (14 de Fevereiro de 1876) poucas horas depois de Alexander Graham Bell. Numa famosa batalha legal, Bell recebeu prioridade. Gray trabalhou mais tarde para a Western Electric, onde projectou a impressora telegráfica, a caixa de resposta da A.D.T., e o anunciador de agulha, entre outras invenções. Ele também foi o criador acidental do primeiro instrumento musical electrónico, um oscilador básico de uma única nota usando um circuito electromagnético auto-vibrante. Para ouvir essa nota, ele fez um dispositivo de alto-falante simples com um diafragma vibrando num campo magnético. O seu primeiro "telégrafo musical" ou "telégrafo harmónico" tinha circuitos de uma única nota suficientes para tocar duas oitavas e, mais tarde, ele acrescentava um controle de roda de tom simples.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1943, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_A._Perret">Frank A. Perret</a>. Este engenheiro e inventor norte-americano que mais tarde se tornou um vulcanólogo de campo pioneiro. Usando a sua experiência anterior nos laboratórios de Thomas Edison, aos 20 anos, Perret co-fundou a Elektron Mfg Co. em Brooklyn, NY, desenvolvendo os motores, dínamos e controles eléctricos que a empresa fabricava (e mais tarde, elevadores). O primeiro elevador eléctrico americano (1887) foi provavelmente alimentado por um motor Elektron. Ele começou uma segunda carreira em 1904 como um vulcanólogo, usando o seu conhecimento eléctrico para medir sua actividade sísmica. Ele tornou-se conhecido por seus estudos no Vesúvio (1906), Etna (1910), Stromboli e Kilauea (1911). A partir de 1929, ele viveu no sopé do Mont Pelée, Martinica, onde fundou um memorial museu vulcânico.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou foi publicado um estudo que apresenta dados, obtidos a partir da leitura de varrimentos de radar, da existência de um reservatório de agua em Marte. Este tem cerca de 19 km de comprimento e encontra-se perto do pólo sul deste planeta. Este reservatório de agua salgada não é provavelmente o único. “Existem outras áreas que parecem semelhantes. Não há razão para dizer que este é o único”, diz Elena Pettinelli, da Universidade Roma Tre, na Itália, co-autora do jornal que relatou a descoberta na revista Science.</p>

<p>Também esta semana ficámos a saber que a Estação Espacial Internacional é oficialmente o lar da experiência mais fria no espaço. O Laboratório Cold Atom da NASA (CAL) foi instalado no laboratório científico da estação nos EUA no final de maio e agora produz nuvens de átomos super-frios conhecidos como condensados de Bose-Einstein. Essas "BECs" atingem temperaturas muito pouco acima do zero absoluto, o ponto em que os átomos deveriam teoricamente parar de se mover inteiramente. Esta é a primeira vez que os BECs já foram produzidos em órbita. O CAL é uma instalação multi-utilizador dedicada ao estudo de leis fundamentais da natureza usando gases quânticos ultra-frios em micro-gravidade. Átomos frios são partículas quânticas de longa duração, precisamente controladas, que fornecem uma plataforma ideal para o estudo de fenómenos quânticos e potenciais aplicações de tecnologias quânticas.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como um modelo 3D que poderá ser útil. É apresentada a revista newlectronics de 24 de Julho.</p>

<p><em>"The 12-mile-wide reservoir could solve a Martian mystery—and offer a new target in the hunt for extraterrestrial life. Liquid water is refreshingly abundant on moons in the outer solar system, but it has proven surprisingly tough to find in reliable quantities on Mars—until now. Radar scans of the red planet suggest that a stable reservoir of salty, liquid water measuring some 12 miles across lies nearly a mile beneath the planet’s south pole. What’s more, the underground lake is not likely to be alone. “There are other areas that seem to be similar. There’s no reason to say this is the only one,” says Elena Pettinelli of Italy’s Roma Tre University, a coauthor of the paper reporting the discovery today in the journal Science."</em> <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2018/07/news-lake-found-mars-water-polar-cap-life-space/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The International Space Station is officially home to the coolest experiment in space. NASA's Cold Atom Laboratory (CAL) was installed in the station's U.S. science lab in late May and is now producing clouds of ultracold atoms known as Bose-Einstein condensates. These "BECs" reach temperatures just above absolute zero, the point at which atoms should theoretically stop moving entirely. This is the first time BECs have ever been produced in orbit. CAL is a multiuser facility dedicated to the study of fundamental laws of nature using ultracold quantum gases in microgravity. Cold atoms are long-lived, precisely controlled quantum particles that provide an ideal platform for the study of quantum phenomena and potential applications of quantum technologies."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7202">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Zephyr S, Airbus’ High-Altitude-Pseudo-Satellite, has surpassed the current flight endurance record of an aircraft without refueling of 14 days, 22 minutes and 8 seconds and continues to pioneer the stratosphere. The Zephyr aircraft departed for its maiden flight from Arizona, USA on 11th July 2018. This first flight of the Zephyr S aims to prove and demonstrate the aircraft capabilities, with the final endurance record to be confirmed on landing. About the Airbus Zephyr Programme: solar-powered aircraft, providing a wide scope of applications, ranging for example from maritime surveillance and services, border patrol missions, communications, forest fire detection and monitoring, or navigation. Operating in the stratosphere at an average altitude of 70,000 feet / 21 kilometers, the ultra-lightweight Zephyr has a wingspan of 25 meters and a weigh of less than 75kg, and flies above weather (clouds, jet streams) and above regular air traffic, covering local or regional footprints. Ideally suited for "local persistence" (ISR/Intelligence, Surveillance &amp; Reconnaissance), the Zephyr has the ability to stay focused on a specific area of interest (which can be hundreds of miles wide) while providing it with satellite-like communications and Earth observation services (with greater imagery granularity) over long periods of time without interruption."</em> <a href="https://www.airbus.com/newsroom/press-releases/en/2018/07/Zephyr-S-set-to-break-aircraft-world-endurance-record.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.aalto.fi/en/current/news/2018-07-30/">Illuminating electronics: Researchers construct all-optical pocket calculator</a></h2>

<p><em>"New findings from Aalto University have the potential to change how electronics process logic functions, the elementary building blocks of computing. Our daily lives rely on electronic processors, which perform the basic arithmetic, logical, and control operations that make devices from mobile phones to smart TVs possible. Current technologies are, however, approaching their limits and researchers around the world are looking to enable the next generation of computing. In their paper now published in Science Advances, an interdisciplinary team of researchers at Aalto University show how a new type of nanowire-based nanostructure enables light to perform logic functions, allowing simple addition and subtraction operations. The study, the first to demonstrate nanoscale all-optical logic circuits, provides a vital step in the journey towards true optical computing. ‘We’re able to perform binary number calculations and show, for instance, how this nanostructure can carry out these functions just like a simple pocket calculator—except that instead of using electricity, the nanostructure uses only light in its operation,’ says Dr. Henri Jussila, who completed a post-doc at the university on the topic."</em> <a href="http://www.aalto.fi/en/current/news/2018-07-30/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scientists at the United Technologies Research Center and UConn are using advanced additive manufacturing technology to create ‘smart’ machine components that alert users when they are damaged or worn. The researchers also applied a variation of the technology to create polymer-bonded magnets with intricate geometries and arbitrary shapes, opening up new possibilities for manufacturing and product design. The key to both innovations is the use of an advanced form of 3D printing called direct write technology. Unlike conventional additive manufacturing, which uses lasers to fuse layers of fine metal powder into a solid object, direct write technology uses semisolid metal ‘ink’ that is extruded from a nozzle. The viscosity of the metal ink looks like toothpaste being squeezed from a tube. This process allowed the UConn-UTRC scientists to create fine lines of conductive silver filament that can be embedded into 3D printed machine components while they are being made."</em> <a href="https://today.uconn.edu/2018/07/smart-machine-components-alert-users-damage-wear/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/news/news/better-way-found-determine-integrity-metals">Better way found to determine the integrity of metals</a></h2>

<p><em>"Researchers at the University of Waterloo have found a better way to identify atomic structures, an essential step in improving materials selection in the aviation, construction and automotive industries. The findings of the study could result in greater confidence when determining the integrity of metals. Devinder Kumar, a PhD candidate in systems design engineering at Waterloo, collaborated with the Fritz Haber Institute (FHI) in Berlin, to develop a powerful AI model that can accurately detect different atomic structures in metallic materials. The system can find imperfections in the metal that were previously undetectable. “Anywhere you have metals you want to know the consistency, and that can’t be done in current practical scenarios because current methods fail to identify the symmetry in imperfect conditions,” said Kumar, who is a member of the Vision and Image Processing Research Group under the supervision of Alexander Wong, a professor at Waterloo and Canada Research Chair in the area of artificial intelligence. “So, this new method of evaluating metallic material will lead to better material design overall and has the potential to affect all the industries where you need material designing properties.” FHI came up with a new scenario that can artificially create data which relates to the real world."</em> <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/news/news/better-way-found-determine-integrity-metals">[...]</a>

Because processing information with light can be more efficient than with electrons used in current devices, there is good reason to confine light onto a chip. But light and the bits of information it carries tend to leak and scatter out of the tiny components that must fit on a chip. A Purdue University-led effort has built a novel cladding along the highways for light travel, called waveguides, to prevent information leaks – particularly around sharp bends where light bounces off track and scatters. Information then gets lost or jumbled rather than communicated throughout a device."</em> <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2018/Q3/trapping-light-that-doesnt-bounce-off-track-for-faster-electronics.html">[...]</a>

This would improve performance in low power environments such as smartphones or make for more efficient supercomputers, says a University of Michigan researcher. “Historically, the semiconductor industry has improved performance by making devices faster. But although the processors and memories are very fast, they can’t be efficient because they have to wait for data to come in and out,” said Wei Lu, U-M professor of electrical and computer engineering and co-founder of memristor startup Crossbar Inc. Memristors might be the answer. Named as a portmanteau of memory and resistor, they can be programmed to have different resistance states—meaning they store information as resistance levels. These circuit elements enable memory and processing in the same device, cutting out the data transfer bottleneck experienced by conventional computers in which the memory is separate from the processor."</em> <a href="https://news.umich.edu/memory-processing-unit-could-bring-memristors-to-the-masses/">[...]</a>

Instead, they found the catalyst in question starts nanotubes with a variety of chiral angles but redirects almost all of them toward a fast-growing variant known as (12,6). The cause appears to be a Janus-like interface that is composed of armchair and zigzag segments – and ultimately changes how nanotubes grow.

<p><em>"Yale researchers have designed a new system to keep tomorrow’s quantum computers from “leaking.” Large-scale quantum computers are still years away, but it is well known that they will need error correction. All of the components in a quantum computer are connected in a fragile, entangled state that allows a quantum computer to solve problems that would be impossible on a classical computer. Because of this entanglement, an error in just one bit of quantum information, called a qubit — or even the act of measuring a qubit — can collapse the entire enterprise. Unfortunately, researchers say, the process of correcting errors is itself faulty and can further corrupt the information contained in qubits. “The only way a quantum computer can work is if its ‘logical’ qubits are constantly monitored by ‘ancillary’ qubits, which ensure logical errors are detected and corrected before they can affect the computation,” said Yale postdoctoral associate Serge Rosenblum, co-lead author of a new study published in the journal Science. Ancillary qubits have already been shown to correct logical errors, but their use so far has been limited because errors in the ancillary qubits can “leak” to the logical qubits, thereby introducing more errors than they’re able to fix."</em> <a href="https://news.yale.edu/2018/07/24/fault-tolerant-system-stopping-leaks-quantum-computers">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Discovery may lead to more robust computer hard discs, TAU and Tsinghua University researchers say Lubricity measures the reduction in mechanical friction and wear by a lubricant. These are the main causes of component failure and energy loss in mechanical and electromechanical systems. For example, one-third of the fuel-based energy in vehicles is expended in overcoming friction. So superlubricity — the state of ultra-low friction and wear — holds great promise for the reduction of frictional wear in mechanical and automatic devices. A new joint Tel Aviv University/Tsinghua University study finds that robust structural superlubricity can be achieved between dissimilar, microscale-layered materials under high external loads and ambient conditions. The researchers found that microscale interfaces between graphite and hexagonal boron nitride exhibit ultra-low friction and wear."</em> <a href="https://www.aftau.org/news-page-computers--technology?&amp;storyid4702=2404&amp;ncs4702=3">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Soft grippers can be 3D printed on board ships to safely sample different types of sea life The deep ocean – dark, cold, under high pressure, and airless – is notoriously inhospitable to humans, yet it teems with organisms that manage to thrive in its harsh environment. Studying those creatures requires specialized equipment mounted on remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) that can withstand those conditions in order to collect samples. This equipment, designed primarily for the underwater oil and mining industries, is clunky, expensive, and difficult to maneuver with the kind of control needed for interacting with delicate sea life. Picking a delicate sea slug off the ocean floor with these tools is akin to trying to pluck a grape using pruning shears. Now, a multidisciplinary group of engineers, marine biologists, and roboticists has developed an alternative sampling device that is soft, flexible, and customizable, allowing scientists to gently grab different types of organisms from the sea without damaging them, and 3D-print modifications to the device overnight without the need to return to a land-based laboratory.

<p><em>"A material already known for its unique behavior is found to carry current in a way never before observed Scientists at the Florida State University-headquartered National High Magnetic Field Laboratory have discovered a behavior in materials called cuprates that suggests they carry current in a way entirely different from conventional metals such as copper. The research, published today in the journal Science, adds new meaning to the materials’ moniker, “strange metals.” Cuprates are high-temperature superconductors (HTS), meaning they can carry current without any loss of energy at somewhat warmer temperatures than conventional, low-temperature superconductors (LTS). Although scientists understand the physics of LTS, they haven’t yet cracked the nut of HTS materials. Exactly how the electrons travel through these materials remains the biggest mystery in the field. For their research on one specific cuprate, lanthanum strontium copper oxide (LSCO), a team led by MagLab physicist Arkady Shekhter focused on its normal, metallic state — the state from which superconductivity eventually emerges when the temperature dips low enough. This normal state of cuprates is known as a “strange” or “bad” metal, in part because the electrons don’t conduct electricity particularly well."</em> <a href="https://news.fsu.edu/news/science-technology/2018/08/02/strange-metals-just-got-stranger/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"I have, for as long as I can remember been obsessed by LEDs and time. In this project I have created a large wall clock that displays the current time using 132 neopixel LEDs mounted and shining through a spruce board. Its a hybrid analog digital with an Individual  pixel for each hour, minute and second. This was the largest project I have taken on to date, I started thinking about it 6 months ago and the idea slowly came together. I am really happy with the outcome and I'm looking forward to sharing it with you. "</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/132-Pixel-Clock/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Ever since I first saw the LED filament light-bulbs I have been thinking that the filaments must be good for something, but it took until the closing-down sale of a local electronics part shop for me to buy some bulbs with the intention to smash them and see what I could do with the filaments. It didn't take long to decide that they would make an interesting clock, and that it would be a lot of fun to float the segments in the air suspended only by their power wires. Part way through building it I realised that it was oddly reminiscent of the cobwebs with writing in from the book "Charlotte's Web" Bear in mind that this device has 80V on the bare metal frame. But using an isolating DC-to-DC converter and power supply means that it is possible to touch the frame and not get a shock. Or at least I haven't.

<p><em>"When Adafruit first introduced the 60 element Neo-Pixel ring in March 2004, the obvious choice for a project was to build a clock. By selectively lighting certain pixels around the ring you can depict analog time in a digital manner. Because the SAMD21 processor used in a Feather M0 boards has a built-in real-time clock, it's easy to keep track of time once you start the clock. The "RTC_Zero" library provided by Arduino.cc makes it easy to set and read the time using this built-in real-time clock hardware. We give you a variety of ways to set the time and control various options on the clock. The simplest method is a set of 4 touch control pads using the Adafruit_FreeTouch library."</em> <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/talking-musical-neo-pixel-clock-with-infrared-ble-and-touch-controls?view=all">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Part one of a project that will demonstrate the building of an FPGA/SoC-based hexapod robot. Story Introduction One of the projects I am working on at the moment is an FPGA / SoC-controlled hexapod robot which is capable of walking and navigating around obstacles in its environment. To navigate the robot will need to be able to detect the distance to objects. There are two ways this can be achieved: using stereoscopic cameras or an active sensor such as a ultrasonic range finder. Ultrasonic range finders work by generating a high frequency signal, and then measuring the time of flight of the reflected signal to determine the distance to an object. My plan for the hexpod robot is to use a Cora Z7 board to implement the motor control, navigation system, and user interface."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/adam-taylor/building-a-hexapod-robot-sonar-measurement-with-fpga-dc0e47">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Have you ever wondered what it takes to build a rover like NASA’s Curiosity rover, part of the Mars Science Laboratory project? One would rightfully assume it takes expertise in mechanical engineering, software development, and electronics to even begin to construct such a complex robot. Now students, hobbyists, and enthusiasts can learn about these skills and get a taste of what it is like to construct such a rover using plans and instructions from JPL’s Open Source Rover Project. After the successful landing of Curiosity on Mars, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California built a smaller educational model of the rover (called “ROV-E”) which was used as an education tool for high school and university students, as well as the general public. It was a rover that could be brought into classrooms, museums, and school events to demonstrate robotic principles first-hand. The response to this rover was very positive and often included the question “How can we build one of our own?”."</em> <a href="https://scienceandtechnology.jpl.nasa.gov/build-your-own-rover">[...]</a>
