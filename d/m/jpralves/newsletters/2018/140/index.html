<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1737, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis-Bernard_Guyton_de_Morveau">Louis-Bernard Guyton de Moréveau</a>. Este Químico francês colaborou com Antoine Lavoisier e outros para estabelecer uma nomenclatura química sistemática, ajudando a distinguir elementos de compostos. Ele publicou estudos sobre flogisto e cristalização, e também gás amónia liquidificado. Ele escreveu a secção química da Encyclopédie méthodique (Vol. I, 1786). Em 1761, Guyton propôs que o nome "alumina" (daí alumínio) fosse usado para a base em alúmen (sulfato de alumínio e potássio, alenismo latino = alum). Guyton foi um dos primeiros a concluir que o ferro e o aço diferem unicamente do seu conteúdo de carbono, melhorou o fabrico de pólvora, foi o primeiro a usar cloro e gás ácido clorídrico como desinfectantes e foi um dos primeiros baloonistas (1784).</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1809, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Braille">Louis Braille</a>. Este educador francês desenvolveu uma forma táctil de impressão e escrita, conhecida como braille, que desde então foi amplamente adoptada pelos cegos. Ele próprio ficou cego aos quatro anos, depois de um acidente enquanto tocava com um taco. Em 1821, enquanto Braille estava numa escola para cegos, um soldado chamado Charles Barbier visitou-o e mostrou um sistema de código que ele havia inventado. O sistema, chamado de "escrita nocturna", tinha sido criado para os soldados a partir das trincheiras de guerra poderem passar silenciosamente instruções usando combinações de doze pontos levantados. O jovem Braille percebeu o quão útil seria este sistema de pontos levantados. Ele desenvolveu um esquema mais simples usando apenas seis pontos. Em 1827, o primeiro livro em braille foi publicado. Agora, os cegos também podem escrever para si mesmos usando uma caneta simples para fazer os pontos.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1846, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Hibberd_Johnson">Edward Hibberd Johnson</a>. Este engenheiro electrotécnico e inventor Norte-americano passou muitos anos a trabalhar em vários projetos de negócios com Thomas Edison, inclusive como vice-presidente da Edison Electric Light Company. Eles conheceram-se quando Johnson, como gerente da Automatic Telegraph Company, contratou Thomas Edison, na altura com 24 anos. Como o talento de Edison como inventor o impulsionou a desenvolver seu laboratório de invenção e empresas comerciais, Johnson tornou-se o seu executivo de negócios e, eventualmente, presidente da Edison Electric Illuminating Co. de Nova York. Johnson ficou conhecido por ter criado as primeiras luzes eléctricas numa árvore de Natal em 22 de Dezembro de 1882, que ele as exibiu na janela de sua casa em Nova York. O fio de lâmpadas feitas à mão tinha sido feito para ele, com 80 lâmpadas do tamanho de uma noz brilhando em números iguais de luz vermelha, branca e azul.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1940, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Josephson">Brian Josephson</a>. Este físico Galês descobriu o efeito Josephson (1962) - um fluxo de corrente eléctrica como pares de electrões, chamado Cooper Pairs, entre dois materiais super-condutores que são separados por um isolador extremamente fino. Este arranjo é chamado de "Josephson Junction". Foi-lhe atribuído o Prémio Nobel de Física de 1973 (com Leo Esaki e Ivar Giaever).</p>

<p>Na semana que passou ficámos a saber que grande parte dos processadores modernos da Intel, AMD e ARM sofrem de uma falha no seu desenho que, não podendo ser corrigida exclusivamente por um "patch" no micro-código, irá obrigar ao redesenho dos Kernels Linux e do Windows para impedir a utilização deste bug de segurança. Desde Novembro - momento em que um grupo restrito de investigadores descobriu o problema que estão a trabalhar nos mecanismos de mitigação do mesmo. O problema reside na possibilidade de uma aplicação maliciosa executada em "user-space" poder ler a memória supostamente protegida do Kernel assim como, em ambientes de virtualização (onde se supõe haver uma "sandbox" entre as várias máquinas virtuais), poder ler a memória do hipervisor e de outras máquinas virtuais. Para resolver o problema, serão necessárias actualizações para o Kernel e para o micro-código do processador.
O problema desde que foi anunciado já escalou e actualmente não tem um mas dois nomes código distintos que são o Meltdown e o Spectre. O Meltdown é o problema exclusivo dos processadores Intel. O Spectre é o problema que se estende a todos os fabricantes. A existência destes bugs tem a ver com a forma como os processadores actuais lidam com a elevada performance e com uma técnica usada, designada por <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative_execution">execução especulativa</a> que se traduz numa técnica de optimização da capacidade de execução do processador. Infelizmente esta técnica não entra em linha de conta com os domínio de protecção e pode permitir acessos indevidos.
A resolução deste problema ao nível dos Kernels dos sistemas operativos irá provavelmente implicar uma redução de performance que poderá chegar aos 30% em algum tipo de "Workloads".</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como um modelo 3D. São apresentados cinco livros sobre Linux, um sobre Administração, outro sobre Servidores, outro sobre Redes, outros sobre "Storage" e por fim um sobre Segurança.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/01/02/intel_cpu_design_flaw/">'Kernel memory leaking' Intel processor design flaw forces Linux, Windows redesign</a></h2>

<p><em>"A fundamental design flaw in Intel's processor chips has forced a significant redesign of the Linux and Windows kernels to defang the chip-level security bug. Programmers are scrambling to overhaul the open-source Linux kernel's virtual memory system. Meanwhile, Microsoft is expected to publicly introduce the necessary changes to its Windows operating system in an upcoming Patch Tuesday: these changes were seeded to beta testers running fast-ring Windows Insider builds in November and December. Crucially, these updates to both Linux and Windows will incur a performance hit on Intel products. The effects are still being benchmarked, however we're looking at a ballpark figure of five to 30 per cent slow down, depending on the task and the processor model. More recent Intel chips have features – specifically, PCID – to reduce the performance hit."</em> <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/01/02/intel_cpu_design_flaw/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"An easy and reliable assembly approach, inspired by building blocks, challenges the current fabrication of electronic systems. A strategy for assembly of electronic systems—especially the flexible structures needed for high-performance devices of the future—uses integrated circuits as Lego-like building blocks. “This plug-and-play approach is absolutely disruptive,” says PhD candidate Sohail Shaikh from KAUST: this unique method of assembly creates completely new options for manufacturing processes of these systems. Existing technologies for building electronic devices, such as computers, smartphones and robots, rely on complex automated manufacturing processes. These involve high-precision equipment to align and package thousands of components that range from a few millimeters upward in size. Once aligned, these components are connected to printed circuit boards using numerous tiny pins."</em> <a href="https://discovery.kaust.edu.sa/en/article/458/carving-out-circuits-that-click-into-place">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.spring8.or.jp/en/news_publications/press_release/2017/171221/">Viewing atomic structures of dopant atoms in 3D relating to electrical activity in a semiconductor</a></h2>

<p><em>"Scientists at Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech) and their research team involving researchers of JASRI, Osaka University, Nagoya Institute of Technology, and Nara Institute of Science and Technology have just developed a novel approach to determine and visualize the three-dimensional (3D) structure of individual dopant atoms using SPring-8. The technique will help improve the current understanding of the atomic structures of dopants in semiconductors correlated with their electrical activity and thus help support the development of new manufacturing processes for high-performance devices. Using a combination of spectro-photoelectron holography, electrical property measurements, and first-principles dynamics simulations, the 3D atomic structures of dopant impurities in a semiconductor crystal were successfully revealed. The need for a better understanding of the atomic structures of dopants in semiconductors had been long felt, mainly because the current limitations on active dopant concentrations result from the deactivation of excess dopant atoms by the formation of various types of clusters and other defect structures. The search for techniques to electrically activate the dopant impurities in semiconductors with high efficiency and/or at high concentrations have always been an essential aspect of semiconductor device technology. However, despite various successful developments, the achievable maximum concentration of active dopants remains limited."</em> <a href="http://www.spring8.or.jp/en/news_publications/press_release/2017/171221/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Discovery could improve microelectronics and optical communication MINNEAPOLIS / ST. PAUL (12/19/2017) — Light can generate an electrical current in semiconductor materials. This is how solar cells generate electricity from sunlight and how smart phone cameras can take photographs. To collect the generated electrical current, called photocurrent, an electric voltage is needed to force the current to flow in only one direction. In new research, scientists at the University of Minnesota used a first-of-its-kind device to demonstrate a way to control the direction of the photocurrent without deploying an electric voltage. The new study was recently published in the scientific journal Nature Communications. The study reveals that control is effected by the direction in which the particles of light, called photons, are spinning—clockwise or counterclockwise."</em> <a href="https://cse.umn.edu/news-release/researchers-steer-flow-electrical-current-spinning-light/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Just as magnets attract iron particles in sandpits, permanent magnetics only attract one type of ion in an electrochemical solution, constituting the basis of magnetically controlled electrochemical transistors. Electrochemical devices find application in many technologies, including batteries, capacitors, sensors, and transistors. For such electrochemical devices to operate, they need an electric field that causes ionic transport and electrochemical processes. This simple but strict rule has long hindered innovation in electrochemistry and related technologies, however, WPI-MANA researchers recently challenged the rule with their development of ‘magnetic control of electrochemical devices’. WPI-MANA researchers Takashi Tsuchiya and Kazuya Terabe and their co-workers used a small magnet, instead of electrical equipment, to drive ions. The transport of paramagnetic FeCl4 ions in a liquid electrolyte (including [Bmim]FeCl4) was magnetically controlled to operate a typical electrochemical device; an Electric Double Layer Transistor (EDLT), a type of transistor that uses an EDL at a semiconductor/electrolyte interface to tune the electronic carrier density of the semiconductor."</em> <a href="http://www.nims.go.jp/mana/jp/research/highlights/vol33.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In an effort to block emerging threats to online security, researchers at Princeton University have developed a method to verify the strength of random number generators that form the basis of most encryption systems. Nearly all secure online traffic — from shopping to banking to communications — relies on a technique of randomly generating a number that serves as a key to unlock encrypted communication. The problem is that small programming errors can make these systems vulnerable, and those vulnerabilities can often be very difficult to detect. “Whenever you connect up to Amazon to give them your credit card number, whenever you log in somewhere through a secure connection, you’re depending on randomly generated cryptographic keys,” said Andrew Appel, the Eugene Higgins Professor of Computer Science at Princeton and leader of the research team. “And if the adversary, the spy who is trying to read your messages or impersonate you, could guess what random number your computer was using, then it could know what key you’re going to be using and it could impersonate your traffic and read your messages.” In a paper presented to the Association for Computing Machinery 2017 Conference on Computer and Communications Security on Nov. 2, the researchers said it may be impossible to tell whether a number generator is compromised without examining the generators’ source code (and without proper methods, difficult to guarantee security even with access to the code). The programs, called Deterministic Random Bit Generators or DRBGs, are tested typically by analyzing their outputs, either statistically or by using a set of tests to check the results."</em> <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/news/2017/12/21/proof-randomness-builds-future-digital-security">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers from the University of Cambridge have taken a peek into the secretive domain of quantum mechanics. In a theoretical paper published in the journal Physical Review A, they have shown that the way that particles interact with their environment can be used to track quantum particles when they’re not being observed, which had been thought to be impossible. One of the fundamental ideas of quantum theory is that quantum objects can exist both as a wave and as a particle, and that they don’t exist as one or the other until they are measured. This is the premise that Erwin Schrödinger was illustrating with his famous thought experiment involving a dead-or-maybe-not-dead cat in a box. “This premise, commonly referred to as the wave function, has been used more as a mathematical tool than a representation of actual quantum particles,” said David Arvidsson-Shukur, a PhD student at Cambridge’s Cavendish Laboratory, and the paper’s first author. “That’s why we took on the challenge of creating a way to track the secret movements of quantum particles.” Any particle will always interact with its environment, ‘tagging’ it along the way."</em> <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/researchers-chart-the-secret-movement-of-quantum-particles">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Solar and renewable energy is getting hot, thanks to nanoscientists — those who work with materials smaller than the width of a human hair — at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory who have discovered new, better and faster ways to convert energy from light into energetic electrons. Their innovative methods could provide new opportunities and greater efficiencies for solar energy conversion applications. Argonne scientists and their collaborators created hybrid nanomaterials — measured in billionths of a meter — at the laboratory’s Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM), a DOE Office of Science User Facility, to harness the full energy of photons. The result was energetic, or “hot,” electrons, which carry the same amount of energy as a photon that strikes nanomaterial components. These little dynamos could eventually lead to big advances in photocatalytic water splitting — in which special materials convert solar energy into clean and renewable hydrogen fuel — and photovoltaics, which convert solar energy into electricity. The research team focused on metals and metal nanostructures because they absorb a great deal of light, which is the first step to increasing the number of energetic electrons in an illuminated material."</em> <a href="http://www.anl.gov/articles/hot-electrons-heat-solar-energy-research">[...]</a>

That work was envisioned as the first step toward a system that can originate recipes for materials that have been described only theoretically. Now, in a paper in the journal npj Computational Materials, the same three materials scientists, with a colleague in MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), take a further step in that direction, with a new artificial-intelligence system that can recognize higher-level patterns that are consistent across recipes. For instance, the new system was able to identify correlations between “precursor” chemicals used in materials recipes and the crystal structures of the resulting products. The same correlations, it turned out, had been documented in the literature. The system also relies on statistical methods that provide a natural mechanism for generating original recipes."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/machine-learning-system-synthesizes-new-materials-recipes-1221">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Astronomers find close correlation between the mass of a galaxy's central black hole and its star formation history Young galaxies blaze with bright new stars forming at a rapid rate, but star formation eventually shuts down as a galaxy evolves. A new study, published January 1, 2018, in Nature, shows that the mass of the black hole in the center of the galaxy determines how soon this "quenching" of star formation occurs. Every massive galaxy has a central supermassive black hole, more than a million times more massive than the sun, revealing its presence through its gravitational effects on the galaxy's stars and sometimes powering the energetic radiation from an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The energy pouring into a galaxy from an active galactic nucleus is thought to turn off star formation by heating and dispelling the gas that would otherwise condense into stars as it cooled. This idea has been around for decades, and astrophysicists have found that simulations of galaxy evolution must incorporate feedback from the black hole in order to reproduce the observed properties of galaxies. But observational evidence of a connection between supermassive black holes and star formation has been lacking, until now."</em> <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/01/supermassive-black-holes.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Engineered quantum dots could bring down the cost of solar electricity Using two types of “designer” quantum dots, researchers are creating double-pane solar windows that generate electricity with greater efficiency and create shading and insulation for good measure. It’s all made possible by a new window architecture which utilizes two different layers of low-cost quantum dots tuned to absorb different parts of the solar spectrum. “Because of the the strong performance we can achieve with low-cost, solution-processable materials, these quantum-dot-based double-pane windows and even more complex luminescent solar concentrators offer a new way to bring down the cost of solar electricity,” said lead researcher Victor Klimov. “The approach complements existing photovoltaic technology by adding high-efficiency sunlight collectors to existing solar panels or integrating them as semitransparent windows into a building’s architecture.” The key to this advance is “solar-spectrum splitting,” which allows one to process separately higher– and lower–energy solar photons. The higher-energy photons can generate a higher photovoltage, which could boost the overall power output. This approach also improves the photocurrent as the dots used in the front layer are virtually “reabsorption free.” To achieve this, the Los Alamos team incorporates into quantum dots ions of manganese that serve as highly emissive impurities."</em> <a href="http://www.lanl.gov/discover/news-release-archive/2018/January/0102-quantum-dots.php">[...]</a>

<p><em>"For the first time, physicists have built a two-dimensional experimental system that allows them to study the physical properties of materials that were theorized to exist only in four-dimensional space. An international team of researchers from Penn State, ETH Zurich in Switzerland, the University of Pittsburgh, and the Holon Institute of Technology in Israel have demonstrated that the behavior of particles of light can be made to match predictions about the four-dimensional version of the “quantum Hall effect” — a phenomenon that has been at the root of three Nobel Prizes in physics — in a two-dimensional array of “waveguides.” A paper describing the research appears Jan. 4 in the journal Nature, along with a paper from a separate group from Germany that shows that a similar mechanism can be used to make a gas of ultracold atoms exhibit four-dimensional quantum Hall physics as well. “When it was theorized that the quantum Hall effect could be observed in four-dimensional space,” said Mikael Rechtsman, assistant professor of physics and an author of the paper, “it was considered to be of purely theoretical interest because the real world consists of only three spatial dimensions; it was more or less a curiosity. But, we have now shown that four-dimensional quantum Hall physics can be emulated using photons — particles of light — flowing through an intricately structured piece of glass — a waveguide array.” When electric charge is sandwiched between two surfaces, the charge behaves effectively like a two-dimensional material. When that material is cooled down to near absolute-zero temperature and subjected to a strong magnetic field, the amount that it can conduct becomes “quantized” — fixed to a fundamental constant of nature, and cannot change. “Quantization is striking because even if the material is ‘messy’ — that is, it has a lot of defects — this ‘Hall conductance’ remains exceedingly stable,” said Rechtsman."</em> <a href="http://news.psu.edu/story/499446/2018/01/03/research/four-dimensional-physics-two-dimensions">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) researchers have discovered novel ways to extend the capabilities of two-photon lithography (TPL), a high-resolution 3D printing technique capable of producing nanoscale features smaller than one-hundredth the width of a human hair. The findings, recently published on the cover of the journal ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces (link is external), also unleashes the potential for X-ray computed tomography (CT) to analyze stress or defects noninvasively in embedded 3D-printed medical devices or implants. Two-photon lithography typically requires a thin glass slide, a lens and an immersion oil to help the laser light focus to a fine point where curing and printing occurs. It differs from other 3D-printing methods in resolution, because it can produce features smaller than the laser light spot, a scale no other printing process can match. The technique bypasses the usual diffraction limit of other methods because the photoresist material that cures and hardens to create structures — previously a trade secret — simultaneously absorbs two photons instead of one. In the paper, LLNL researchers describe cracking the code on resist materials optimized for two-photon lithography and forming 3D microstructures with features less than 150 nanometers."</em> <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/news/lab-unlocks-secrets-nanoscale-3d-printing">[...]</a>

<p><em>"We are a group of students of the ULB, Universit Libre de Bruxelles. Our project consists on the developing of a robot glove able to create a grip force helping people grabbing things. THE GLOVE The glove has a wire connection that links the fingers to some servo motors: a wire is attached to the extremity of the finger and to the servo, so when the servo turns, the wire is pulled and the finger is flexed. In this way, by controlling the grip done by the user through some pressure sensors in the extremity of the fingers, we are able to actuate the motors in a controlled way and help the gripping by bending the finger proportionally to the rotation of the motors and so to the rolling up of the wires. In this way we should be able either to allow weak people to grip objects or help even people in physiological conditions to grip objects and to keep it without any effort. THE DESIGN The model has been developed in order to make the hand movement as free as possible."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/RoboGlove/">[...]</a>

Why not use existing servo libraries for the Arduino? I use the Adafruit PWM Servo Driver to drive a bunch of servos, and this allows me to send a different PWM signal to each servo. I could use the Servo library which is built into my Arduino installation - but I've a few reasons for not doing this: With the Adafruit PWM Servo Driver, I can control my servos using just two pins over I2C, rather than having dedicate a pin on my Arduino to every servo. I've sometimes found with the Arduino Servo library that when I attach to a servo and send a signal for it to rotate to the zero degree position that it rotates to the limit of travel and grinds the gears inside the servo."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/jeremy-lindsay/calibrating-my-servos-fa27ce">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This project is an Electronic Travel Aid (ETA) that enables the user to navigate around objects in their path and view the profile of their surroundings. The device delivers spatial information about a small area in front of the user via haptic feedback: range information from time-of-flight (TOF) sensors is mapped to the vibration intensity of vibration motors against the user’s skin. This device is intended to be an Electronic Travel Aid (ETA) to assist in the mobility of a visually impaired pedestrian. The sensing module contains six time-of-flight distance sensors arranged horizontally at relative angles to measure distance from the user’s hand to six points along an arc in front of him or her. The sensing module is held in the user’s head. The total angular range across the distance sensor is about 25 degrees, which gives information across a spread of one meter at one meter of distance from the sensor module."</em> <a href="http://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/FinalProjects/f2017/ac923_kk938_neh54/ac923_kk938_neh54/ac923_kk938_neh54/FinalProjectReport.html">[...]</a>

Connecting it to a computer allows data to be plotted to make a simple sonar scanner. The scanning ability is made possible through the use of a hobby servo motor SG-5010, and an Adafruit motor shield v1.0. This project could easily be extended to provide object avoidance for any robotics project. This tutorial was designed so that you could see how the components interact, and also to see how you can use and expand the functionality of the motor shield."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Scan-Nearby-Objects-Using-ARDUINO/">[...]</a>

The original automation script is written in Python and uses a GMail connection to consult the commands, I had never used this programming language but the truth is not so different from the others, I have modified it a bit so that it adapts better to the new ones Python libraries and the automation process together with the operating system configurations allow you to parameterize the following: Interaction through commands sent to Chat controlled through ChatBots.It allows to track the status of the food dispensed.Controls how much food is going to be dispensed.It has buttons that allow you to feed manually.It does not allow overfeeding by disabling the feeding at 8-hour intervals.It has a status LCD that shows the data as the date and time of the next time for the next power supply, the SSID to which it is connected to the WiFi and the IP address of the device.Optional: Shows some Chuck Norris Random Jokes and / or Trivia of Numbers using a pair of public APIS (Ingenious by the original author).The System is immune to restarts due to power cuts as it saves a status file.The System Detects when there is a connection loss and tries to re-connect until it is successful.

With 2FA logins, not only is a username and password needed, but also a one-time-use code. There's a few different ways to get that code, such as by email, phone or SMS. But my favorite way is to do it is via a 'Google Authenticator' time-based OTP (one time password), also known as a TOTP. Using an app on your phone like Authy or Authenticator, you set up a secret given to you by the service, then every 30 seconds, a new code is generated for you."</em> <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-totp-otp-2fa-authy-authenticator-friend?view=all">[...]</a>
