<p>Faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1814, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Colt">Samuel Colt</a>. Este fabricante norte-americano de armas de fogo popularizou o revólver Colt 45 e outras armas de fogo. Enquanto marinheiro aprendiz, ele fez um modelo de madeira de uma pistola automática de revólver (talvez inspirada na roda do navio) e ao retornar aos EUA fez modelos de metal, pediu patentes e fez uma tornee como "Dr. Coult", ganhando assim o dinheiro que precisava para começar a fabricação. A sua fábrica foi uma das mais inovadoras no uso da técnica de produção em massa. O seu estilo de vendas e auto-promoção de Barnum também popularizou o seu produto.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1846, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Charles_Pickering">Edward Charles Pickering</a>. Nasceu em Boston, Massachusetts, este físico e astrónomo dos EUA. Depois de se formar em Harvard, leccionou física por dez anos no MIT, onde construiu o primeiro laboratório de física instrucional dos Estados Unidos. Aos 30 anos, ele dirigiu o Harvard College Observatory por 42 anos. As suas observações foram assistidas por uma equipa de mulheres, incluindo Annie Jump Cannon. Ele introduziu o uso do fotómetro meridiano para medir a magnitude das estrelas e estabeleceu a Harvard Photometry (1884), o primeiro grande catálogo fotométrico. Ao estabelecer uma estação no Peru (1891) para fazer as fotografias do sul, ele publicou o primeiro mapa fotográfico de todo o céu (1903).</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1865, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Friedel">Georges Friedel</a>. Este Cristalógrafo francês formulou leis básicas sobre a morfologia externa e estrutura interna dos cristais. Ele era o filho de Charles Friedel (1832-1899), mineralogista francês e químico orgânico. Ele reconheceu, em 1892, que os cristais líquidos tinham três tipos de organização (mesofases). Em 1893, tornou-se professor na Escola Nacional das Minas em Saint-Etienne.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou a Rolls-Royce revelou um conceito de veículo de descolagem e aterragem vertical (EVTOL) no Farnborough International Airshow 2018. O projecto pode ser adaptado para transporte pessoal, transporte público, logística e aplicações militares e é baseado sobre tecnologias que já existem ou estão actualmente em desenvolvimento. Pode levar para o céu logo no início dos anos 2020.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. É apresentada a revista hackspace nº9.</p>

<h2><a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-announces-industrys-first-8gb-lpddr5-dram-for-5g-and-ai-powered-mobile-applications">Samsung Electronics Announces Industry's First 8Gb LPDDR5 DRAM for 5G and AI-powered Mobile Applications</a></h2>

<p><em>"Samsung Electronics, the world leader in advanced memory technology, today announced that it has successfully developed the industry’s first 10-nanometer (nm) class* 8-gigabit (Gb) LPDDR5 DRAM. Since bringing the first 8Gb LPDDR4 to mass production in 2014, Samsung has been setting the stage to transition to the LPDDR5 standard for use in upcoming 5G and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered mobile applications. The newly-developed 8Gb LPDDR5 is the latest addition to Samsung’s premium DRAM lineup, which includes 10nm-class 16Gb GDDR6 DRAM (in volume production since December 2017) and 16Gb DDR5 DRAM (developed in February). “This development of 8Gb LPDDR5 represents a major step forward for low-power mobile memory solutions,” said Jinman Han, senior vice president of Memory Product Planning &amp; Application Engineering at Samsung Electronics. “We will continue to expand our next-generation 10nm-class DRAM lineup as we accelerate the move toward greater use of premium memory across the global landscape.” The 8Gb LPDDR5 boasts a data rate of up to 6,400 megabits per second (Mb/s), which is 1.5 times as fast as the mobile DRAM chips used in current flagship mobile devices (LPDDR4X, 4266Mb/s). With the increased transfer rate, the new LPDDR5 can send 51.2 gigabytes (GB) of data, or approximately 14 full-HD video files (3.7GB each), in a second."</em> <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-announces-industrys-first-8gb-lpddr5-dram-for-5g-and-ai-powered-mobile-applications">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.microchip.com/pressreleasepage/single-power-monitoring-ic-measures-from-0V-to-32V">Reduce Costs and Bill of Materials with Single Power Monitoring IC that Measures Power from 0V to 32V</a></h2>

<p><em>"Managing and reducing power consumption is crucial in low-voltage, high-power applications such as Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and embedded computing devices. These devices must first accurately measure power before they can manage it, but precision power measurement solutions are often costly and require multiple ICs or power configurations to measure different rails. To meet these needs, Microchip Technology Inc. (NASDAQ: MCHP) today introduced new two- and three-channel power monitoring devices that measure from 0V to 32V on a single chip, offering designers solutions that are easy to adopt and improve power measurement accuracy. The two-channel device is also the industry’s first with native 16-bit resolution, providing leading flexibility across a wide measurement range. The PAC1932/33 devices include precisely what is needed to measure power on a single Integrated Circuit (IC), integrating multiple channels in a single package for applications such as Point of Sale (POS) systems, ATMs and building automation. This reduces costs for system designers while also consolidating their Bill of Materials (BOM), as the measurement of sub 1V to 20V voltage rails normally require separate components to measure each rail efficiently."</em> <a href="https://www.microchip.com/pressreleasepage/single-power-monitoring-ic-measures-from-0V-to-32V">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Billions of objects ranging from smartphones and watches to buildings, machine parts and medical devices have become wireless sensors of their environments, expanding a network called the “Internet of Things.” As society moves toward connecting all objects to the internet — even furniture and office supplies — the technology that enables these objects to communicate and sense each other will need to scale up. Researchers at Purdue University and the University of Virginia have developed a new fabrication method that makes tiny, thin-film electronic circuits peelable from a surface. The technique not only eliminates several manufacturing steps and the associated costs, but also allows any object to sense its environment or be controlled through the application of a high-tech sticker. Eventually, these stickers could also facilitate wireless communication. The researchers demonstrate capabilities on various objects in a paper recently published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. “We could customize a sensor, stick it onto a drone, and send the drone to dangerous areas to detect gas leaks, for example," said Chi Hwan Lee, Purdue assistant professor of biomedical engineering and mechanical engineering."</em> <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/Engr/AboutUs/News/Spotlights/2018/electronic-stickers-to-streamline-large-scale-internet-of-things">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://news.nus.edu.sg/press-releases/quantum-spin-effects">A step closer to quantum computers: NUS researchers show how to directly observe quantum spin effects</a></h2>

<p><em>"Scientists at NUS have discovered a new way to closely look at the electronic quantum behaviour of materials, giving a deeper understanding of how they could be used for future quantum computing applications With companies like Google, Microsoft, and IBM all racing to create the world’s first practical quantum computer, scientists worldwide are exploring the potential materials that could be used to build them. Now, Associate Professor Yang Hyunsoo and his team from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the National University of Singapore (NUS) Faculty of Engineering have demonstrated a new method which could be used to bring quantum computing closer to reality. “The NUS team, together with our collaborators from Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey in the United States and RMIT University in Australia, showed a practical way to observe and examine the quantum effects of electrons in topological insulators and heavy metals which could later pave the way for the development of advanced quantum computing components and devices,” explained Assoc Prof Yang. The findings of the study were published in the scientific journal Nature Communications in June 2018. The advantage of quantum computers Quantum computers are still in the early stages of development but are already displaying computing speeds millions of times faster than traditional technologies. As such, it is predicted that when quantum computing becomes more readily available, it will be able to answer some of the world’s toughest questions in everything from finance to physics."</em> <a href="http://news.nus.edu.sg/press-releases/quantum-spin-effects">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers at TU Delft have developed a highly sensitive and versatile hydrogen sensor that works at room temperature. The sensor is made of a thin layer of a material called tungsten trioxide. Hydrogen has the potential to replace fossil fuels as the most important energy carrier in the near future. It has the highest energy per mass of any fuel and can be produced sustainably. However, it is also flammable, making sensors that can detect it an absolute necessity for the transition to a hydrogen economy. Various types of hydrogen sensors already exist, but most of these sensors require high temperatures in order to function."</em> <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/2018/tnw/a-hydrogen-sensor-that-works-at-room-temperature/">[...]</a>

A new method now allows electrical contact to be established with simple molecules on a conventional silicon chip. The technique promises to bring advances in sensor technology and medicine, as reported in the journal Nature by chemists from the University of Basel and researchers from IBM Research – Zurich in Rüschlikon. To further develop semiconductor technology, the field of molecular electronics is seeking to manufacture circuit components from individual molecules instead of silicon. Because of their unique electronic properties, molecules are suited to applications that cannot be implemented using conventional silicon technology. However, this requires reliable and inexpensive methods for creating electrical contacts at the two ends of a molecule."</em> <a href="https://www.unibas.ch/en/News-Events/News/Uni-Research/Electrical-contact-to-molecules-in-semiconductor-structures-established-for-the-first-time.html">[...]</a>

But a paper published in Nature overnight reveals how we can make electronic devices 10 times smaller, and use molecules to build electronic circuits instead. We’re reaching the limits of what we can do with conventional silicon semiconductors. In order for electronic components to continue getting smaller we need a new approach. Molecular electronics, which aims to use molecules to build electronic devices, could be the answer.

<h2><a href="https://www.osa.org/en-us/about_osa/newsroom/news_releases/2018/quantum_dot_white_leds_achieve_record_efficiency/">Quantum Dot White LEDs Achieve Record Efficiency</a></h2>

<p><em>"Researchers have demonstrated nanomaterial-based white-light-emitting diodes (LEDs) that exhibit a record luminous efficiency of 105 lumens per watt. Luminous efficiency is a measure of how well a light source uses power to generate light. With further development, the new LEDs could reach efficiencies over 200 lumens per watt, making them a promising energy-efficient lighting source for homes, offices and televisions. “Efficient LEDs have strong potential for saving energy and protecting the environment,” said research leader Sedat Nizamoglu, Koç University, Turkey. “Replacing conventional lighting sources with LEDs with an efficiency of 200 lumens per watt would decrease the global electricity consumed for lighting by more than half. That reduction is equal to the electricity created by 230 typical 500-megawatt coal plants and would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 200 million tons.” The researchers describe how they created the high-efficiency white LEDs in Optica, The Optical Society's journal for high impact research."</em> <a href="https://www.osa.org/en-us/about_osa/newsroom/news_releases/2018/quantum_dot_white_leds_achieve_record_efficiency/">[...]</a>

Research to develop paper electronics has accelerated in the last ten years. Besides its availability and low cost, paper offers an intriguing potential: simply folding it could switch circuits on and off or otherwise change their activity — a kind of electronic origami. But most efforts to fabricate electrodes onto paper with sufficient conductivity for practical use have employed expensive metals such as gold or silver as the conducting material, swamping the potential savings of paper as a substrate. This new technology uses the inexpensive element molybdenum as the source of the conducting metal. It is added to gelatin in solution and binds to carbon in the gelatin."</em> <a href="https://engineering.berkeley.edu/2018/06/berkeley-engineers-develop-origami-electronics-using-cheap-foldable-paper">[...]</a>

In it, Darwin writes: “Hardly any expressive movement is so general as the involuntary erection of the hairs, feathers and other dermal appendages … it is common throughout three of the great vertebrate classes.” Nearly 150 years later, the field of robotics is starting to draw inspiration from those words. “The aspect of touch has not been explored much in human-robot interaction, but I often thought that people and animals do have this change in their skin that expresses their internal state,” said Guy Hoffman, assistant professor and Mills Family Faculty Fellow in the Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE). Inspired by this idea, Hoffman and students in his Human-Robot Collaboration and Companionship Lab have developed a prototype of a robot that can express “emotions” through changes in its outer surface. Its skin covers a grid of texture units (TUs) whose shapes are controlled by fluidic actuators, based on a design developed in the lab of Hoffman’s MAE colleague Rob Shepherd.

They explored a new way to select and send light of a specific color using long silicon wires that are several hundred nanometers in diameter (about 1,000 times smaller than a human hair) and their work enabled a new type of nanoscale “light switch” that can turn on and off the transmission of one color of light over very long distances. The research paper, written by chemistry professor James Cahoon and graduate student Seokhyoung Kim at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, along with collaborators at Korea University, was published in the journal Nature Communications on July 17. Optical computing technology promises many benefits. Swapping electrons for light-based technology would mean that the computers of the future won’t overheat and will run much faster. “In the past there hasn’t been a controlled method for selectively sending light down nanoscale wires, so optical technology has either used much larger structures or wasted a lot of light in the process,” said James Cahoon, senior corresponding author and associate professor of chemistry in the College of Arts and Sciences at UNC-Chapel Hill."</em> <a href="https://college.unc.edu/2018/07/light/">[...]</a>

The result could be a decreased cost for discovering new molecules for drugs, new chemical products including materials, polymers, and molecules for high tech applications like imaging. The team demonstrated the system’s potential by searching around 1000 reactions using combinations of 18 different starting chemicals.

He developed and improved strobes and used them to freeze objects in motion so that they could be captured on film by a camera. The 'Piddler' machine he created more than 50 years ago uses a stroboscopic technique to form optical illusions of levitating water droplets, slowing the downward flow of water as well as reversing the flow of water to move upwards to defy the laws of gravity. This inspired us to come up with our design of a Time Fountain. With the water droplets in reverse, moving against gravity, it looks like the fountain is going back in time. Hence it is coined as a 'Time Fountain'."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/JF-Time-Fountain/">[...]</a>

In this article I am writing a simple guide on how to build a smart IoT plant that would send sensor data to Azure IoT Hub and storing over Azure SQL via Azure functions, at the same time both auto and remotely control water for the plant. Helium IoT Hub connects to Azure IoT Hub in a seamless fashion, in this article we will explain how the entire process works. Since the entire project is serverless, the only code needed for the entire process to work is just Azure Function and Arduino code. Step 1: Gather Components We are building a simple product using Arduino UNO SEEED Grove Base shield Helium Atom + Helium Element with Helium Arduino Breakout board A pump Temperature/Humidity sensor, Moisture Sensor, UV Light Sensor Grove OLED Display"</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/Nyceane/smart-plant-iot-59cbc3">[...]</a>

<p><em>"So I built this project to see the 12 LED Pixel working. I found this one with 16 here. And I saw this integrated bracelet , but I wanted to see how different rings, different sizes would work independent from eachother. So instead of connecting Digital Output from one board into the Digital Input on the other board as the second picture suggests, my goal was to have one dedicated DI on each board.

<p><em>"Summer is in full swing in Oklahoma and the kids, grandkids, nieces, nephews and, well, just about everyone we know is in Lake Zumwalt to cool down. My wife has purchased enough pool toys to fill Lake Zumwalt, so I figured I would join the pool toy fray with WiFi Paddle Boat. WiFi Paddle Boat is a paddle boat controlled via wifi using a smart phone, tablet or other touch enabled device. WiFi Paddle Boat creates a wifi access point (much like the small sport cameras) that you connect to via your wifi enabled device wifi settings. Then, using your wifi touch enabled device web browser, you simply navigate to the WiFi Paddle Boat web page and off you go! The controls for WiFi Paddle Boat are identical to those of my "Lady Buggy" and "Santa Sleigh" designs so it's easy for the grandkids to operate."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/WiFi-Paddle-Boat/">[...]</a>
