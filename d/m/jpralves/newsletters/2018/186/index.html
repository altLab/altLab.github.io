<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1904, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_N%C3%A9el">Louis Néel</a>. Este físico francês  partilhou (com o astrofísico sueco Hannes Alfvén) o Prémio Nobel de Física em 1970 pelos seus estudos pioneiros sobre as propriedades magnéticas dos sólidos. As suas contribuições para a física de estado sólido encontraram inúmeras aplicações úteis, particularmente no desenvolvimento de unidades melhoradas das memórias de computador. Por volta de 1930 ele sugeriu que uma nova forma de comportamento magnético poderia existir - chamada anti-ferromagnetismo. Acima de uma certa temperatura (a temperatura de Néel) este comportamento pára. Néel apontou (1947) que os materiais também poderiam existir mostrando o ferrimagnetismo. Néel também deu uma explicação do fraco magnetismo de certas rochas, tornando possível o estudo da história passada do campo magnético da Terra.</p>

<p>Esta semana ficámos a saber que algumas das unidades com as quais lidamos quase todos os dias vão passar a ter uma definição de padrão diferente. À medida que a ciência avança, medições cada vez mais precisas são necessárias e possíveis. Mas esta melhoria de precisão deve acontecer por meio de padrões de medição e suas definições. Em Novembro de 2018, na Conferência Geral sobre Pesos e Medidas, a comunidade global de metrologia concordou com uma revisão do SI. A decisão significa que, pela primeira vez, todas as sete unidades básicas serão definidas em termos de constantes da natureza - como a velocidade da luz, a constante de Planck e a constante de Avogadro. Usar sete constantes definidoras como base para o SI significa que as definições de todas as unidades básicas permanecerão estáveis no futuro. A revisão trará novas definições do ampere, quilograma, kelvin (e, consequentemente, grau Celsius) e mole. Embora estas mudanças não sejam sentidas na vida quotidiana, elas representam uma profunda mudança de perspectiva. A partir de maio de 2019, todas as unidades de base do SI serão definidas em termos de constantes da natureza - as quantidades mais estáveis que já encontramos. O quilograma - será definido em termos da constante de Planck (h). O ampere - será definido em termos de carga elementar (e). O kelvin - será definido em termos da constante de Boltzmann (k). O mole - será definido em termos da constante de Avogadro (NA).</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como um modelo 3D que poderá ser útil. É apresentada a revista newelectronics de 13 de Novembro de 2018.</p>

<p><em>"As science advances, ever more accurate measurements are both needed and achievable. But this improving accuracy must happen through measurement standards and their definitions. In November 2018, at the General Conference on Weights and Measures, the global metrology community agreed a revision to the SI. The decision means that, for the first time, all seven of the base units will be defined in terms of constants of nature – such as the speed of light, the Planck constant and the Avogadro constant. Using seven defining constants as the basis for the SI will mean that the definitions of all the base units will stay stable into the future. The revision will bring in new definitions of the ampere, kilogram, kelvin (and, consequently, degree Celsius) and mole."</em> <a href="http://www.npl.co.uk/si-units/redefining-the-si-units/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"HRE Wheels and GE Additive announced a partnership agreement today and unveiled the first titanium wheel created using EBM technology (a type of 3D printing). Known as “HRE3D+”, this new prototype wheel shows what the future of wheel technology will bring and how advanced materials like titanium can be harnessed to create complex designs. The goal of the “HRE3D+” project was to test the capabilities of additive manufacturing in a practical application and to create a highly-sophisticated wheel design with an elusive material like titanium. With a traditional aluminum Monoblok wheel, 80% of material is removed from a 100-pound forged block of aluminum to create the final product. With additive manufacturing, only 5% of the material is removed and recycled, making the process far more efficient. Titanium also has a much higher specific strength than aluminum and is corrosion resistant, allowing it to be extremely lightweight and to be shown in its raw finish."</em> <a href="https://www.hrewheels.com/news/hre-wheels-partners-with-ge-additive-to-create-first-3d-printed-titanium-wheel">[...]</a>

That’s six times hotter than the center of the sun. The device, the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST), is built to harness the energy of nuclear fusion, the same process that powers stars. Most living things depend on nuclear fusion. If the sun stopped working, so would we.

<p><em>"In a recent paper published on Journal of Neural Engineering, researchers at the University of Twente (NL), in cooperation with Imperial College London (UK) and University of Aalborg (DK) have presented a radically new technology that enables upper-limb amputees to control robotic prostheses as a natural extension of the own body. The technology is based on the concept of musculoskeletal modelling and represents an alternative to widely used machine learning methods. There are millions of people around the world that lost some part of their body as a result of amputation. Engineering solutions have the potential for immediate and sometimes dramatic restoration of the lost motor skills. However, despite advances, current prosthetic limbs provide limited functionality. Movement in able-bodied individuals begins with electrical impulses sent by the brain that trigger muscles into action."</em> <a href="https://www.utwente.nl/en/news/!/2018/11/146781/new-prosthetic-technology-lets-you-control-artificial-arms-as-your-own-biological-limb">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Dramatically longer-lasting, faster-charging and safer lithium metal batteries may be possible, according to Penn State research, recently published in Nature Energy. The researchers developed a three-dimensional, cross-linked polymer sponge that attaches to the metal plating of a battery anode. "This project aims to develop the next generation of metal batteries," said Donghai Wang, professor of mechanical engineering and the principal investigator of the project. "Lithium metal has been tried in batteries for decades, but there are some fundamental issues that inhibit their advancement." Under additional strain, like in the fast-charging methods desired in electrical vehicles, lithium ion (Li) batteries are vulnerable to dendritic growth — needle-like formations that can reduce cycle life and potentially cause safety issues — including fires or explosions. "Our approach was to use a polymer on the interface of Li metal," Wang explained."</em> <a href="https://news.psu.edu/story/547999/2018/11/14/research/next-gen-batteries-possible-new-engineering-approach">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Touch, or tactile sensing, is fundamentally important for a range of real-life applications, from robotics to surgical medicine to sports science. Tactile sensors are modeled on the biological sense of touch and can help researchers to understand human perception and motion. Researchers from Osaka University have now developed a new approach to pressure distribution measurement using tactile imaging technology. Pressure is one of the primary characteristics of touch, and tactile imaging can be used to measure pressure or stress distributions across an object of interest. The most common current approach to tactile imaging involves use of an array of sensors composed of pressure-sensitive materials. However, such arrays require complex fabrication processes and place limitations on the sensor design, hence the necessity of a new method, now outlined in an article in IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics."</em> <a href="https://resou.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/research/2018/20181114_2">[...]</a>

<p><em>"HZDR researchers use sensors to give humans magnetoception While birds are able to naturally perceive the Earth’s magnetic field and use it for orientation, humans have so far not come close to replicate this feat – at least, until now. Researchers at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR) in Germany have developed an electronic skin (e-skin) with magnetosensitive capabilities, sensitive enough to detect and digitize body motion in the Earth’s magnetic field. As this e-skin is extremely thin and malleable, it can easily be affixed to human skin to create a bionic analog of a compass. This might not only help people with orientation issues, but also facilitate interaction with objects in virtual and augmented reality. The results have been published in the journal Nature Electronics (DOI: 10.1038/s41928-018-0161-6).

<p><em>"Researchers have uncovered a new material that can produce both magnetism and superconductivity. In the physical world, one of the most incontrovertible truths is that magnetism and superconductivity are usually incompatible. Like two battalions of soldiers fighting over the same territory, when a material makes the transition from a normal to a superconducting state, it actively ​“kicks out” the magnetic fields from its interior; this is known as the Meissner effect. However, scientists have identified a few materials in which the two battalions can peacefully coexist, producing both magnetism and superconductivity. Research conducted in part at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory has identified another material that can produce both magnetism and superconductivity: ytterbium. This finding is important because it potentially brings scientists a step closer in their search for a superconductor that can operate at room temperature, opening up myriad new applications."</em> <a href="https://www.anl.gov/article/under-pressure-opposites-attract">[...]</a>

<p><em>"At the Materials Day Symposium, researchers focus on tools that probe atomic structures in action to yield better designs for metals, solar cells, and polymers. The 2018 MIT Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) Materials Day Symposium, highlighting advances in materials science and engineering, took place in Kresge Auditorium on Oct. 10. Among the latest advances shared: Powerful new combinations of X-rays, electrical probes, and analytical computing that are yielding insights into problems as diverse as fatigue in steel and stability in solar cells. “Fatigue in steel is a major issue; you don’t see any changes in the shape of your material, and suddenly it fails," MIT Assistant Professor C. Cem Taşan said at the event. “We are putting a lot of effort in maintenance and safety, yet still we have devastating accidents,” he said, recalling the airline incident in April 2018 when a jet engine turbine blade broke apart and shrapnel from the engine broke a plane window fatally injuring a passenger. “The airline company basically said that component passed all the maintenance requirements."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2018/improving-materials-at-nanoscale-materials-day-symposium-1108">[...]</a>

One promising avenue is converting simple chemicals into valuable ones using renewable electricity, including processes such as carbon dioxide reduction or water splitting.

Zack Ulissi, an assistant professor of chemical engineering, and his group are using machine learning to guide electrocatalyst discovery. By hand, researchers spend hours doing routine calculations on materials that may not end up working.

That means damage in carbon fiber composite structures can remain hidden below the surface, undetectable by visual inspection, potentially leading to catastrophic failure. “Carbon fiber composites fail catastrophically, so you won’t see damage until the entire structure has failed,” said Chris Bowland, a Wigner Fellow at the Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory. “By knowing what’s going on within the composite, you can better judge its health and know if there is damage that needs to be repaired.” Recently, Bowland and Amit Naskar, leader of ORNL’s Carbon and Composites Group, invented a roll-to-roll process to coat electrically conductive carbon fibers with semiconducting silicon carbide nanoparticles."</em> <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/news/self-sensing-materials-are-here">[...]</a>

The result was achieved with photonic crystals built on the concept of topological insulators, which won its discoverers a Nobel Prize in 2016. By carefully controlling the geometry of a crystal lattice, researchers can block light from traveling through its interior while transmitting it perfectly along its surface. The device accomplishes its near-perfect transmittance around corners despite being much smaller than previous designs.

The first “biological-inorganic hybrid systems” (biohybrids) mostly focused on the fixation of atmospheric carbon dioxide and the production of alternative energies, and although promising, they also revealed key challenges. For example, semiconductors, which are made from toxic metals, thus far are assembled directly on bacterial cells and often harm them in the process. In addition, the initial focus on carbon-fixing microbes has limited the range of products to relatively simple molecules; if biohybrids could be created based on microorganisms equipped with more complex metabolisms, it would open new paths for the production of a much larger range of chemicals useful for many applications.

One surprising way that engineers are tackling this problem is by switching from normally straight trusses to ones with bumps, waves, and other irregular features. “Diameter variations allow for local thickening where the highest buckling moments occur, while reducing thickness in other areas along the trusses,” explains Stefanie Feih from the Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology (SIMTech) at A*STAR."</em> <a href="https://research.a-star.edu.sg/research/7930/building-a-new-wave-of-lightweight-structural-panels">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A strategy for stabilizing silver films could make high-efficiency fuel cells usable in portable devices Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) offer a stable and efficient way to generate clean electrochemical power, but are impractical for use in portable devices because of their high operating temperatures. A new design and production strategy developed by Florencia Edith Wiria of the A*STAR Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology and Pei-Chen Su at Nanyang Technological University could help propel SOFCs into mainstream use1. Micro-scale SOFCs could transform consumer electronics, delivering more power than existing batteries in an environmentally-friendly way. Silver is an appealing and affordable alternative to the costly platinum cathodes employed in current micro-SOFC designs. But silver electrodes melt, so they cannot retain the fine porous structure required for an efficient electrochemical reaction at the 500-1,000 degrees Celsius temperature range at which these devices generally operate. Wiria and Su therefore sought to develop a heat-resistant version of this system."</em> <a href="https://research.a-star.edu.sg/research/7932/helping-fuel-cells-beat-the-heat">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://news.mit.edu/2018/first-ionic-wind-plane-no-moving-parts-1121">MIT engineers fly first-ever plane with no moving parts</a></h2>

<p><em>"The silent, lightweight aircraft doesn’t depend on fossil fuels or batteries. Since the first airplane took flight over 100 years ago, virtually every aircraft in the sky has flown with the help of moving parts such as propellers, turbine blades, and fans, which are powered by the combustion of fossil fuels or by battery packs that produce a persistent, whining buzz. Now MIT engineers have built and flown the first-ever plane with no moving parts. Instead of propellers or turbines, the light aircraft is powered by an “ionic wind” — a silent but mighty flow of ions that is produced aboard the plane, and that generates enough thrust to propel the plane over a sustained, steady flight. Unlike turbine-powered planes, the aircraft does not depend on fossil fuels to fly. And unlike propeller-driven drones, the new design is completely silent."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2018/first-ionic-wind-plane-no-moving-parts-1121">[...]</a>

The principle of operation of the simplest sensors is that water has to short two (or more) metal pins, and as soon as it happens, alarm triggers.

<p><em>"An open microbial bioreactor for growing cultures of about 1L. Story We are building an open source, benchtop, batch bioreactor to optimise yield of enzymes producing recombinant proteins for molecular biology such as Taq polymerase or for cell-free extract production. This built on existing open source projects to further reduce the cost of components and pay particular attention to their global accessibility. By generating a modular design with thorough and useful documentation of different options to suit budget and accuracy requirements, we will make these devices easier to build and maintain for a wider range of users in universities, companies and biomaker spaces: in particular those in resource-constrained contexts.
