<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1863, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Safford_Parker">George Parker</a>. Este Inventor norte-americano aperfeiçoou a caneta-tinteiro e fundou a Parker Pen Company para fabricá-la. Ele começou numa carreira docente que o introduziu na falta de fiabilidade das canetas usadas pelos seus alunos. Através da venda e reparação delas, ele aprendeu sobre sua construção. Deixou de ensinar em 1888 para experimentar seu próprio projeto. Em 8 de março de 1892, ele incorporou a Parker Pen Company. Posteriormente, ele patenteou muitas melhorias e foi particularmente bem-sucedido na criação de um sistema fiável de fluxo de tinta.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1879, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Barnack">Oskar Barnack</a>. Este engenheiro alemão projetou a primeira câmara miniatura (1913), a Leica I. A sua introdução comercial, adiada pela primeira guerra mundial, foi feita em 1924 pela empresa de ótica Ernst Leitz em Wetzlar, Alemanha, onde ele estava empregado. Barnack era um fotógrafo entusiasta numa altura em que apenas as câmaras pesadas estavam disponíveis. No início de 1905, ele concebeu usando um negativo de formato reduzido, para ser ampliado após a exposição. Ele adaptou sua ideia do equipamento que ele fez para tirar fotos em filmes cinematográficos para testar a sua sensibilidade e consistência antes do uso do filme. Para esta câmara, Barnack estabeleceu o tamanho padrão de filme de 35 mm ao dobrar o quadro de cinema padrão de 18x24mm. A sua invenção tinha apenas 1/250 do peso de uma câmara de placa.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1911, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_William_Kerst">Donald William Kerst</a>. Este físico norte-americano inventou o betatron (1940), o primeiro dispositivo para acelerar electrões ("partículas beta") a velocidades altas o suficiente para ter um momento suficiente para produzir transformações nucleares em átomos. Os electrões são acelerados por indução eletromagnética num anel em forma de donut (toroidal) do qual o ar foi removido. Este tipo de acelerador de partículas pode produzir electrões de alta energia até 340 MeV para fins de pesquisa, incluindo a produção de raios X de alta energia. Para tais velocidades altas, o campo magnético é aumentado para coincidir com o aumento relativístico na massa das partículas. Durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial, Kerst trabalhou em Los Alamos em um projecto de bomba atómica. Ele completou o maior betatron em 1950, na Universidade de Illinois.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1950. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_B._Laughlin">Robert B. Laughlin</a>. Este Físico norte-americano partilhou (com Daniel C. Tsui e Horst Störmer) o Prémio Nobel de Física em 1998 pela pesquisa sobre o efeito quântico de Hall fracionário. Num condutor de corrente, o efeito Hall clássico é a voltagem produzida em ângulo recto com um campo magnético, como descoberto em 1879. Um século depois, o físico alemão Klaus von Klitzing descobriu que num poderoso campo magnético a temperaturas extremamente baixas a resistência Hall de um semicondutor é quantificada em “passos” integrais. Usando campos magnéticos ainda mais fortes e temperaturas mais baixas, Störmer e Tsui descobriram etapas fracionarias, explicadas pela teoria de Laughlin de que os electrões podem formar um novo tipo de fluido quântico com quasi-partículas contendo fracções de uma carga do electrão.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou foi lançado o Fedora 29. Dentro de 1 semana fará 15 anos desde que foi lançado o Fedora 1. Esta nova versão do Fedora foi preparada para diferentes ambientes como o "core", Workstation, Server, Atomic Host, etc. Em termos de novidades esta versão trás como principio a sua modularidade que permite enviar diferentes versões de pacotes na mesma base do Fedora. Outras grandes mudanças incluem o GNOME 3.30 na área de trabalho, o ZRAM para as imagens ARM e uma imagem Vagrant para o Fedora Scientific.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou também ficámos a saber que a NASA desactivou o telescópio espacial Kepler. Depois de nove anos no espaço profundo obtendo dados que indicam que o nosso céu será preenchido com biliões de planetas ocultos - mais planetas até que estrelas - o telescópio espacial Kepler da NASA ficou sem combustível necessário para outras operações científicas. A NASA decidiu aposentar a sonda dentro de sua órbita actual e segura, longe da Terra. Kepler deixa um legado de mais de 2.600 descobertas de planetas de fora do nosso sistema solar, muitas das quais poderiam ser lugares promissores para a vida.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como um modelo 3D que poderá ser útil. São apresentadas as newelectronics de 22 e 23 de Outubro de 2018.</p>

<p><em>"After nine years in deep space collecting data that indicate our sky to be filled with billions of hidden planets - more planets even than stars - NASA's Kepler space telescope has run out of fuel needed for further science operations. NASA has decided to retire the spacecraft within its current, safe orbit, away from Earth. Kepler leaves a legacy of more than 2,600 planet discoveries from outside our solar system, many of which could be promising places for life. "As NASA's first planet-hunting mission, Kepler has wildly exceeded all our expectations and paved the way for our exploration and search for life in the solar system and beyond," said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. "Not only did it show us how many planets could be out there, it sparked an entirely new and robust field of research that has taken the science community by storm. Its discoveries have shed a new light on our place in the universe, and illuminated the tantalizing mysteries and possibilities among the stars.""</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7272">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The LSM6DSO iNEMO™ Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) from STMicroelectronics is an always-on 3D accelerometer and 3D gyroscope system-in-package that is, by itself, extremely power efficient and accurate. At the same time, the IMU makes the entire embedded system around it more power efficient, too. Always-On Inertial Measurement Unit from STMicroelectronics Improves Accuracy, Optimizes System Power Two key features play into this increased system-level power efficiency. The LSM6DSO contains a 9k-byte FIFO that can store significantly more data than comparable sensors and, as a result, allows the system processor to wait longer and make fewer requests for data. In addition, the LSM6DSO adds a MIPI I3C℠ serial interface to a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) / I2C. The higher speed MIPI I3C interface offers dynamic address assignment, follower-initiated communication, and communication speeds about 10x faster than I2C."</em> <a href="https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/about/media-center/press-item.html/n4097.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Beijing-based Landscape says ‘something abnormal happened’ in the third stage of its ZQ-1 rocket A privately developed Chinese carrier rocket failed to reach orbit after lifting off from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre on Saturday, in a blow to the country’s nascent attempts by private companies to rival Elon Musk’s SpaceX. The three-stage rocket, Zhuque-1, was developed by Beijing-based Landspace. The company said in a microblog post after nominal first and second stages that the spacecraft failed to reach orbit as a result of an issue with the third stage. The company said that “cowling separation was normal but something abnormal happened after the second stage.” The statement on its Weibo social media account did not elaborate. Landspace was founded in 2015 and soon aimed to be the first Chinese private company to deliver a satellite into orbit. The company said it was the first private licensed company in China to launch carrier rockets."</em> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/28/first-private-chinese-attempt-to-send-rocket-into-space-fails">[...]</a>

Dawn missed scheduled communications sessions with NASA's Deep Space Network on Wednesday, Oct. 31, and Thursday, Nov. 1. After the flight team eliminated other possible causes for the missed communications, mission managers concluded that the spacecraft finally ran out of hydrazine, the fuel that enables the spacecraft to control its pointing. Dawn can no longer keep its antennae trained on Earth to communicate with mission control or turn its solar panels to the Sun to recharge. The Dawn spacecraft launched 11 years ago to visit the two largest objects in the main asteroid belt. Currently, it's in orbit around the dwarf planet Ceres, where it will remain for decades."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7275">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Caltech engineers create an optical gyroscope smaller than a grain of rice Mechanical versus Optical Gyroscopes Gyroscopes are devices that help vehicles, drones, and wearable and handheld electronic devices know their orientation in three-dimensional space. They are commonplace in just about every bit of technology we rely on every day. Originally, gyroscopes were sets of nested wheels, each spinning on a different axis. But open up a cell phone today, and you will find a microelectromechanical sensor (MEMS), the modern-day equivalent, which measures changes in the forces acting on two identical masses that are oscillating and moving in opposite directions. These MEMS gyroscopes are limited in their sensitivity, so optical gyroscopes have been developed to perform the same function but with no moving parts and a greater degree of accuracy using a phenomenon called the Sagnac effect.

<p><em>"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) researchers are working to make better electronic devices by delving into the way nanocrystals are arranged inside of them. Nanocrystals are promising building blocks for new and improved electronic devices, due to their size-tunable properties and ability to integrate into devices at low-cost. While the structure of nanocrystals has been extensively studied, no one has been able to watch the full assembly process. That’s where LLNL scientists Christine Orme, Yixuan Yu, Babak Sadigh and a colleague from the University of California, Los Angeles come in. ‘We think the situation can be improved if detailed quantitative information on the nanocrystal assembly process could be identified and if the crystallization process were better controlled,” said Orme, an LLNL material scientist and corresponding author of a paper appearing in the journal Nature Communications. Nanocrystals inside devices form ensembles, whose collective physical properties, such as charge carrier mobility, depend on both the properties of individual nanocrystals and the way they are arranged."</em> <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/news/nanocrystals-arrange-improve-electronics">[...]</a>

<p><em>"An innovative filtering material may soon reduce the environmental cost of manufacturing plastic. Created by a team including scientists at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the advance can extract the key ingredient in the most common form of plastic from a mixture of other chemicals—while consuming far less energy than usual. The material is a metal-organic framework (MOF), a class of substances that have repeatedly demonstrated a talent for separating individual hydrocarbons from the soup of organic molecules produced by oil refining processes. MOFs hold immense value for the plastic and petroleum industries because of this capability, which could allow manufacturers to perform these separations far more cheaply than standard oil-refinement techniques. This promise has made MOFs the subject of intense study at NIST and elsewhere, leading to MOFs that can separate different octanes of gasoline and speed up complex chemical reactions. One major goal has proved elusive, though: an industrially preferred method for wringing out ethylene—the molecule needed to create polyethylene, the plastic used to make shopping bags and other everyday containers."</em> <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2018/10/novel-material-could-make-plastic-manufacturing-more-energy-efficient">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Finding ways to improve the drug development process – which is currently costly, time-consuming and has an astronomically high failure rate – could have far-reaching benefits for health care and the economy. Researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology have designed a cellular interfacing array using low-cost electronics that measures multiple cellular properties and responses in real time. This could enable many more potential drugs to be comprehensively tested for efficacy and toxic effects much faster. That’s why Hua Wang, associate professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech, describes it as “helping us find the golden needle in the haystack.” Pharmaceutical companies use cell-based assays, a combination of living cells and sensor electronics, to measure physiological changes in the cells. That data is used for high-throughput screening (HTS) during drug discovery. In this early phase of drug development, the goal is to identify target pathways and promising chemical compounds that could be developed further – and to eliminate those that are ineffective or toxic – by measuring the physiological responses of the cells to each compound."</em> <a href="https://www.news.gatech.edu/2018/10/24/new-chip-measures-multiple-cellular-responses-speed-drug-discovery">[...]</a>

The project is being led by Roger French, the Kyocera Professor in the Materials Science and Engineering Department at the Case School of Engineering and head of the SDLE Research Center at Case Western Reserve. “This is the new challenge for solar energy—a 50-year lifetime for photovoltaic (PV) modules,” said French, whose research team had in 2017 received a similar $1.47 million Department of Energy grant to test new commercial silicon solar cell technology. “Right now, the lifetime of a solar panel is about 25 to 30 years, so this is a big jump, but one that can be made.” Building a better solar panel Specifically, the research at Case Western Reserve is expected to help determine the relative value of two different kinds of module construction for encapsulating photovoltaic cells: one of double-glass construction and the other known as glass/backsheet, where the backsheet is instead a multilayer polymer laminate. Each type of PV module construction has its advantages and disadvantages: double-glass better protects the structural integrity of the PV cells inside, but can also trap corrosive degradation products inside; glass/backsheet, on the other hand, “breathes” better to allow corrosives to leak out, but offers less physical protection to the inside components. “My background is in chemistry, so I’m looking at the chemical degradation of polymers inside the solar panels, especially in the glass-glass construction, as many manufacturers are starting to use that method,” said Laura Bruckman, an associate research professor at the center."</em> <a href="https://thedaily.case.edu/making-solar-panels-last-half-century/">[...]</a>

Now researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) and the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis (JCAP), a DOE Energy Innovation Hub, have come up with a new recipe for renewable fuels that could bypass the limitations in current materials: an artificial photosynthesis device called a “hybrid photoelectrochemical and voltaic (HPEV) cell” that turns sunlight and water into not just one, but two types of energy – hydrogen fuel and electricity. The paper describing this work was published on Oct. 29 in Nature Materials. Finding a way out for electrons Most water-splitting devices are made of a stack of light-absorbing materials.

<p><em>"A faster, cheaper modeling method could improve our understanding of long-term atmospheric chemistry and provide a powerful tool for risk assessment. To assess long-range risks to food, water, energy and other critical natural resources, decision-makers often rely on Earth-system models capable of producing reliable projections of regional and global environmental changes spanning decades. A key component of such models is the representation of atmospheric chemistry. Atmospheric simulations utilizing state-of-the-art complex chemical mechanisms promise the most accurate simulations of atmospheric chemistry. Unfortunately their size, complexity, and computational requirements have tended to limit such simulations to short time periods and a small number of scenarios to account for uncertainty. Now a team of researchers led by the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change has devised a strategy to incorporate simplified chemical mechanisms in atmospheric simulations that can match the results produced by more complex mechanisms for most regions and time periods."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2018/mit-researchers-develop-faster-cheaper-modeling-atmospheric-chemistry-1024">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://news.mit.edu/2018/new-liquid-repelling-surfaces-hydrophobic-1101">A new approach to liquid-repelling surfaces</a></h2>

<p><em>"Novel surface design overcomes problem of condensation that bedeviled previous systems. “Omniphobic” might sound like a way to describe someone who is afraid of everything, but it actually refers to a special type of surface that repels virtually any liquid. Such surfaces could potentially be used in everything from ship hulls that reduce drag and increase efficiency, to coverings that resist stains and protect against damaging chemicals. But the omniphobic surfaces developed so far suffer from a major problem: Condensation can quickly disable their liquid-shedding properties. Now, researchers at MIT have found a way to overcome this effect, producing a surface design that drastically reduces the effects of condensation, although at a slight sacrifice in performance. The new findings are described in the journal ACS Nano, in a paper by graduate student Kyle Wilke, professor of mechanical engineering and department head Evelyn Wang, and two others."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2018/new-liquid-repelling-surfaces-hydrophobic-1101">[...]</a>

<p><em>"MIT researchers have demonstrated that a Tungsten ditelluride-based transistor combines two different electronic states of matter. A transistor based on the 2-D material tungsten ditelluride (WTe2) sandwiched between boron nitride can switch between two different electronic states — one that conducts current only along its edges, making it a topological insulator, and one that conducts current with no resistance, making it a superconductor — researchers at MIT and colleagues from four other institutions have demonstrated. Using four-probe measurements, a common quantum electronic transport technique to measure the electronic behavior of materials, the researchers plotted the current carrying capacity and resistance characteristics of the two-dimensional tungsten ditelluride transistor and confirmed their findings across a range of applied voltages and external magnetic fields at extremely low temperatures. “This is the first time that the exact same material can be tuned either to a topological insulator or to a superconductor,” says Pablo Jarillo-Herrero, the Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Physics at MIT. “We can do this by regular electric field effect using regular, standard dielectrics, so basically the same type of technology you use in standard semiconductor electronics.” New class of materials “This is the first of a new class of materials — topological insulators that can be tuned electrically into superconductors — which opens many possibilities which before there were significant obstacles to realize,” Jarillo-Herrero says. “Having one material where you can do this seamlessly within the same material to transition between this topological insulator and superconductor is something which is potentially very attractive.” Tungsten ditelluride, which is one of the transition metal dichalcogenide materials, is classified as a semimetal and conducts electricity like metals in bulk form."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2018/mit-research-first-2-d-material-topological-insulator-superconductor-1031">[...]</a>

I have always had an idea of putting nixies under glass but when I received the first glass dome I ordered a few years ago out of curiosity I was put off due to it being very rough looking. I recently managed to get some smooth matching glass domes from PV Electronics that were ideal for the project. The next thing was to get matching colon tubes and the solution was 12 x 100 mm rimless test tubes.

<p><em>"An ATtiny-based tiny USB lamp that can be turned on/off by knocking, clapping, blowing, finger snapping and shouting. If you don't mind having a bit of fun with electronics this project is for you. In this project, I am making an ATtiny-based USB lamp that can be turned off/on by multiple sources such as: Knocking Clapping Blowing Finger Snapping Shouting In this project I utilized, or I can say I misused, microphone sound sensor to detect different sources to turn on and turn off lamp.Also I wanted to make this project as small as possible, so I used a ATtiny 85 microconntroller.This is cool because the ATtiny is tiny, and - well - this allows you to make tiny things that don't need a big micro controller. Basic Idea A microphone is an acoustic to an electric transducer or sensor that detects sound signals and converts them into an electrical signal. To generate an electrical signal all you need to do is make movements in the diaphragm. So when blowing on a microphone sound sensor, microphone’s diaphragm responds because it is a displacement of air molecules pushing on one side of the membrane to the other causing electrical signal in the microphone to make it seem like sound."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/amalmathewtech/multi-source-controlled-usb-lamp-0b6060">[...]</a>

This optical theremin depends on the intensity of light that falls on a photoresistor which can be controlled by the movement of the player's hand.

To demonstrate the graphics library I've written a simple application to measure the temperature every 15 minutes over a 24-hour period and display it as a live chart. Introduction The monochrome OLED graphics displays are accessed a byte at a time, and each byte represents 8 pixels; to plot a point you need to change just one pixel leaving the others unaffected, so you need to know what the previous contents of the byte were. The usual way to implement graphics commands on this type of display is to use a RAM buffer, and do all the drawing into the buffer."</em> <a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?23OS">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Arduino Balancing Itself Robot This Robot is based on the Joop Brokking Project (YABR - Your Arduino Balancing Robot) Adapted for my building conditions and PID adjustments. The Robot has a very simple construction, but it has many concepts that can be learned and / or improved with the construction and adjustment of this robot. Constraining with other self-balancing robots, you will notice that it uses step motors unlike many (the majority) who use DC motors with gearboxes that are cheaper; but the one that uses stepper motor, offers much more opportunity of an excellent control of movement. DC motors have a lot of mechanical friction and electrical differentials that degrade over time and causes changes of performance over time, since stepper motors are free of these factors with much greater durability and constancy of operation. In this post I will show all the details of building the robot itself, also called self-balancing. It consists of an Arduino module with an MPU (Gyroscope and Accelerometer) controlling the angle and rotation of the robot to keep it balanced on the axis vertically, the control is done by driving two step motors so that it can have the balancing action using PID control to keep the robot upright (even when an external force is applied)."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/ABIR-Arduino-Balancing-Itself-Robot/">[...]</a>
