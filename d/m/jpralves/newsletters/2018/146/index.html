<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1564, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei">Galileo Galilei</a>. Este filósofo natural italiano aplicou técnicas do método científico para fazer descobertas significativas na física e astronomia. As suas grandes realizações incluem o aperfeiçoamento (embora não inventando) do telescópio e contribuições consequentes para a astronomia. Estudou a ciência do movimento, a inércia, a lei da queda dos corpos e as trajectórias parabólicas. A sua formulação do método científico iguala escritos de Francis Bacon. O seu progresso chegou com um preço, quando as suas ideias estavam em conflito com o dogma religioso da época.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1827, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_A._Pratt">Francis Pratt</a>. Este engenheiro mecânico norte-americano e fabricante de máquinas-ferramentas ficou conhecido por, em 1855, ter produzido a fresadora "Lincoln", que usava uma ferramenta de parafusos para melhorar o anterior projecto de cremalheira e pinhão de F.W. Howe. Pratt formou uma parceria com Amos Whitney em 1860 e, em conjunto, desenvolveu o sistema de peças intercambiáveis que foram pioneiras por Samuel Colt, Elisha Root, o primo de Amos Eli Whitney e outros. Isso, por sua vez, levou à necessidade de estabelecer padrões nacionais de medição. A Companhia Pratt &amp; Whitney foi criada em 1869, fazendo vários tipos de medidores para possibilitar esses padrões na fabricação, fazendo ferramentas mecânicas em especial para a indústria de armamento.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1834, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Henry_Preece">William Henry Preece</a>. Este engenheiro electrotécnico galês foi uma figura importante no desenvolvimento e introdução do telegrafo sem fio e do telefone na Grã-Bretanha. O interesse de Preece em electricidade aplicada e engenharia telegráfica foi desenvolvido como um estudante de graduação sob Michael Faraday. Durante 29 anos, a partir de 1870, foi engenheiro no sistema telegráfico do Correio e contribuiu com muitas invenções e melhorias, incluindo um sistema de sinalização ferroviária que aumentou a segurança ferroviária. Um pioneiro na telegrafia sem fio, ele originou seu próprio sistema em 1892. Ele incentivou Guglielmo Marconi, obtendo assistência do Correio por seu trabalho. Preece também introduziu na Grã-Bretanha os primeiros telefones Bell.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1845, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Wood_Johnson_I">Robert Wood Johnson</a>. Este fabricante norte-americano ficou conhecido por, com seus dois irmãos, ter fundado a Johnson &amp; Johnson Corporation, para fazer curativos cirúrgicos (1885) e foi seu primeiro presidente. Em 1876, ele inspirou-se numa palestra do notável cirurgião inglês Sir Joseph Lister, pioneiro da cirurgia anti-séptica. Johnson estabeleceu para criar um curativo cirúrgico pronto e que poderia ser usado sem risco de contaminação. Ele trabalhou para desenvolver um curativo que poderia permanecer tão livre de germes quanto possível entre suas fábricas e seus usos médicos em todo o país. Ele também trabalhou para melhorar as práticas sanitárias no século XIX. Ao longo do tempo, a empresa diversificou-se em muitos mais produtos de consumo e agora vende uma ampla gama de produtos de saúde em todo o mundo.</p>

<p>Por fim também anos hoje que nasciam, em 1861, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_North_Whitehead">Alfred North Whitehead</a> e <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_%C3%89douard_Guillaume">Charles Édouard Guillaume</a>. O primeiro era um matemático e filósofo inglês, que trabalhou em lógica, física, filosofia da ciência e metafísica. Ele é mais conhecido pelo seu trabalho com Bertrand Russell num dos livros mais famosos do século, Principia Mathematica (1910-13) para demonstrar que a lógica é a base para toda a matemática. Na física (1910-24), o seu trabalho mais conhecido era uma teoria da gravidade, que competia com a relatividade geral de Einstein por muitas décadas. Posteriormente, a partir de 1924, em Harvard, ele trabalhou em questões mais gerais de filosofia do que em matemática, incluindo o desenvolvimento de um sistema metafísico abrangente o que passou a ser conhecido como filosofia de processo. O Segundo, Charles, era um Físico francês que estudou ligas de ferro-níquel e descobriu a Invar (uma liga de níquel-aço) que lhe permitiu conquistar o Prémio Nobel de Física em 1920. Em 1883, Guillaume tornou-se assistente do novo Escritório Internacional de Pesos e Medidas em Sèvres, perto de Paris, e tornou-se seu director (1915-36). Ele estava preocupado com a termometria; e desenvolver os padrões internacionais para o medidor, o quilograma e o litro. A partir de 1890, investigou intensamente várias ligas. Após um estudo metódico de ligas de níquel-aço, ele inventou a liga invar, tendo uma expansão muito pequena com aumento de temperatura, foi imediatamente adoptada em molas de relógios e outros componentes. Ele também produziu elinvar, com uma elasticidade que permanece quase constante numa ampla gama de temperaturas.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que a equipa olímpica dos EUA de trenó constrói o seu trenó através de um processo 3D. Este permite-lhes desenhar e construir o trenó com a especificações exactas para o atleta.</p>

<p>Esta semana também ficámos a saber que uma equipa de cirurgiões usam o Microsoft HoloLens para "ver dentro" dos pacientes antes de fazerem operações neles. Uma equipa do Imperial College London está a usar dispositivos HoloLens nas salas de operação para que eles possam detectar os principais vasos sanguíneos, ossos e músculos, tornando os procedimentos mais rápidos e seguros.
O HoloLens permite que os cirurgiões façam exames de tomografia computadorizada que já foram completados e sobreponham modelos digitais 3D deles no membro de um paciente durante a cirurgia reconstrutiva.</p>

<p>Esta semana também ficámos a conhecer a proeza de David Nadlinger, que apreende átomos para sua pesquisa de computação quântica na Universidade de Oxford. Ele capturou uma imagem em 7 de Agosto usando uma câmara DSLR padrão. A foto mostra um pinpick de um átomo de estrôncio carregado positivamente iluminado por uma luz azul-violeta num fundo preto. O átomo é mantido quase imóvel por um campo eléctrico que emana de dois eléctrodos metálicos colocados de cada lado. A distância entre as pontas de agulha pequenas da armadilha de iões é inferior a 0,08 de polegada. Trata-se de uma proeza rara que foi partilhada ao mundo através de equipamento normal.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como um modelo 3D  que poderá ser útil. São apresentadas as revistas newelectronics de 13 de Fevereiro e a Hackspace nº4.</p>

<p><em>"The quest for Olympic gold is the search for the slightest leg up — small changes that could ultimately shave fractions of a second off of one’s time. It’s an ideal platform for a technology like 3D printing, where the ability to customize products can have a dramatic effect on their physical qualities. No surprise, really, that more teams are turning to technology for a leg up. The United States’ luge team jumped on the bandwagon in the lead up to PyeongChang, enlisting the help of Stratasys to design a better sled. This week, U.S. Olympians Justin Krewson and Andrew Sherk will be riding sleds designed with help from the industrial-3D-printing giant. Stratasys applications engineer Dave Dahl tells TechCrunch that two former members of the team approached the company at the International Manufacturing Technology Show."</em> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/14/how-team-usa-used-3d-printing-to-build-a-better-luge/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Surgeons in the UK are using Microsoft’s mixed-reality headset to “see inside” patients before they operate on them. A team at Imperial College London are wearing HoloLens devices in operating theatres so they can spot key blood vessels, bones and muscles, making procedures quicker and safer. HoloLens allows the surgeons to take CT scans that have previously been completed and overlay 3D digital models of them onto a patient’s limb during reconstructive surgery. The technique has been used to help surgeons successfully move blood vessels from one part of the body to another to help open wounds heal. Patients have included a 41-year-old man who injured his leg in a car crash, an 85-year-old woman who fractured her fibula and a person who developed an infection that required surgery. Dr Philip Pratt, a Research Fellow in the Department of Surgery and Cancer at Imperial College London, said HoloLens is allowing surgeons to understand a patient’s unique anatomy very quickly and accurately."</em> <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/en-gb/2018/02/08/surgeons-use-microsoft-hololens-to-see-inside-patients-before-they-operate-on-them/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The award-winning long-exposure photograph captures a positively charged atom suspended in an ion trap. Sometimes, all it takes to capture a great photo is a DSLR camera, a microscopic atom, and a curious Ph.D. candidate. David Nadlinger, who traps atoms for his quantum computing research at the University of Oxford, captured this image on August 7 using a standard DSLR camera. The photo shows a pinprick of a positively charged strontium atom illuminated by a blue-violet light on a black background. The atom is held nearly motionless by an electric field emanating from two metal electrodes placed on either side of it. The distance between the ion trap's small needle tips is less than .08 of an inch."</em> <a href="https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/02/trapped-atom-photograph-long-exposure-competition-spd/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Two small asteroids recently discovered by astronomers at the NASA-funded Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) near Tucson, Arizona, are safely passing by Earth within one lunar distance this week. The first of this week's close-approaching asteroids -- discovered by CSS on Feb. 4 -- is designated asteroid 2018 CC. Its close approach to Earth came Tuesday (Feb. 6) at 12:10 p.m. PST (3:10 p.m. EST) at a distance of about 114,000 miles (184,000 kilometers). The asteroid is estimated to be between 50 and 100 feet (15 and 30 meters) in size. Of potentially greater interest is asteroid 2018 CB,which will also pass closely by Earth on Friday, Feb. 9, at around 2:30 p.m. PST (5:30 p.m. EST), at a distance of about 39,000 miles (64,000 kilometers), which is less than one-fifth the distance of Earth to the Moon). The asteroid, which is estimated to be between 50 and 130 feet (15 and 40 meters) in size, was also discovered by CSS on Feb. 4."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7055">[...]</a>

<p><em>"NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) has begun extra stargazing to help the space agency accomplish advances in Mars exploration over the next decade. The spacecraft already has worked more than double its planned mission life since launch in 2005. NASA plans to keep using it past the mid-2020s. Increased reliance on a star tracker, and less on aging gyroscopes, is one way the mission is adapting to extend its longevity. Another step is wringing more useful life from batteries. The mission's extended service provides data relay from assets on Mars' surface and observations with its science instruments, despite some degradation in capabilities."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7059">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35407431">The man who built an arm out of scrap metal</a></h2>

<p><em>"When a man in a small village in Bali claimed to have made a functioning bionic arm out of scrap metal at home he became a local sensation. But even as serious doubts emerged about the technology behind it, BBC Indonesian's Christine Franciska found his fellow villagers remained enthralled by the mystical aspect of his story. It takes two hours from the Balinese capital Denpasar to reach Nyuhtebel Village in Karangasem, the home of the man who has been dubbed "cyborg" or "Iron Man" by the local press. I Wayan Sumardana, a 31-year-old welder in a small village in Bali, said he woke up one morning six months ago to find he had lost all feeling in his left arm. "At first, I thought it was a light stroke, but my doctor couldn't explain what was happening. He said go to the shaman, but the shamans gave up too," he said."</em> <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35407431">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Airbus Helicopters’ Skyways unmanned air vehicle has successfully completed its first flight demonstration at the National University of Singapore (NUS). The drone took off from its dedicated maintenance centre and landed on the roof of a specially designed parcel station where a parcel was automatically loaded via a robotic arm. Once successfully loaded with the parcel, the Skyways drone took off again and returned to land, demonstrating its automatic unloading capability. This inaugural flight demonstration follows the launch of the experimental project with the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) in February 2016 to develop an urban unmanned air system to address the safety, efficiency, and sustainability of the air delivery business in cities such as Singapore. The collaboration was subsequently extended in April 2017 with Singapore Post (SingPost) becoming the local logistics partner to the project. Airbus Helicopters is the overall Skyways system architect and provider, contributing its capabilities in drone platforms as well as its concept of future parcel delivery."</em> <a href="http://www.airbus.com/newsroom/press-releases/en/2018/02/airbus-completes-first-flight-demonstration-for-its-commercial-p.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Quantum computing is heralded for its potential to tackle problems that today’s conventional computers can’t handle. Scientists and industries are looking to quantum computing to speed advancements in areas like chemistry or drug development, financial modeling, and even climate forecasting. To deliver on quantum computing’s potential, Intel initiated a collaborative research program in 2015 with the goal of developing a commercially viable quantum computing system. While there’s been significant progress, quantum computing research is still nascent. The industry is at mile one in a marathon, and to realize this new computing paradigm, many problems must be solved and many architectural decisions must be made.

<p><em>"Allegro MicroSystems, LLC announces the release of a new family of 2D Hall-Effect Latch ICs that feature both vertical and planar Hall elements. The APS12625 and APS12626 sensor ICs enable reduced system size and bill-of-materials (BOM) cost along with an increase in performance and flexibility due to 2-dimensional (2D) sensing. They were developed in accordance with ISO 26262 and qualified per AEC-Q100, making them suitable for automotive and other safety systems. The APS12625 features Speed and Direction outputs whereas the APS12626 has quadrature (Channel A and B) outputs. A unique, optional feature allows the host system to restore the previous state of the sensor after a power-cycle. This reduces the potential accumulation of lost counts in intelligent motion applications such as window lifts with anti-pinch requirements."</em> <a href="https://www.allegromicro.com/en/About-Allegro/News-Room/2018/APS12625-APS12626-Press-Release.aspx">[...]</a>

Now a low-power system that’s always on the alert can turn devices on when they are needed, saving energy in the networked internet of things. As smartphone users know all too well, a sleeping device can still suck the life out of a battery. One solution for extending the battery life of wireless devices under development by researchers at Stanford University is to add a wake-up receiver that can turn on a shut-off device at a moment’s notice. Angad Rekhi, a graduate student in the Arbabian lab at Stanford, and Amin Arbabian, assistant professor of electrical engineering, have developed a wake-up receiver that turns on a device in response to incoming ultrasonic signals – signals outside the range that humans can hear. By working at a significantly smaller wavelength and switching from radio waves to ultrasound, this receiver is much smaller than similar wake-up receivers that respond to radio signals, while operating at extremely low power and with extended range."</em> <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2018/02/12/new-method-waking-devices/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Two Waterloo chemists have made it easier for manufacturers to produce a new class of faster and cheaper semiconductors. The chemists have found a way to simultaneously control the orientation and select the size of single-walled carbon nanotubes deposited on a surface. That means the developers of semiconductors can use carbon as opposed to silicon, which will reduce the size and increase the speed of the devices while improving their battery life. "We're reaching the limits of what's physically possible with silicon-based devices," said co-author Derek Schipper, Canada Research Chair Organic Material Synthesis at the University of Waterloo. "Not only would single-walled carbon nanotube-based electronics be more powerful, they would also consume less power." The process, called the Alignment Relay Technique, relies on liquid crystals to pass orientation information to a metal-oxide surface."</em> <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/news/news/mass-production-new-class-semiconductors-closer-reality">[...]</a>

<p><em>"We’re all connected — and not just in a yogic sense. By 2022, there will be 29 billion connected devices across the globe, according to a forecast from the June 2017 Ericsson mobility report. All of these devices will want a piece of the radio spectrum — the cluster of frequencies used by television, radio, and wireless signals — which will overcrowd radio bands. Researchers like Lingjia Liu and Yang (Cindy) Yi, associate and assistant professors, respectively, in the Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, are approaching the spectrum scarcity problem from various angles. From techniques to tap unoccupied channels and improve spectrum efficiency to establishing protocols for sharing previously restricted bands, Liu, Yi, and their collaborators are exploring new ways to meet the skyrocketing demand.

Most sensitive web transactions are protected by public-key cryptography, a type of encryption that lets computers share information securely without first agreeing on a secret encryption key. Public-key encryption protocols are complicated, and in computer networks, they’re executed by software. But that won’t work in the internet of things, an envisioned network that would connect many different sensors — embedded in vehicles, appliances, civil structures, manufacturing equipment, and even livestock tags — to online servers. Embedded sensors that need to maximize battery life can’t afford the energy and memory space that software execution of encryption protocols would require.

Most recent advances in artificial-intelligence systems such as speech- or face-recognition programs have come courtesy of neural networks, densely interconnected meshes of simple information processors that learn to perform tasks by analyzing huge sets of training data. But neural nets are large, and their computations are energy intensive, so they’re not very practical for handheld devices. Most smartphone apps that rely on neural nets simply upload data to internet servers, which process it and send the results back to the phone. Now, MIT researchers have developed a special-purpose chip that increases the speed of neural-network computations by three to seven times over its predecessors, while reducing power consumption 94 to 95 percent.

Acting at the microscale, they are materials or structures that can be designed such that, when released into an aqueous environment, they carry out a range of tasks.

The feat is a step toward making quantum computing devices from silicon, the same material used in today’s smartphones and computers. The research, published in the journal Nature, was led by researchers at Princeton University in collaboration with colleagues at the University of Konstanz in Germany and the Joint Quantum Institute, which is a partnership of the University of Maryland and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The team created qubits from single electrons trapped in silicon chambers known as double quantum dots. By applying a magnetic field, they showed they could transfer quantum information, encoded in the electron property known as spin, to a particle of light, or photon, opening the possibility of transmitting the quantum information. “This is a breakout year for silicon spin qubits,” said Jason Petta, professor of physics at Princeton."</em> <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/news/2018/02/14/better-together-silicon-qubits-plus-light-add-new-quantum-computing-capability">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This project is about implementing a short and relatively easy Arduino sketch to provide XYZ inverse kinematic positioning. I had built a 6 servo robotic arm but when it came to finding software to run it, there wasn't much out there except for custom programs running on custom servo shields like the SSC-32(U) or other programs and apps that were complicated to install and communicate with the arm. Then I found Oleg Mazurov's most excellent "Robotic Arm Inverse Kinematics on Arduino" where he implemented inverse kinematics in a simple Arduino sketch. I made two modifications to adapt his code: 1. I used the VarSpeedServo library in place of his custom servo shield library because I could then control the speed of the servos and I wouldn't have to use the servo shield he used. For any one considering running the code provided here I most insistently and emphatically recommend that you use this VarSpeedServo library,rather than the servo.h library, so that you can slow down your robotic arm movement during development or you may find that the arm will unexpectedly poke you in the face or worse because it will be moving at full servo speed."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Using-Arduino-Uno-for-XYZ-Positioning-of-6-DOF-Rob/">[...]</a>

They are often referred to as PIR, "Passive Infrared", "Pyroelectric", or "IR motion" sensors.PIRs are basically made of a pyroelectric sensor (which you can see below as the round metal can with a rectangular crystal in the center), which can detect levels of infrared radiation. Everything emits some low level radiation, and the hotter something is, the more radiation is emitted.
