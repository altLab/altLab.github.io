<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1781, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sim%C3%A9on_Denis_Poisson">Siméon Denis Poisson</a>. Este matemático francês ficou conhecido pelo seu trabalho em integrais definidas, avanços nas séries de Fourier, teoria electromagnética e probabilidade. A distribuição de Poisson (1837) descreve a probabilidade de que um evento aleatório ocorra num intervalo de tempo ou espaço sob as condições em que a probabilidade do evento ocorrer é muito pequena, mas o número de tentativas é muito grande para que o evento realmente ocorra poucas vezes. Os seus trabalhos incluíram aplicações para electricidade e magnetismo e astronomia. Ele também é conhecido pela integral de Poisson, pela equação de Poisson na teoria do potencial, pelos parênteses de Poisson nas equações diferenciais, pela razão de Poisson na elasticidade e pela constante de Poisson na electricidade.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1863, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Wolf">Max Wolf</a>. Este astrónomo alemão fundou e dirigiu o Observatório Königstuhl. Ele usou a fotografia de campo amplo para estudar a Via Láctea e usou o tratamento estatístico da contagem de estrelas para provar a existência de nuvens de matéria escura. Ele foi um dos primeiros astrónomos a mostrar que as nebulosas em espiral têm espectros de absorção típicos de estrelas e, portanto, diferem das nebulosas gasosas. A sua contribuição mais importante foi a introdução da fotografia para descobrir centenas de asteróides, o primeiro dos quais ele nomeou Brucia em homenagem ao doador de seu telescópio duplo de 16 polegadas, Catherine Wolfe Bruce.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1916, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Bamford">Joseph Bamford</a>. Este  inventor e industrial Inglês inventou e fabricou a máquina de construção JCB com uma pá operada hidraulicamente na frente e um braço de escavadora nas costas. Do negócio que levou suas iniciais, que ele começou numa garagem em 1945, e tornou-se num dos industriais mais bem sucedidos da Grã-Bretanha. Ele foi pioneiro a introduzir o conceito de retro-escavadora na Europa. Ele também é creditado com a ampla aplicação da tecnologia hidráulica na construção e equipamentos agrícolas. A empresa que ele fundou agora tem um mercado global de máquinas pesadas e máquinas agrícolas.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que os construtores de Stonehenge usaram o teorema de Pitágoras 2.000 anos antes do filósofo grego nascer. Um novo livro, Megalith, reexaminou a antiga geometria dos monumentos neolíticos e concluiu que eles foram construídos por astrónomos sofisticados que entendiam longos ciclos lunares, solares e de eclipses e construíram enormes calendários de pedra usando geometria complexa.</p>

<p>Também esta semana ficámos a saber que a China é pioneira em impressão 3D em cerâmica em micro-gravidade. O uso potencial mais excitante da tecnologia é construir bases na Lua, Marte ou outros planetas. Ou talvez apenas para beber chá de um copo feito de poeira lunar ou solo marciano. Cientistas do Centro de Tecnologia e Engenharia para Utilização Espacial da Academia Chinesa de Ciências (CAS) concluíram a primeira experiência de fabricação de cerâmica do mundo sob micro-gravidade, usando a tecnologia de processamento digital de luz a bordo de um avião europeu de voos parabólicos na Suíça.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. É apresentada a revista hackspace número 8 e o livro acelarando a transformação digital com contentores e Kubernetes.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2018/06/20/stonehenge-builders-used-pythagoras-theorem-2000-years-greek/">Stonehenge builders used Pythagoras' theorem 2,000 years before Greek philosopher was born, say experts </a></h2>

<p><em>"The builders of Britain’s ancient stone circles like Stonehenge were using Pythagoras' theorem 2,000 years before the Greek philosopher was born, experts have claimed. A new book, Megalith, has re-examined the ancient geometry of Neolithic monuments and concluded they were constructed by sophisticated astronomers who understood lengthy lunar, solar and eclipse cycles and built huge stone calendars using complex geometry One contributor, megalithic expert Robin Heath has even proposed that there exists a great Pythagorean triangle in the British landscape linking Stonehenge, the site from which the Preseli bluestones were cut in Wales, and Lundy Island, an important prehistoric site. Pythagoras’ discovery that the sum of the areas of two squares on the sides of a triangle will add up to the area of a square on hypotenuse has been used for millennia to help builders attain perfect right-angles. The new book, published today to coincide with today’s summer solstice, shows how within one of Stonehenge’s earliest incarnations, dating from 2750BC, there lies a rectangle of four Sarsen stones which when split in half diagonally forms a perfect Pythagorean 5:12:13 triangle. The eight lines which radiate from the rectangle and triangles also perfectly align to important dates in the Neolithic calendar, such as the summer and winter solstices and spring and autumn equinoxes. They also mark Imbolc, the ancient date for the beginning of Spring on February 1, Beltane, or May Day, lammas, the start of the wheat harvest and Samhain, October 31 which traditionally marked the time when cattle were brought down from summer pastures and slaughtered for the winter which has become Halloween."</em> <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2018/06/20/stonehenge-builders-used-pythagoras-theorem-2000-years-greek/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"One of the first civilizations to make ceramics about 10,000 years ago, China is now developing technology to manufacture ceramics in space. The most exciting potential use of the technology is to build bases on the Moon, Mars or other planets. Or maybe just to drink tea from a cup made of lunar dust or Martian soil. Scientists at the Technology and Engineering Center for Space Utilization of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) have completed the world's first ceramic manufacturing experiment under microgravity, using digital light processing technology aboard a European parabolic flight aircraft in Switzerland. "This is a widely used 3D printing technology, but it's previously been regarded as inapplicable in a microgravity environment," said Wang Gong, director of the CAS Key Laboratory of Space Manufacturing Technology. During the flight experiments, the scientists also tested a metal casting technique using 3D printed ceramic molds."</em> <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201806/19/WS5b291e1aa3104bcf48c155d9.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"3GPP TSG #80 Plenary Meeting has approved the completion of the standalone (SA) Release 15 5G specifications. After the release of the 5G NR specifications for non-standalone (NSA) operation in Dec. 2017, another essential step of standardization of 5G has been successfully completed. Now, the whole industry is taking the final sprint towards 5G commercialization. The completion of SA specifications which complements the NSA specifications, not only gives 5G NR the ability of independent deployment, but also brings a brand new end-to-end network architecture, making 5G a facilitator and an accelerator during the intelligent information and communications technology improvement process of enterprise customers and vertical industries. New business models will be enabled and a new era where everything is interconnected will be opened up for both mobile operators and industrial partners. More than 600 delegates from the world’s major telecom operators, network, terminals and chipset vendors, internet companies and other vertical industry companies have witnessed this historic moment for 5G."</em> <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/mobile-industry-works-together-to-deliver-complete-5g-system-standard-on-time">[...]</a>

<p><em>"From pool pumps to air handling units, closed-loop control is one of the most fundamental tasks performed by embedded systems. Advancements in the architecture of PIC® and AVR® 8-bit microcontrollers (MCUs) have optimized the devices for implementing closed-loop control, enabling systems to offload the Central Processing Unit (CPU) to manage more tasks and save power. To help designers maximize performance and efficiency in these systems, Microchip Technology Inc. (NASDAQ: MCHP) has introduced the new PIC18 Q10 and ATtiny1607 families, featuring multiple intelligent Core Independent Peripherals (CIPs) that simplify development and enable quick response time to system events. Ideal for applications that use closed-loop control, a key advantage of using the PIC18 Q10 and ATtiny1607 MCUs are the CIPs that independently manage tasks and reduce the amount of processing required from the CPU. System designers can also save time and simplify design efforts with the hardware-based CIPs, which significantly reduce the amount of software required to write and validate. Both families have features for functional safety and operate up to 5V, increasing noise immunity and providing compatibility with the majority of analog output and digital sensors."</em> <a href="https://www.microchip.com/pressreleasepage/optimize-closed-loop-control-applications-with-new-PIC-and-AVR-MCUs">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In 2012, Andrew Passmore thought he had taken a machine to its limits. His team of engineers had just upgraded a gas turbine powerful enough to supply with electricity the equivalent of 200,000 European homes. It was the second upgrade in seven years, but the team still managed to wring an extra 12 megawatts (MW) from the turbine, boosting its power capacity to 180 MW. They also pushed the machine’s maintenance interval to 48,000 hours, meaning that it could now generate power for nearly five and a half years without needing to go offline for service. Passmore, a senior product manager based in Baden, Switzerland, remembers feeling a sense of satisfaction. “At the time, we thought, ‘That’s it’ — we had reached the limits of this turbine,” he says."</em> <a href="https://www.ge.com/reports/hot-off-press-3d-printing-pushed-turbine-new-highs/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Norway tested a two-seater electric plane on Monday and predicted a start to passenger flights by 2025 if new aviation technologies match a green shift that has made Norwegians the world’s top buyers of electric cars. Transport Minister Ketil Solvik-Olsen and Dag Falk-Petersen, head of state-run Avinor which runs most of Norway’s airports, took a few minutes’ flight around Oslo airport in an Alpha Electro G2 plane, built by Pipistrel in Slovenia. “This is ... a first example that we are moving fast forward” toward greener aviation, Solvik-Olsen told Reuters. “We do have to make sure it is safe - people won’t fly if they don’t trust it.” He said plane makers such as Boeing and Airbus were developing electric aircraft and that battery prices were tumbling, making it feasible to reach a government goal of making all domestic flights in Norway electric by 2040. Asked when passenger flights in electric planes could start, Falk-Petersen, the pilot, said: “My best guess is before 2025 ... It should all be electrified by 2040.” The two said the plane, with a takeoff weight of 570 kg (1255 lb), was cramped and buffeted by winds but far quieter than a conventional plane run on fossil fuels."</em> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-norway-electric-flight/norway-tests-tiny-electric-plane-sees-passenger-flights-by-2025-idUSKBN1JE27D">[...]</a>

"On Sunday, at 00:46 Moscow time [21:46 GMT]… the Space Forces of the Aerospace Forces successfully launched a middle-class Soyuz-2.1b carrier rocket with a navigation Glonass-M spacecraft," the ministry said in a statement. Hours later the ministry reported that the satellite reached the designated orbit. "The middle-class Soyuz-2.1b carrier rocket launched on June 17 at 00:46 [21:46 GMT on Saturday] from the Plesetsk space center (Arkhangelsk Region) successfully put the Russian navigation Glonass-M spacecraft to the designated orbit," the ministry's press service said. Earlier, a satellite producer Reshetnev Information Satellite Systems reported that the signal interface control document for GLONASS would be updated in 2018, making radio signals to the satellite navigation system less susceptible to corruption. The developed in soviet-era navigation system GLONASS (the Russian acronym for 'Global Navigation Satellite System') was intended to become operational in 1995, the same year that the US launched its GPS, but due to lack of funding the system was put on hold."</em> <a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201806171065481287-russian-military-launch-navy-satellite/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://news.panasonic.com/global/press/data/2018/06/en180619-3/en180619-3.html">Panasonic Develops Long-range TOF Image Sensor</a></h2>

<p><em>"This new image sensor is capable of detecting objects 250 m ahead at night with poor visibility and achieves high resolution by adopting APD with 250,000 pixels Panasonic Corporation announced today that it has developed a time-of-flight (TOF) image sensor [2] that uses avalanche photodiode (APD) [1] pixels and is capable of capturing range imaging of objects up to 250 m even at night with poor visibility. The sensor can be applied in a variety of fields including automotive range imaging and wide-area surveillance in the dark. The newly developed TOF image sensor directly measures the time-of-flight of light between an object and the sensor at all the pixels and collectively obtains 3D range images for short to long distances.

Have you ever plugged in a vacuum cleaner, only to have it turn off without warning before the job is done?

These interruptions are likely “nuisance trips,” in which a detector installed behind the wall trips an outlet’s electrical circuit when it senses something that could be an arc-fault — a potentially dangerous spark in the electric line.

In a recent paper published in Nature, our IBM Research AI team demonstrated deep neural network (DNN) training with large arrays of analog memory devices at the same accuracy as a Graphical Processing Unit (GPU)-based system. We believe this is a major step on the path to the kind of hardware accelerators necessary for the next AI breakthroughs. Why? Because delivering the Future of AI will require vastly expanding the scale of AI calculations."</em> <a href="http://newsroom.ibm.com/IBM-research?item=30539">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Many current and future technologies require alloys that can withstand high temperatures without corroding. Now, researchers at Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, have hailed a major breakthrough in understanding how alloys behave at high temperatures, pointing the way to significant improvements in many technologies. The results are published in the highly ranked journal Nature Materials. Developing alloys that can withstand high temperatures without corroding is a key challenge for many fields, such as renewable and sustainable energy technologies like concentrated solar power and solid oxide fuel cells, as well as aviation, materials processing and petrochemistry. At high temperatures, alloys can react violently with their environment, quickly causing the materials to fail by corrosion. To protect against this, all high temperature alloys are designed to form a protective oxide scale, usually consisting of aluminium oxide or chromium oxide."</em> <a href="http://www.mynewsdesk.com/uk/chalmers/pressreleases/ground-breaking-discoveries-could-create-superior-alloys-with-many-applications-2546991">[...]</a>

These performance increases could enable more cost-effective and practical uses for thermoelectrics, with wider industry adoption, to improve fuel economy in vehicles, make power plants more efficient, and advance body heat–powered technologies for watches and smartphones. Thermoelectric materials, typically metal compounds, can convert heat to electricity and vice versa in the presence of a temperature gradient, making them ideal for applications in waste heat recovery. Thermoelectrics could capitalize on enormous amounts of unused waste heat produced by industrial operations, fossil-fuel power generation, commercial buildings, vehicles, and even people by converting that “lost” heat into useable energy. But so far their application has been limited to add-on technologies due to their low efficiency compared with conventional forms of energy generation. To reach benchmarks set for standalone thermo-powered devices, scientists are now looking deeper—down to the atoms—into promising materials and methods to raise efficiency scores."</em> <a href="https://neutrons.ornl.gov/content/scientists-use-neutrons-take-deeper-look-record-boost-thermoelectric-efficiency">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The way that electrons paired as composite particles or arranged in lines interact with each other within a semiconductor provides new design opportunities for electronics, according to recent findings in Nature Communications. What this means for semiconductor components, such as those that send information throughout electronic devices, is not yet clear, but hydrostatic pressure can be used to tune the interaction so that electrons paired as composite particles switch between paired, or "superconductor-like," and lined-up, or "nematic," phases. Forcing these phases to interact also suggests that they can influence each other's properties, like stability – opening up possibilities for manipulation in electronic devices and quantum computing. "You can literally have hundreds of different phases of electrons organizing themselves in different ways in a semiconductor," said Gábor Csáthy, Purdue professor of physics and astronomy. "We found that two in particular can actually talk to each other in the presence of hydrostatic pressure." Csáthy's group discovered that hydrostatic pressure, which is 10,000 times stronger than ambient pressure, compresses the lattice of atoms in a semiconductor and, therefore, influences the electron arrangement within a two-dimensional electron gas hosted by the semiconductor."</em> <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2018/Q2/interaction-of-paired-and-lined-up-electrons-can-be-manipulated-in-semiconductors.html">[...]</a>

Previously, such spontaneous oxidation was considered detrimental because it degrades the MXene structure. The research is published in the June 2018 issue of ACS Nano, one of Google Scholar’s top-rated, peer-reviewed scientific journals. “Now we’ve demonstrated that partial spontaneous oxidation of MXenes into titanium oxide that is integrated with the MXene flakes, can be harnessed to inexpensively manufacture useful MXene-titania nanocomposites,” says Dr. Vadym Mochalin, associate professor of chemistry at Missouri University of Science and Technology and principal investigator of the research. “With the exponential increase in MXenes’ research over the past several years, conceptual discoveries are becoming less frequent,” says Mochalin. “In parallel, researchers delve deeper into MXenes’ fundamental properties, in particular, the complicated chemistry of these materials.” MXenes are two-dimensional inorganic compounds that consist of a few atoms-thick layers of metal carbides and nitrides that possess high electrical conductivity along with hydrophilicity, non-linear optical and tunable electronic properties."</em> <a href="https://news.mst.edu/2018/06/not-always-bad-mxenes-spontaneous-oxidation-harnessed-to-create-2-d-nanocomposites/">[...]</a>

Researchers at MIT, who last year designed a tiny computer chip tailored to help honeybee-sized drones navigate, have now shrunk their chip design even further, in both size and power consumption. The team, co-led by Vivienne Sze, associate professor in MIT's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), and Sertac Karaman, the Class of 1948 Career Development Associate Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics, built a fully customized chip from the ground up, with a focus on reducing power consumption and size while also increasing processing speed. The new computer chip, named “Navion,” which they are presenting this week at the Symposia on VLSI Technology and Circuits, is just 20 square millimeters — about the size of a LEGO minifigure’s footprint — and consumes just 24 milliwatts of power, or about 1 one-thousandth the energy required to power a lightbulb. Using this tiny amount of power, the chip is able to process in real-time camera images at up to 171 frames per second, as well as inertial measurements, both of which it uses to determine where it is in space.

Researchers from Hokkaido University and their colleagues in Japan and Taiwan have improved the ability to transform wasted heat into usable electricity by significantly narrowing the space through which spread electrons move, according to a new study published in the journal Nature Communications. More than 60 percent of energy produced by fossil fuels is lost as waste heat. One way to address this problem is to convert the wasted heat into electricity, known as thermoelectric energy conversion. However, improving the conversion rate has been difficult because of a trade-off relationship between the required properties within the material.

The Five Finger Code Finder is an electromechanical device and software designed to efficiently find the PIN code that will unlock Ford automobiles equipped with a 5 button entry keypad.Its purpose is to demonstrate how the design of this system allows PIN codes to be found in a MUCH SHORTER TIME than would normally be required to brute force search and try all possible PINs. This system allows a good level of usability but in the process sacrifices security. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how design decisions that put a priority on ease of use can greatly compromise the security of a system such as this.The system uses an Arduino for control, a standard HD44780 compatible LCD, and five solenoids to press the keypad buttons in sequence. DETAILS This project builds on the previous work of Samy Kamkar and the authors of “The Car Hacking Handbook.” Samy discovered a method to quickly open garage door openers that use a remote with a fixed binary code set by dip switches. Despite the development of rather secure rolling code systems these remotes are still in wide use in situations such as apartment parking garages where a large number of remotes must operate the same door."</em> <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/27445-five-finger-code-finder">[...]</a>

For good reason too, with a single pin from any popular microcontroller Adafruit makes adding gorgeous LEDs and animations to any project extremely easy. Unfortunately they are rather expensive, and Adafruit only sells four sizes. What many makers don't realize is NeoPixel is simply Adafruit's branding of a few identical LED chips named WS2812, WS2811 and SK6812 respectively. All Adafruit does it take the chip and put it on a circuit board, charging a hefty premium alongside. There is nothing wrong with Adafruit doing this as it makes NeoPixels accessible to everyone, but if one were to simply make the boards themselves one could make custom shapes of any size or design for around 15% of the cost of Adafruit's models (for a 24 LED ring)($3)."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Custom-NeoPixel-Rings-From-Scratch/">[...]</a>

Then I bended a metal wire into a circle and I placed the 12 LED in the correct polarity, I glued them in place and added a second wire circle slightly smaller than the first one, I also glued it to LED, then I connected the 12 LED together: 3 groups in parallel with 4 LED each, and the two wires of the ring are the positive and negative.

Uploading files on the SPIFFS of the ESP8266 to use those file more efficiently in our arduino code."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Controlling-7-Segment-LED-Display-Using-ESP8266-We/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This project demonstrates the basics of digital logic, the characteristics of a NE555 timer, and demonstrates how binary numbers are counted. The components used are: a NE555 timer, a 12-bit ripple counter, two 2-input NOR gates, a 4-input AND gate, a 2-input AND gate, and a 2-input OR gate. The logic gates, NOR, AND, and OR come in TTL and CMOS equivalents which can be found at Lees Electronic. This project is a simple egg timer with two settings: hard or soft boiled and comes with a reset function.
