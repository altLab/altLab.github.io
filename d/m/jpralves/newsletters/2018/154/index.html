<p>Faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1851, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Walter_Maunder">Edward Walter Maunder</a>. Este astrónomo inglês que foi o primeiro a fazer o exame da Comissão do Serviço Civil Britânico para o posto de assistente fotográfico e espectroscópio no Royal Observatory, em Greenwich. Nos quarenta anos seguintes em que trabalhou lá, fez extensas medições de manchas solares. Verificando registos históricos, ele encontrou um período de 1645 a 1715 que teve uma notável falta de relatórios sobre manchas solares. Embora ele podia ter questionado a exactidão do relatório, ele atribuiu a escassez de relatórios a uma escassez real de manchas solares durante esse período. Embora a sua sugestão não tenha sido geralmente aceita num primeiro momento, com o acumular de pesquisas indicou que há de fato décadas de duração quando o sol tem notavelmente poucas manchas solares. Esses períodos são agora conhecidos como minima Maunder .</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1852, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_von_Lindemann">Ferdinand von Lindemann</a>. Este matemático alemão foi o primeiro a provar que PI é transcendental (não é uma solução de qualquer equação algébrica com coeficientes racionais). Isso finalmente estabeleceu a natureza insolúvel do problema matemático grego clássico de enquadrar o círculo (construindo um quadrado com a mesma área que um dado círculo usando somente régua e compasso.) Em 1873, Lindemann visitou Hermite em Paris e discutiu os métodos que Hermite havia usado. usado em sua prova de que e, a base dos logaritmos naturais, é transcendental. Após essa visita, Lindemann conseguiu estender os resultados de Hermite para mostrar que PI também era transcendental (1882).</p>

<p>Por fim anos hoje que nascia, em 1872, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Urbain">Georges Urbain</a>. Este químico francês foi o primeiro que isolou o lutécio, o último dos materiais raros estáveis. Entre 1895 e 1912 trabalhou materiais raros e realizou mais de 200.000 destilações fraccionadas nas quais separou os elementos samário, európio, gadolínio, térbio, disprósio e hólmio. Em 1907, ele descreveu um processo pelo qual o itérbio de Marignac (1879) poderia ser separado em dois elementos, itérbio (neoytterbium) e lutécio. Ele deu o nome da vila da era romana do que ficava no local de Paris, sua cidade natal ao novo elemento. (Foi descoberto independentemente por von Welsbach mais ou menos na mesma época.) Urbain também descobriu a lei da fosforescência óptima de sistemas binários e escreveu sobre o isomorfismo.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que foi criada uma nova versão do formato de imagens JPEG. Designado por JPEG XS, as imagens e vídeos mantêm um nível extremamente alto de qualidade graças a um processo de compactação mais simples e rápido - e, portanto, mais eficiente em termos de energia. Os arquivos compactados acabam por ser maiores, mas isso não é um problema graças às redes de banda larga, como Wi-Fi e 5G: o objectivo é transmitir os arquivos em vez de armazená-los em smartphones ou outros dispositivos com memória limitada. Isto vem igualmente resolver o problema que os utilizadores têm com os headsets de realidade virtual que os deixam com náuseas? Um dos motivos é a latência ou a quantidade quase imperceptível de tempo que uma imagem leva para mudar em resposta ao movimento da cabeça de um utilizador. Com este novo padrão de compressão de imagens que poderá resolver esse problema.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como um modelo completo de estação meteorológica para ser impressa em 3D. É apresentada a revista newelectronics de 10 de Abril e alguns livros escritos por Sir Clive Sinclair sobre a temática de transístores. É igualmente apresentado um livro da Analog Devices sobre desenho de Amplificadores para Instrumentação.</p>

<p><em>"Why do virtual reality headsets make users nauseous? One reason is latency, or the almost imperceptible amount of time it takes for a display image to change in response to a user’s head movement. However, the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) has just introduced a new image compression standard that could resolve this problem. This working group is headed by Touradj Ebrahimi, a professor in EPFL’s School of Engineering (STI). With JPEG XS, images and videos maintain an extremely high level of quality thanks to a compression process that is simpler and faster – and thus more energy efficient. The compressed files end up being larger, but that’s not a problem thanks to broadband networks such as Wi-Fi and 5G: the aim is to stream the files instead of storing them in smartphones or other devices with limited memory."</em> <a href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/a-new-jpeg-format-for-virtual-reality-drones-and-s/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"For the BionicFlyingFox, our developers from the Bionic Learning Network took a close look at the flying fox and technically implemented its special flying characteristics. Due to the combination of the integrated on-board electronics with an external motion-tracking system, the ultra-lightweight flying object is able to move semi-autonomously in a defined airspace. The flying fox belongs to the order Chiroptera – the only mammals that can actively fly. A particular characteristic is their fine elastic flying membrane that stretches from the extended metacarpal and finger bones down to the foot joints. In flight, the animals control the curvature of the flying membrane with their fingers, allowing them to move aerodynamically and agilely through the air. They thereby achieve maximum uplift, even when performing slow flying manoeuvres."</em> <a href="https://www.festo.com/group/en/cms/13130.htm">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Microsemi Corporation (Nasdaq: MSCC), a leading provider of semiconductor solutions differentiated by power, security, reliability and performance, today announced its first cost-optimized, low power, mid-range PolarFire™ field programmable gate array (FPGA) device is now production-qualified. With 300K logic elements (LEs), the second largest device in the family targets a variety of applications in the communications, defense, industrial and aviation markets. The company also announced full Libero SoC Design Suite support for PolarFire devices, giving designers the ability to design in any member of the family. PolarFire FPGAs have now been adopted by dozens of customers in key communications, defense and industrial infrastructure market segments, and early access customers are moving into early production qualification with the family. These systems have a substantially lower cost of ownership, as the PolarFire family enables significantly lower power consumption and an ability to operate in harsher thermal environments. "With the first award-winning PolarFire device production-qualified, current customers can now release their end products into the market and new customers can start their PolarFire designs with the assurance they are utilizing an FPGA family that has gone through a robust qualification regimen, completing thousands of man hours of testing and validation," said Suresh Menon, vice president of engineering at Microsemi."</em> <a href="https://investor.microsemi.com/2018-04-11-Microsemi-Reaches-Key-Production-Qualification-Milestone-for-its-Award-Winning-PolarFire-FPGA-Family">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Twenty-four EU countries pledged to band together to form a “European approach” to artificial intelligence in a bid to compete with American and Asian tech giants. Ministers signed a declaration on Tuesday (10 April) saying they will consider putting public research funding into AI, but did not promise a specific amount of dedicated new investments. All EU member states except for Cyprus, Romania, Croatia and Greece vowed to “modernise national policies” as part of an effort to develop large-scale AI research. One Commission official said the four EU countries that did not sign were not opposed to the initiative but might still need formal approval before signing. Norway also signed the declaration. European politicians are scrambling to amp up their work on AI by earmarking public funds and nudging companies to invest in technologies like robotics and medical applications that process huge amounts of data."</em> <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/twenty-four-eu-countries-sign-artificial-intelligence-pact-in-bid-to-compete-with-us-china/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scientists working on NASA's Juno mission to Jupiter shared a 3-D infrared movie depicting densely packed cyclones and anticyclones that permeate the planet's polar regions, and the first detailed view of a dynamo, or engine, powering the magnetic field for any planet beyond Earth. Those are among the items unveiled during the European Geosciences Union General Assembly in Vienna, Austria, on Wednesday, April 11. Juno mission scientists have taken data collected by the spacecraft's Jovian InfraRed Auroral Mapper (JIRAM) instrument and generated the 3-D fly-around of the Jovian world's north pole. Imaging in the infrared part of the spectrum, JIRAM captures light emerging from deep inside Jupiter equally well, night or day. The instrument probes the weather layer down to 30 to 45 miles (50 to 70 kilometers) below Jupiter's cloud tops. The imagery will help the team understand the forces at work in the animation - a north pole dominated by a central cyclone surrounded by eight circumpolar cyclones with diameters ranging from 2,500 to 2,900 miles (4,000 to 4,600 kilometers)."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7096">[...]</a>

MIT researchers have developed a computer interface that can transcribe words that the user verbalizes internally but does not actually speak aloud. The system consists of a wearable device and an associated computing system. Electrodes in the device pick up neuromuscular signals in the jaw and face that are triggered by internal verbalizations — saying words “in your head” — but are undetectable to the human eye. The signals are fed to a machine-learning system that has been trained to correlate particular signals with particular words.

<h2><a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/channels/channels/news/linking-localized-corrosion-stainless-steel-titanium-286346">Linking Localized Corrosion of Stainless Steel to Titanium</a></h2>

<p><em>"McGill University researchers have discovered the consequence of adding titanium and other stabilizing agents to high performing stainless steel on the material’s localized corrosion mechanism. In a study published in npj Materials Degradation, the researchers describe a suite of electrochemical techniques used to characterize the material’s corrosion properties both on the macro and micro scale. Despite the material’s reputation of providing high corrosion resistance, stainless steels are notorious for undergoing localized corrosion- where local breakdown becomes detrimental to the object’s structural integrity due to the formation of pits and crevices that penetrate through the entire metallic object with minimal amount of material lost. Gaining mechanistic insight on how a material will eventually fail over a lab-friendly time scale is thus extremely useful before implementing them in corrosive environments for long-term applications. The work was published in the nature partnered journal, performed by graduate student, Samantha Gateman, and led by the senior author, McGill’s chemistry professor Janine Mauzeroll. It demonstrates the power of pairing microscopy techniques in order to investigate relevant industrial material and will bench mark the characterization methods used in corrosion literature to investigate stainless steel’s corrosion behavior."</em> <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/channels/channels/news/linking-localized-corrosion-stainless-steel-titanium-286346">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers at Purdue University and Stanford University believe they have found a novel laser light sensing technology that is more robust and less expensive than currently available with a wide range of uses, including a way to guide fully autonomous vehicles. The researchers say their innovation is orders of magnitude faster than conventional leading-edge laser beam steering devices that use phased antenna-array technology. The laser beam steering being tested and used by Purdue and Stanford is based on light-matter interaction between a silicon-based metasurface and short light pulses produced for example by a mode-locked laser with a frequency-comb spectrum. Such a beam-steering device can scan a large angle of view in nanoseconds or picoseconds compared with the microseconds current technology takes. “This technology is far less complex and uses less power than existing technologies,” said Amr Shaltout, a post-doctoral research fellow in Materials Science and Engineering at Stanford who conceived the idea for the method. “The technology merges two different fields of nanophotonic metasurfaces and ultrafast optics.” Laser beam steering is a vital technology that can be used in a wide variety of areas including navigation, space flights, radar applications, imaging, tag-scanners, robotics, archaeology, mapping and atmospheric physics."</em> <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2018/Q2/researchers-at-purdue,-stanford-devise-novel-ultrafast-laser-beam-steering-for-autonomous-cars-that-is-less-complex,-uses-less-power.html">[...]</a>

At the same time the electrons' energies were seen to be modulated along each bunch. These results are the experimental proof of a novel plasma acceleration concept pursued by the AWAKE (Advanced Wakefield Experiment) collaboration at the European particle physics lab CERN in Geneva. The team led by DESY scientist Matthias Groß presents its findings in the journal Physical Review Letters.

The Haber-Bosch process developed in the early 1900s for producing ammonia relies on non-renewable fossil fuels and has limited applications for only large, centralized chemical plants. The new process, published in Nature Catalysis, utilizes a plasma — an ionized gas — in combination with non-noble metal catalysts to generate ammonia at much milder conditions than is possible with Haber-Bosch. The energy in the plasma excites nitrogen molecules, one of the two components that go into making ammonia, allowing them to react more readily on the catalysts. Because the energy for the reaction comes from the plasma rather than high heat and intense pressure, the process can be carried out at small scale. This makes the new process well-suited for use with intermittent renewable energy sources and for distributed ammonia production."</em> <a href="https://research.nd.edu/news/notre-dame-researchers-developing-renewable-energy-approach-for-producing-ammonia/">[...]</a>

Scientists from the theoretical nanophotonics team led by Skoltech Professor Nikolay Gippius jointly with researchers from Moscow State University and the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm demonstrated, first theoretically and then experimentally, that gold nanostripes are capable of changing the extinction and photoluminescence spectra of silicon nanocrystals. They established that the nanostripe width also affects the optical properties of the quantum dots."</em> <a href="https://www.skoltech.ru/en/2018/04/gold-changes-the-photoluminescence-of-silicon-quantum-dots/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Startup’s optoelectronic chips could reduce energy usage by up to 50 percent in data centers while increasing computing speeds. With novel optoelectronic chips and a new partnership with a top silicon-chip manufacturer, MIT spinout Ayar Labs aims to increase speed and reduce energy consumption in computing, starting with data centers. Backed by years of research at MIT and elsewhere, Ayar has developed chips that move data around with light but compute electronically. The unique design integrates speedy, efficient optical communications — with components that transmit data using light waves — into traditional computer chips, replacing less efficient copper wires. According to the startup, the chips can reduce energy usage by about 95 percent in chip-to-chip communications and increase bandwidth tenfold over their copper-based counterparts. In massive data centers — Ayar’s first target application — run by tech giants such as Facebook and Amazon, the chips could cut total energy usage by 30 to 50 percent, says CEO Alex Wright-Gladstein MBA ’15."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2018/startup-ayar-labs-optoelectronic-computer-chips-0406">[...]</a>

Their advance could enable a wide variety of commercial applications. For example, integrating thermoelectric generating devices into computer chips could enable the heat they produce to provide a power source. Waste heat from automobile engines could run a car’s electronics and provide cooling. Photovoltaic solar cells could be made more efficient by harnessing the heat from sunlight striking them to generate more electricity.

While many theoretical approaches to engineer such a device have been proposed, they have struggled to simultaneously control both the transmission and reflection of sound in exactly the desired manner, and none have been experimentally demonstrated. The new design is the first to demonstrate complete, near-perfect control of sound waves and is quickly and easily fabricated using 3-D printers. The results appear online April 9 in Nature Communications. “Controlling the transmission and reflection of sound waves this way was a theoretical concept that did not have a path to implementation—nobody knew how to design a practical structure using these ideas,” said Steve Cummer, professor of electrical and computer engineering at Duke. “We solved both of those problems."</em> <a href="http://pratt.duke.edu/about/news/sound-control">[...]</a>

The electrolyte, one of three main parts of a battery, is responsible for transferring charged ions in a solid-state battery. This creates an electrical current once the other two parts of the battery, the anode and cathode, are connected in a circuit.

<p><em>"Well... I bought an Arduino. Initially, the investment was motivated with something that would make my daughter interested in programming. However, as it turned out, this thing was more fun to play with for me.After playing around with making LED's light up, button interaction and serial printing, I decided to set raise the bar a bit and actually make something. As one of my biggest interests is gaming it was naturally going to be something gaming-related, and therefore I decided to create my own little arcade machine. I quickly realized that the actual cabinet-building had to be a future project, and that I needed to focus on wrapping my head around programming with the limited resources that Arduino has to offer."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Snake-on-a-VGA-Monitor/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In developing an OLED ID Tag, I needed to make my design as energy efficient as possible. One approach was to only display the tag if there was someone nearby (think ComiCon or Exhibition booths). The sensors themselves can draw a lot of current, so this needed to be optimized. Originally I started with a Sharp IR sensor, but bricked my only one during a development spike. I believe there are many scenarios where low power sensing is required, so I made the design fairly generic where the hardware sensor and the associated code could be swapped out easily. Also serial pins (TX/RX) have been broken out so as to debug the ATTINY85 during development."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/IOT123-SR04-DISTANCE-TRIGGER-BRICK/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The IR Remote Control Detective decodes the signal from several common types of infrared remote control, such as audio, TV, and hobbyist remote controls. To use it you point a remote control at the receiver and press a key; it will then identify the protocol, and display the address and command corresponding to the key: It's based on an ATtiny85, an infrared receiver, and a 128x32 I2C OLED display. I originally built it to help design a project based on an IR remote control. It will be useful if you're trying to automate the control of an existing domestic device using its infrared remote control codes, or you want to make a device you can control with an existing remote control. Once you've used the IR Remote Control Detective to find out what codes your remote control generates you could use it to control your own project using the receive routine in this program. You could also build a replacement remote control to control your equipment using the transmit routines in my earlier articles: IR Remote Control Tool, IR Remote Control Tool (NEC), or Sony NEX/Alpha Remote Control."</em> <a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?24A9">[...]</a>

I also wanted to have a unique modular keyboard, where I could grab any parts that I needed, this is the first of many other parts.
