<p>Faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1622, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincenzo_Viviani">Vincenzo Viviani</a>. Este matemático italiano foi líder em seu campo e fundou a Accademia del Cimento. Como uma das primeiras sociedades científicas importantes, esta organização foi criada antes da Royal Society da Inglaterra. Em 1639, aos 17 anos, tornou-se aluno, secretário e assistente de Galileu em Arcetri, até a morte de Galileu, em 1642. Durante sua longa carreira, Viviani publicou vários livros sobre assuntos matemáticos e científicos. Ele editou a primeira edição das obras unificadas de Galileu (1655-1656) e trabalhou incansavelmente para reabilitar a memória do seu mestre. Em 1660, junto com Borelli, ele mediu a velocidade do som ao sincronizar a diferença entre o flash e o som de um canhão. Eles obtiveram o valor de 350 metros por segundo. Ficou igualmente conhecido pelo teorema de Viviani, que estabelece que a soma das distancias de um ponto interior aos lados, num ângulo recto, de um triângulo equilátero é igual ao comprimento da altura do triângulo.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1827, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Lister,_1st_Baron_Lister">Joseph Lister</a>. Este cirurgião inglês e cientista médico foi o fundador da medicina anti-séptica e um pioneiro na medicina preventiva. Influenciado pela teoria dos germes de Louis Pasteur, Lister resolveu manter esses organismos longe das feridas. O seu livro, sobre o Princípio Anti-séptico na Prática da Cirurgia (1867), foi o primeiro tratado sobre o assunto. Enquanto na Royal Infirmary, Glasgow, Escócia, ele introduziu o uso do fenol como um desinfectante usado em ligaduras, utensílios, bem como para uso directo em feridas e lavagem das mãos do cirurgião. A sua primeira cirurgia foi realizada em 12 de Agosto de 1865. A prática médica moderna continua a seguir o princípio de Lister de que as feridas devem ser mantidas livres de bactérias, embora a esterilização tenha substituído o uso mais anticéptico.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1892, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Kemper">Hermann Kemper</a>. Este engenheiro alemão foi um pioneiro na levitação magnética. Kemper começou a sua pesquisa sobre levitação magnética em 1922. Em 1933, construiu um circuito funcional para pairar sobre o princípio da levitação electromagnética, usando a atracão electromagnética. Ele recebeu o número de Patente do Reich 643316, "Schwebebahn mit räderlosen Fahrzeugen, die an eisernen fahrschienen mittels magnetischer Felder schwebend entlang geführt wird" (a invenção de um hovertrack com veículos sem chumbo que pairam ao longo de trilhos de ferro usando campos magnéticos). Esta invenção acabou por levar ao desenvolvimento do Transrapid.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1894, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Dale_Bell">Lawrence Dale Bell</a>. Este fabricante e projectista de aviões americanos, fundador da Bell Aircraft Co., cujo avião experimental X-1, lançado em 1947, foi o primeiro a quebrar a barreira do som. Esta empresa também produziu contribuições significativas para a aviação, como o primeiro avião a jacto do país, o primeiro helicóptero comercial do mundo, o avião voador mais rápido e mais alto do mundo, o Bell X-1A, e o primeiro jato vertical de descolagem e pouso.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1918, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Sobek">Joseph Sobek</a>. Este inventor americano ficou conhecido pela invenção do Raquetebol que desenvolveu o desporto (1950) para jogar no Greenwich, Connecticut, YMCA. Como um profissional de squash e tênis por sete anos, ele inventou o Raquetebol como um desporto de raquetes indoor alternativo. Ele elaborou regras, desenhou um projecto de raquete, que foi criado em 1951 pela Magnan Racket Manufacturing Company. Para promover a sua invenção, ele fundou a Paddle Rackets Association com um grupo de jogadores. Ele se retirou da promoção activa quando o desporto rapidamente ganhou popularidade, como uma actividade desportiva que era fácil de aprender e que não precisava de força para desfrutar.</p>

<p>Esta semana que passou Linus Torvalds lançou o Linux 4.16. Esta versão foi um lançamento de peso com melhorias e correcções para várias arquitecturas, drivers, etc. Muito trabalho foi feito para aumentar a segurança com a ajuda de correcções de Specter e Meltdown e limpezas de código. No campo do suporte de CPUs, varias melhorias foram feitas para oferecer suporte a recursos mais recentes. Houve actualizações do RISC-V, suporte do KVM para o AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization, assim como o driver Oracle DAX, etc. Foi desenvolvido trabalho também para melhorar o suporte para gráficos Cannonlake Gen 10, no Jetson TX2 e melhorias no AMDKFD.</p>

<p>Ficámos também a saber que a NASA contratou a Lockeed-Martin para desenvolver um novo avião supersónico. O contrato prevê o desenho, a construção e os testes do chamado "Low-Boom Flight Demonstrator". Este avião deverá  ter a capacidade de transportar passageiros e deverá ter um ruído supersónico que permita ser aceite com os regulamentos em vigor. A aeronave será construída nas instalações da Lockheed Martin Skunk Works em Palmdale, Califórnia, e deverá fazer o seu primeiro voo em 2021.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. É apresentado o livro CircuitPython Essentials, assim como a revista newelectronics de 27 de Março.</p>

<p><em>"I guess Linus Torvalds doesn’t like to make tons of jokes. That’s why after shipping seven release candidates for Linux kernel 4.16, he decided to released the final kernel on April Fools’ Day. He might have shipped RC8 just for the heck of it, with no changes, but that’s not his style. At the time of RC7 release, he called it a bigger release than usual. About half of the code update was networking. The final release looks a lot like RC7."</em> <a href="https://fossbytes.com/linux-kernel-4-16-released-features-download/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Supersonic commercial travel is on the horizon. Today NASA awarded Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) Skunk Works® a contract to design, build and flight test the Low-Boom Flight Demonstrator, an X-plane designed to make supersonic passenger air travel a reality. "It is super exciting to be back designing and flying X-planes at this scale," said Jaiwon Shin, NASA's associate administrator for aeronautics. "Our long tradition of solving the technical barriers of supersonic flight to benefit everyone continues." Lockheed Martin Skunk Works will build a full-scale experimental aircraft, known as an X-plane, of its preliminary design developed under NASA's Quiet Supersonic Technology (QueSST) effort. The X-plane will help NASA establish an acceptable commercial supersonic noise standard to overturn current regulations banning commercial supersonic travel over land."</em> <a href="https://news.lockheedmartin.com/2018-04-03-NASA-Selects-Lockheed-Martin-Skunk-Works-R-to-Build-X-Plane">[...]</a>

<p><em>"SpaceX has successfully launched its Iridium -5 mission, which carries 10 satellites to add to Iridium’s NEXT global communications constellation. This is the fifth set of 10, out of a total of 75 that SpaceX is launching for client Iridium, and today’s launch used a first stage Falcon 9 booster originally employed last October for the third Iridium NEXT satellite launch. The launch included reuse of a flight proven rocket, but it did not include a recovery attempt for the first stage booster this time around. SpaceX attempted to recover one half of the fairing used during the launch, which is the protective metal shielding that covers the cargo as the rocket blasts through the atmosphere en route to space. The fairing alone is worth around $6 million, and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has indicated that it would be relatively easy to refurbish this part for repeat flight, provided their recovery plan works. SpaceX was once again unsuccessful in recovering the fairing, per Musk."</em> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/30/spacex-successfully-launches-iridium-5-falcon-9-mission/">[...]</a>

<p><em>" The top U.S. telecommunications regulator on Thursday gave formal approval to a plan by Elon Musk’s SpaceX to build a global broadband network using satellites. “This is the first approval of a U.S.-licensed satellite constellation to provide broadband services using a new generation of low-Earth orbit satellite technologies,” the Federal Communications Commission said in a statement. The system proposed by privately held SpaceX, as Space Exploration Holdings is known, will use 4,425 satellites, the FCC said. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai in February had endorsed the SpaceX effort, saying: “Satellite technology can help reach Americans who live in rural or hard-to-serve places where fiber optic cables and cell towers do not reach.” The Federal Aviation Administration said on Wednesday that SpaceX plans to launch a Falcon 9 rocket on April 2 at Cape Canaveral, Florida. “The rocket will carry a communications satellite,” the FAA said. The FCC said SpaceX has been granted authority to use frequencies in the Ka (20/30 GHz) and Ku (11/14 GHz) bands."</em> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spacex-fcc/u-s-regulator-approves-spacex-plan-for-broadband-satellite-services-idUSKBN1H537E">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/about/media-center/press-item.html/n4032.html">Innovative Low-Dropout Voltage Regulator from STMicroelectronics Packs Big Performance in Tiny Footprint</a></h2>

<p><em>"STMicroelectronics’ STLQ020 low-dropout (LDO) voltage regulator relieves the familiar trade-offs between quiescent current, output power, dynamic response, and package size, to give designers extra freedom. By combining small size with high performance and energy efficiency, the STLQ020 is ideal for use in battery-powered consumer products like smartphones and tablets, smart watches, audio or media devices, and wearables. It helps extend battery life in IoT endpoints such as smart meters and wireless sensors, healthcare devices like wearable monitors, and industrial applications such as factory automation or sensor networking. Drawing just 300nA quiescent current (Iq), and capable of supplying up to 200mA to the load with excellent regulation, power-supply rejection (PSRR), and transient response, the STLQ020 is available in a choice of compact packages reaching as small as a 0.8mm x 0.8mm flip-chip4. This unique combination of attributes stems from the STLQ020’s dedicated low-power design and adaptive bias circuitry, which ensures fast response and a stable output with high PSRR. In addition, dropout voltage as low as 160mV (typical) at maximum load allows longer equipment runtimes as the battery discharges."</em> <a href="http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/about/media-center/press-item.html/n4032.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"CMU Researchers Foresee Machines Capable of On-Demand Knitting Carnegie Mellon University computer scientists have developed a system that can translate a wide variety of 3-D shapes into stitch-by-stitch instructions that enable a computer-controlled knitting machine to automatically produce those shapes. Researchers in the Carnegie Mellon Textiles Lab have used the system to produce a variety of plush toys and garments. What's more, this ability to generate knitting instructions without need of human expertise could make on-demand machine knitting possible, according to James McCann, assistant professor in the Robotics Institute and leader of the lab. McCann's vision is to use the same machines that routinely crank out thousands of knitted hats, gloves and other apparel to produce customized pieces one at a time or in small quantities. Gloves, for instance, might be designed to precisely fit a customer's hands. Athletic shoe uppers, sweaters and hats might have unique color patterns or ornamentation."</em> <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/news/software-automatically-generates-knitting-instructions-3-d-shapes">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Electric vehicles may one day be able to recharge while driving down the highway, drawing wireless power directly from plates installed in the road that would make it possible to drive hundreds—if not thousands—of miles without having to plug in. While the idea may sound like science fiction, CU Boulder engineers are working to bring it closer to reality. “We’d like to enable electric vehicles to charge on the go,” said Khurram Afridi, an assistant professor in CU Boulder’s Department of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering. Over the last two years, Afridi and his colleagues have developed a proof of concept for wireless power transfer that transfers electrical energy through electric fields at very high frequencies. The ability to send large amounts of energy across greater physical distance to in-motion platforms from low cost charging plates could one day allow the technology to expand beyond small consumer electronics like cell phones and begin powering bigger things like automobiles. Currently, most electric vehicles can travel between 100 and 250 miles on a single charge, depending on the make and model."</em> <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/today/2018/03/27/future-electric-cars-could-recharge-wirelessly-while-you-drive">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Technique could prevent overheating of laptops, mobile phones, and other electronics. Plastics are excellent insulators, meaning they can efficiently trap heat — a quality that can be an advantage in something like a coffee cup sleeve. But this insulating property is less desirable in products such as plastic casings for laptops and mobile phones, which can overheat, in part because the coverings trap the heat that the devices produce. Now a team of engineers at MIT has developed a polymer thermal conductor — a plastic material that, however counterintuitively, works as a heat conductor, dissipating heat rather than insulating it. The new polymers, which are lightweight and flexible, can conduct 10 times as much heat as most commercially used polymers. “Traditional polymers are both electrically and thermally insulating."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2018/engineers-turn-plastic-insulator-heat-conductor-0330">[...]</a>

<p><em>"For the first time, researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) have successfully 3D-printed optical-quality glasses, on par with commercial glass products currently available on the market. In a study published in the journal Advanced Materials Technologies (link is external), LLNL scientists and engineers describe successfully printing small test pieces from Lab-developed ink with properties “within range of commercial optical grade glasses.” Because the refractive index of glass is sensitive to its thermal history, it can be difficult to ensure that glass printed from the molten phase will result in the desired optical performance, researchers said. Depositing the LLNL-developed material in paste form and then heating the entire print to form the glass allows for a uniform refractive index, eliminating optical distortion that would degrade the optic's function. "Components printed from molten glass often show texture from the 3D-printing process, and even if you were to polish the surface, you would still see evidence of the printing process within the bulk material,” said LLNL chemical engineer Rebecca Dylla-Spears, the project’s principal investigator. “This approach allows us to obtain the index homogeneity that is needed for optics. Now we can take these components and do something interesting.” The custom inks, aimed at forming silica and silica-titania glasses, allow researchers the ability to tune the glass’s optical, thermal and mechanical properties, Dylla-Spears said."</em> <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/news/lab-scientists-successfully-print-glass-optics">[...]</a>

In a new study, researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory, the University of California-Los Angeles, the University of California-Santa Barbara, Purdue University and the University of Oregon have developed a method to create linked networks of metal oxides that could have interesting catalytic or electronic properties. “If we can stitch in these molecules exactly where we want them to be, it will give us a powerful ability to make and understand hybrid materials with a wide range of uses.” — UCLA chemist Alexander Spokoyny Metal oxides are of interest to scientists because of their unique electronic and chemical properties. Some, like titanium dioxide, are commonly used in photovoltaic and photocatalytic applications because of their ability to absorb light. The key to forming these metal oxide networks is boron, which when annealed with metal oxides leads to the formation of thermally robust and stable interconnected clusters that act as strands of glue that connect a metal oxide web. “This glue has the ability to be a key component of the entire reactive system, changing the properties that the metal oxides had on their own,” said Alexander Spokoyny, a chemist at UCLA."</em> <a href="http://www.anl.gov/articles/what-mesh">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A robust polymer that can be readily repaired unites two properties that seemed mutually exclusive A mechanically robust polymer that can be repaired simply by manually pressing damaged portions together has been developed by researchers at RIKEN and the University of Tokyo1. This finding demonstrates that healing is not limited just to soft materials, and it may lead to display materials that can be fixed rather than replaced. Using durable polymers is important for realizing a sustainable society, but it is typically difficult to repair such mechanically robust polymers when they sustain damage. That is because they are usually made of long, entangled polymer chains, which do not readily diffuse to repair fractures unless the polymer is heated or even melted. Shorter chains that are held together by many hydrogen bonds have been devised, but hydrogen-bonded structures tend to organize into ordered arrays, promoting crystallization and rendering the material brittle. Now, Takuzo Aida from the RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science and his PhD student Yu Yanagisawa at the University of Tokyo, together with their co-workers, have hit on a way to circumvent crystallization by using a polymer made of thiourea units (–NH(C)SNH–), which engage in hydrogen bonding, and ether linkers."</em> <a href="http://www.riken.jp/en/research/rikenresearch/highlights/20180323_0061/">[...]</a>

This would also solve the problem of arranging the LEDs neatly in a matrix with same distances which can be often tricky when connecting them by wires.

This instructable will show you how I build it, because its all standard components, you could design your own version, make the case out of wood, leave the SD out witch will give you 512 bytes of extra sram, add other devices using SPI or I2C, the design is very universal to use and extend.

It's not only a useful waveform generator, but also a good introduction to the composition of musical notes. Introduction Unlike most of my other projects on Technoblogy I didn't originally set out to design this. I got the idea after working out a way to add a sine wave to my original Tiny Function Generator project, realising I could take this one step further and use the same technique to allow you to generate arbitrary waveforms by specifying the amplitude of each of their harmonics. Because I wanted to hear the effect on a waveform of modifying individual harmonics, I also added an audio amplifier and volume control to the design so it will drive a loudspeaker.

<p><em>"8*16 LED matrix display with bluetooth low energy to connect to any smart phone DESCRIPTION “There is only one happiness in life, to love and be loved.” – George Sand This LED matrix is a heart shaped circuit which you can make/buy(from me) and gift to your valentine or crush and spread your love. It can be worn as a necklace or as a badge. It has got BLE so you can display any text message on the necklace using a smart phone. In this project I have shared my personal motivation for making this necklace. DETAILS If you have ever fallen in love then you know how it feels. Your days become nights and the nights become your days."</em> <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/114144-led-ble-hearty-necklacebadge">[...]</a>
