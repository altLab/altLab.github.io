<p>Faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1768, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Donkin">Bryan Donkin</a>. Este engenheiro mecânico e inventor inglês foi responsável pela melhoria do desenho e instalação de uma máquina protótipo para fazer papel em comprimentos contínuos numa fábrica. Em 1808, Donkin adquiriu as obras e uma licença para fabricar as máquinas de fabricação de papel. Ele também desenvolveu máquinas de impressão e inventou o rolo de composição usado na impressão. Donkin detinha outras patentes sobre engrenagens, canetas de aço, fabricação de papel e rodas ferroviárias. Ele também trabalhou na preservação de alimentos em contentores herméticos, contadores de voltas e melhorou as roscas aparafusadas precisas para graduação de escalas matemáticas.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1788, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Joseph_Pelletier">Pierre Joseph Pelletier</a>. Este químico francês é conhecido pela sua pesquisa em parceria com Joseph-Bienaimé Caventou em bases vegetais e as contribuições resultantes da química alcaloide para o campo da medicina. Eles contribuíram para a química dos alcaloides vegetais. Eles isolaram a clorofila, para a qual cunharam o nome francês clorofila em Ann. de Chimie (1818), IX, 195. As suas descobertas de alcaloides incluíram estricnina (1818), brucina (1819), quinina (1820), cafeína (1821) e cinchonina. Em 1823, usando análises elementares de tubo fechado, em que os alcaloides foram queimados, descobriram que o nitrogénio estava presente nos compostos. Os alcaloides são compostos orgânicos que formam sais hidro-solúveis que desempenham várias funções na medicina, incluindo analgésicos e estimulantes respiratórios.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1799, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Wilhelm_Argelander">Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander</a>. Este astrónomo alemão estabeleceu o estudo de estrelas variáveis como um ramo independente da astronomia e é conhecido pelo seu grande catálogo listando as posições e o brilho de 324.188 estrelas do hemisfério norte acima da nona magnitude. Ele estudou na Universidade de Königsberg, na Prússia, onde foi aluno e depois o sucessor de Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel. Em 1837, Argelander publicou a primeira grande investigação do movimento do Sol através do espaço. Em 1844 ele começou estudos de estrelas variáveis.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1868, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Andrews_Millikan">Robert Andrews Millikan</a>. Este físico norte-americano recebeu o Prémio Nobel da Física em 1923 pelo seu trabalho sobre a carga elementar de electricidade e sobre o efeito fotoeléctrico. A famosa experiência de gota de óleo de Millikan (1911) foi muito superior às determinações anteriores da carga de um electrão, e ainda mostrou que o electrão era uma partícula discreta e fundamental. Quando o seu valor foi substituído na fórmula teórica de Niels Bohr para o espectro de hidrogénio, essa teoria foi validada pelos resultados experimentais. Assim, o trabalho de Millikan também forneceu convincentemente a primeira prova da teoria quântica do átomo de Bohr. Em trabalhos posteriores, Millikan definiu o termo "raios cósmicos" em 1925 durante seu estudo da radiação do espaço exterior.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, en 1931, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burton_Richter">Burton Richter</a>. Este físico americano liderou a equipa do Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC), que descobriu o mesão J/psi em 1974, ao lado da equipe do Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), liderada por Samuel Ting. Esta descoberta foi parte da chamada Revolução de Novembro da física de partículas. Ele foi o director do SLAC de 1984 a 1999. Recebeu o prémio Nobel da física conjuntamente com Samuel Ting em 1976.</p>

<p>Esta semana ficámos a saber que foi lançada uma versão open-source do webOS. O webOS é uma plataforma de software centrada na web e voltada para a usabilidade para dispositivos inteligentes. O sistema operativo evoluiu constantemente, passando por empresas como a Palm, a HP e, mais recentemente, pela LG Electronics. A versão agora lançada chama-se webOS Open Source Edition (OSE). Esta versão corre para já num Raspberry Pi 3.</p>

<p>Esta semana também ficámos a saber que o foguetão lançado pela SpaceX em 2017 criou um enorme buraco na atmosfera superior da Terra que poderia ter interrompido temporariamente o funcionamento dos sistemas de GPS. O foguetão Falcon 9, descolou em Agosto para colocar um satélite em órbita. Uma equipa liderada por Charles Lin, da Universidade Nacional de Cheng Kung, em Tainan, Taiwan, analisou como o lançamento afectou a ionosfera, uma camada atmosférica composta de electrões e iões livres. O escape do foguetão gerou um buraco de 900 quilómetros de largura no plasma ionosférico.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. São apresentados também o livro Raspberry PI Annual 2018 e a revista HackSpace #5.</p>

<p><em>"An Uber self-driving car hit and killed a woman crossing the street in Arizona, police said on Monday, marking the first fatality involving an autonomous vehicle and a potential blow to the technology expected to transform transportation. The ride services company said it was suspending North American tests of its self-driving vehicles, which are currently going on in Arizona, Pittsburgh and Toronto. So-called robot cars, when fully developed by companies including Uber, Alphabet Inc and General Motors Co, are expected to drastically cut down on motor vehicle fatalities and create billion-dollar businesses. But Monday’s accident underscored the possible challenges ahead for the promising technology as the cars confront real-world situations involving real people. U.S. lawmakers have been debating legislation that would speed introduction of self-driving cars. “This tragic accident underscores why we need to be exceptionally cautious when testing and deploying autonomous vehicle technologies on public roads,” said Democratic Senator Edward Markey, a member of the transportation committee, in a statement."</em> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-selfdriving-uber/self-driving-uber-car-kills-arizona-woman-crossing-street-idUSKBN1GV296">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://thedaily.case.edu/making-solar-panels-last-longer/">Making solar panels last longer</a></h2>

<p><em>"Researchers use machine learning to better gauge failure of solar panels; could lead to longer-lasting panels, lower costs Researchers at Case Western Reserve University have taken a crucial step toward increasing the lifespan of photovoltaic solar panels and potentially lowering solar-energy costs for manufacturers and consumers. A team of scientists at Case Western Reserve’s Solar Durability and Lifetime Extension (SDLE) Research Center recently unveiled a new method to quickly and accurately read tens of thousands of images of solar panels as they break down and ultimately fail over time. This latest research, believed to be the first of its kind, relies on electroluminescence photography coupled with “machine learning” to build on previous gains in measuring the effect of weather and time on solar panels at the research center. “Our partners and collaborators in the industry are very excited because this method will work for any brand and help them improve their solar panels,” said Roger French, the Kyocera Professor of Materials Science and head of the SDLE Research Center. Until now, solar-panel manufacturers had relied primarily on single, static photographs of the photovoltaic cells taken after they failed. They could only draw limited conclusions about why the panel degraded and lost power."</em> <a href="http://thedaily.case.edu/making-solar-panels-last-longer/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.waseda.jp/top/en-news/57687">Monocrystalline silicon thin film for cost-cutting solar cells with 10-times faster growth rate fabricated</a></h2>

<p><em>"A research team from Waseda University and Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech) have successfully produced high-quality thin film monocrystalline silicon with a reduced crystal defect density down to the silicon wafer level at a growth rate that is more than 10 times higher than before. In principle, this method can improve the raw material yield to nearly 100%. Therefore, it can be expected that this technology will make it possible to drastically reduce manufacturing costs while maintaining the power generation efficiency of monocrystalline silicon solar cells, which are used in most high efficient solar cells. Background Solar power generation is a method of generating power where solar light energy is converted directly into electricity using a device called a “solar cell.” Efficiently converting the solar energy that is constantly striking the earth to generate electricity is an effective solution to the problem of global warming related to CO2 emissions. By making the monocrystalline Si solar cells that are at the core of solar power generation systems thinner, it is possible to greatly reduce raw material costs, which account for about 40% of the current module, and by making them flexible and lighter, usage can be expected to expand and installation costs can be expected to decrease. In addition, as a method of reducing manufacturing cost, thin-film monocrystalline Si solar cells that use porous silicon (Double Porous Silicon Layer: DPSL) via lift-off are attracting attention as having a competitive edge in the future."</em> <a href="https://www.waseda.jp/top/en-news/57687">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Lithium-metal batteries — which can hold up to 10 times more charge than the lithium-ion batteries that currently power our phones, laptops and cars — haven’t been commercialized because of a fatal flaw: as these batteries charge and discharge, lithium is deposited unevenly on the electrodes. This buildup cuts the lives of these batteries too short to make them viable, and more importantly, can cause the batteries to short-circuit and catch fire. Now, researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago have developed a solution to this problem in the form of a graphene-oxide coated ‘nanosheet’ that, when placed in between the two electrodes of a lithium-metal battery, prevents uneven plating of lithium and allows the battery to safely function for hundreds of charge/discharge cycles. They report their findings in the journal Advanced Functional Materials. “Our findings demonstrate that two-dimensional materials — in this case, graphene oxide — can help regulate lithium deposition in such a way that extends the life of lithium-metal batteries,” said Reza Shahbazian-Yassar, associate professor of mechanical and industrial engineering in the UIC College of Engineering and corresponding author of the paper. Lithium-metal batteries are so useful because of their high-energy density and relatively light weights compared with conventional batteries."</em> <a href="https://today.uic.edu/graphene-oxide-nanosheets-could-help-bring-lithium-metal-batteries-to-market">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) scientists are part of a national planetary defense team that designed a conceptual spacecraft to deflect Earth-bound asteroids and evaluated whether it would be able to nudge a massive asteroid – which has a remote chance to hitting Earth in 2135 – off course. The design and case study are outlined in a paper published recently in Acta Astronautica (link is external). The 9-meter-tall, 8.8-ton spacecraft – dubbed HAMMER (Hypervelocity Asteroid Mitigation Mission for Emergency Response vehicle) – features a modular design that would enable it to serve as either a kinetic impactor, essentially a battering ram, or as a transport vehicle for a nuclear device. Its possible mission: deflect 101955 Bennu, a massive asteroid around 500 meters (more than five football fields) in diameter, weighing around 79 billion kilograms (1,664 times as heavy as the Titanic), circling the sun at around 63,000 miles per hour. Based on observation data available, Bennu has a 1 in 2,700-chance of striking Earth on Sept. 25, 2135, and it is estimated that the kinetic energy of this impact would be equivalent to 1,200 megatons (80,000 times the energy of the Hiroshima bomb). “The chance of an impact appears slim now, but the consequences would be dire,” said Kirsten Howley, LLNL physicist and coauthor on the paper."</em> <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/news/scientists-design-conceptual-asteroid-deflector-and-evaluate-it-against-massive-potential">[...]</a>

Quantum technologies such as quantum computers have the potential to process information much more quickly and powerfully than conventional computers. That prospect has spurred interest in exotic, complex quantum phenomena, particularly a state called many-body localization. Many-body localization occurs when quantum interactions trap particles in a web-like mesh of random locations. This phase of matter protects the energy stored in quantum states from degrading to heat—an effect that could safeguard information in fragile qubits, which are the building blocks of quantum computation. Up till now efforts to study many-body localization, both theoretically and experimentally, have focussed on quantum systems cooled to temperatures close to absolute zero, or -273° C. “The effect has been assumed to occur only under conditions that are very difficult to engineer,” explains UBC chemical physicist Ed Grant."</em> <a href="https://science.ubc.ca/news/quantum-mechanics-runs-hot-cold-plasma-ubc-research">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Fabrication of Isotopically Enriched, Industry-Compatible Wafers Points Way To Realizing Silicon Spin Quantum Bits with Enhanced Fidelity CEA-Leti, a French technology research institute of the CEA and Inac, a joint fundamental research institute between the CEA and the University Grenoble Alpes, today announced a breakthrough towards large-scale fabrication of quantum bits, or qubits, the elementary bricks of future quantum processors. They demonstrated on a 300 mm pre-industrial platform a new level of isotopic purification in a film deposited by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). This enables creating qubits in thin layers of silicon using a very high purity silicon isotope, 28Si, which produces a crystalline quality comparable to thin films usually made of natural silicon. “Using the isotope 28Si instead of natural silicon is crucial for the optimization of the fidelity of the silicon spin qubit,” said Marc Sanquer, a research director at Inac. “The fidelity of the spin qubit is limited to small values by the presence of nuclear spins in natural silicon. But spin qubit fidelity is greatly enhanced by using 28Si, which has zero nuclear spin."</em> <a href="http://www.leti-cea.com/cea-tech/leti/english/Pages/What's-On/Press%20release/CEA-Shows-Path-to-Creating-Building-Blocks-of-Quantum-Processors-With-28si-Isotope-In-a-CMOS-Fab-Line.aspx">[...]</a>

<p><em>"An Oak Ridge National Laboratory method to improve the energy efficiency of scientific artificial intelligence is showing early promise in efforts to parse insights from volumes of cancer data. Researchers are realizing the potential of deep learning to rapidly advance science, but “training” the underlying neural networks with large volumes of data to tackle the task at hand can require large amounts of energy. These networks also require complex connectivity and enormous amounts of storage, both of which further reduce their energy efficiency and potential in real-world applications. To address this issue, ORNL’s Mohammed Alawad, Hong-Jun Yoon, and Georgia Tourassi developed a novel method for the development of energy-efficient deep neural networks capable of solving complex science problems. They presented their research at the 2017 IEEE Conference on Big Data in Boston. The researchers demonstrated that by converting deep learning neural networks (DNNs) to “deep spiking” neural networks (DSNNs), they can improve the energy efficiency of network design and realization."</em> <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/news/ornl-researchers-design-novel-method-energy-efficient-deep-neural-networks">[...]</a>

It also receives current weather data from WeatherUnderground, using IFTTT and Adafruit.io platforms, and change LEDs colors based on the weather condition. It won't have a good resolution (due to the small number of LEDs), but it's a good way to practice your coding and electronic skills using a small number of components. I'll also be able to create a device that 'knows' current time, without the use of an external real time clock circuit, and that's able to 'sense' changes on the weather."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Minimalist-IoT-Clock-using-ESP8266-Adafruitio-IFTT/">[...]</a>

It is connected via a serial link to an Arduino Pro Mini board, which drives servos. Since each one of the four legs will have two articulations, each with one servo, we need eight servos in total. Here is a list of the material we will use: - a Raspberry Pi Zero W - a Raspberry Pi camera module V2 - a camera adapter for the Raspberry Pi Zero - an Arduino Pro Mini 3.3V/8MHz - 8 micro servos 9g rated ~5V (Tower Pro SG90 or similar) - a 5V switching regulator rated at least 3A - a 2S LiPo battery, 1000mAh is good - a MicroSD card for the Raspberry Pi, 16GB is good - a USB to UART bridge to program the Arduino board - Dupont wires, screws, pins, prototype board, soldering material, and glue Let's start by designing and printing the parts."</em> <a href="https://chapelierfou.org/blog/eyepot-a-creepy-teapot.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"If you came here, you have probably started playing with an ESP8266 as a web server, before. But if you have not: It's incredibly easy to implement a webserver on an ESP8266, and you should try this, today! (The hardest part is getting familiar with how to connect and program your ESP8266 - I will give you some links on this in Step 1). However, once that is accomplished, you don't want to simply serve static content, you want to display changing information such as temperatures or other sensor readings, and you want to add controls to allow turning on and off lights, etc. The general approach to doing so is using a family of techniques known as "AJAX" or Asynchronous Javascript and XML (where XML is typically replaced with JSON in contemporary applications). That is a relatively straight-forward technique to manage data exchange between a web server (your ESP8266), and a web client (browser on your smartphone or PC)."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Easy-ESP8266-Arduino-Core-Web-Controls-With-EmbAJA/">[...]</a>

I won't go into any details about the 555 IC - but if you want to know more you can check it out for yourself here. Basically this project uses a photo cell, also known as a CDS photoresister to change the pitch of the oscillating 555 IC.
