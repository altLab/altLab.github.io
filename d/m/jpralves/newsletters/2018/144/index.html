<p>Faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1550, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Napier">John Napier</a>. Este escocês ficou conhecido por ser ao mesmo tempo matemático, físico e astrónomo. O feito mais conhecido dele foi ter descoberto os logaritmos. Ele também inventou os chamados "ossos de Napier" e tornou comum o uso do ponto decimal em aritmética e matemática.</p>

<p>Fazem também anos que nasciam, em 1905, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Segr%C3%A8">Emilio Segrè</a> e <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_Berkner">Lloyd Berkner</a>. O primeiro era um físico italiano-americano que partilhou (com Owen Chamberlain) o Prêmio Nobel de Física de 1959 pela descoberta do antiprotão, uma anti-partícula com a mesma massa de um protão, mas com o oposto na carga eléctrica. Ele também criou átomos do novo elemento Tecnécio (1937) e Astatino (1940). O tecnécio ocupou um espaço até então vazio na Tabela Periódica, e foi o primeiro elemento artificial não encontrado na natureza. O astatino existe naturalmente apenas em quantidades extremamente pequenas porque é produto decadente de átomos maiores, e tendo uma meia-vida de apenas algumas horas, desaparece rapidamente por decomposição radioactiva para se tornarem átomos de outro elemento. Estima-se que exista actualmente cerca de 31 gramas de astatino na Terra, fazendo deste o elemento mais raro de que se tem conhecimento.
O segundo, Lloyd, era um físico e engenheiro norte-americano, que foi o primeiro a medir a extensão, incluindo a altura e a densidade, da ionosfera (camadas ionizadas da atmosfera da Terra), levando a uma compreensão completa da propagação de ondas de rádio e ajudou a desenvolver sistemas de radar, especialmente o sistema de alerta precoce à distancia. Mais tarde, investigou a origem e o desenvolvimento da atmosfera terrestre. No início da sua carreira, ele trabalhou em faróis de radio-navegação para a divisão Airways do Bureau of Lighthouses (1927-28), como engenheiro de rádio na expedição Byrd Antarctic. Voltando ao Bureau of Standards dos EUA, ele estudou a ionosfera usando transmissões de rádio-pulso, e depois o magnetismo terrestre com a Instituição Carnegie.</p>

<p>Na semana que passou, Linus Torvalds anunciou o lançamento do Kernel Linux 4.15. Após um ciclo de desenvolvimento que era foram do comum em muitas maneiras esta semana foi possivel lançar a versão final. Esta foi uma versão que teve atrasos directamente atribuídos aos problemas relacionados com o meltdown e com o spectre - os bugs dos CPU.</p>

<p>Hoje a SpaceX lançou com sucesso o GovSat-1 a partir do Falcon 9. O foguetão Falcon 9 foi lançado carregando um satélite de geo-comunicações encomendado pelo governo do Luxemburgo. O satélite, criado pela Orbital STK e operado pela SES, apoiará operações humanitárias e militares para o Luxemburgo, entre outras funções de comunicação. O foguetão descolou da Cabo Canaveral na quarta-feira, um dia depois do lançamento inicial planeado. A janela original não foi viável devido ao clima, mas o foguetão foi lançado conforme previsto no inicio da sua data alternativa com as condições climáticas favoráveis do dia de hoje.</p>

<p><em>"After a release cycle that was unusual in so many (bad) ways, this last week was really pleasant. Quiet and small, and no last-minute panics, just small fixes for various issues. I never got a feeling that I'd need to extend things by yet another week, and 4.15 looks fine to me. Half the changes in the last week were misc driver stuff (gpu, input, networking) with the other half being a mix of networking, core kernel and arch updates (mainly x86). But all of it is tiny.

<p><em>"The cosmos offers an early morning trifecta for the world’s skygazers Wednesday: a super blue blood moon. That’s quite a mouthful, so let’s briefly break down what it all means: It is a supermoon because it will turn full at the closest point to Earth in its orbit, known as perigee, appearing slightly bigger and about 14 percent brighter than normal. Perigee will occur Tuesday, the day before full moon, when our planet and the moon will be 223,068 miles apart. Supermoons are fairly common, on average happening about every 14 months. This one to end January is actually the third in a row, following supermoons on Jan. 1 and Dec. 3, 2017. It is a blue moon because it is the second full moon occurring within the same month."</em> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2018/01/26/how-and-where-to-see-the-super-blue-blood-moon-of-2018/?utm_term=.b7547bdae9d6">[...]</a>

<p><em>"There is a lot of progress still to be made when it comes to batteries and energy storage. The problem of storing energy is often underestimated however. Gradual evolution in the world of batteries is more likely than a revolution. TU Delft's new batteries lab will focus primarily on research into potential alternatives for what is currently the standard technology: the lithium-ion battery. Confusing times "We are living in confusing times when it comes to batteries and energy storage", says TU Delft's Prof. Fokko Mulder. In his view, misconceptions have emerged about what is and is not possible in terms of energy storage, partly because of the rise of renewable sources such as wind and solar energy."</em> <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/2018/tnw/in-search-of-better-li-ion-batteries-and-alternatives/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Engineers from Cornell and Honeywell Aerospace have demonstrated a new method for remotely vaporizing electronics into thin air, giving devices the ability to vanish – along with their valuable data – if they were to get into the wrong hands. This unique ability to self-destruct is at the heart of an emerging technology known as transient electronics, in which key portions of a circuit, or the whole circuit itself, can discreetly disintegrate or dissolve. And because no harmful byproducts are released upon vaporization, engineers envision biomedical and environmental applications along with data protection. There are a number of existing techniques for triggering the vaporization, each with inherent drawbacks. Some transient electronics use soluble conductors that dissolve when contacted by water, requiring the presence of moisture. Others disintegrate when they reach a specific temperature, requiring a heating element and power source to be attached."</em> <a href="http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2018/01/engineers-create-new-architecture-vaporizable-electronics">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2018/01/calibrate">People with tetraplegia gain rapid use of brain-computer interface</a></h2>

<p><em>"A new approach to calibrating the pioneering BrainGate brain-computer interface allowed three clinical trial participants with tetraplegia to gain control of a computer cursor after just one simple calibration step. PROVIDENCE, R.I. [Brown University] — For a brain-computer interface (BCI) to be truly useful for a person with tetraplegia, it should be ready whenever it’s needed, with minimal expert intervention, including the very first time it’s used. In a new study in the Journal of Neural Engineering, researchers in the BrainGate* collaboration demonstrate new techniques that allowed three participants to achieve peak BCI performance within three minutes of engaging in an easy, one-step process. One participant, “T5,” a 63-year-old man who had never used a BCI before, needed only 37 seconds of calibration time before he could control a computer cursor to reach targets on a screen, just by imagining using his hand to move a joystick. Dr. David Brandman, lead author of the study and an engineering postdoctoral researcher at Brown University, said that while additional innovations will help to move implantable BCIs like BrainGate toward clinical availability for patients, this advance of rapid, intuitive calibration is a key one. It could allow future users and their caregivers to use the system much more quickly and to keep it calibrated over the long term."</em> <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2018/01/calibrate">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A team of researchers from the Information Sciences Institute at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering has received a $16.7 million grant from the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) to develop an automated information translation and summarization tool to quickly translate obscure languages. Principal investigator and ISI research team leader Scott Miller, ISI computer scientist Jonathan May and ISI research lead Elizabeth Boschee, with senior advisers Prem Natarajan and Kevin Knight, are leading a team of about 30 researchers, including academics from the University of Massachusetts, Northeastern University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Notre Dame. Natarajan is the Michael Keston executive director and research professor of computer science at ISI; Knight is ISI research director and Dean’s Professor of Computer Science. The ISI team’s project is called SARAL, for Summarization and domain-Adaptive Retrieval, and includes experts in machine translation, speech recognition, morphology, information retrieval, representation and summarization. Saral is a Hindi word whose translations include “simple” and “ingenious.” “The overall objective is to provide a Google-like capability, except the queries are in English, but the retrieved documents are in a low-resource foreign language,” said Miller, who is based at ISI’s new office in Boston. “The aim is to retrieve relevant foreign-language documents and to provide English summaries explaining how each document is relevant to the English query.” In this project, the team will initially test its systems using Tagalog and Swahili, two low-resource languages selected by IARPA for the task."</em> <a href="http://news.usc.edu/134901/uscs-information-sciences-institute-project-aims-to-quickly-translate-obscure-less-common-languages/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Spintronics in materials of just a few atoms thick is an emerging field in which the ‘spin’ of electrons is used to process data, rather than the charge. Unfortunately, the spin only lasts for a very short time, making it (as yet) difficult to exploit in electronics. Researchers from the Kavli Institute of Nanoscience at TU Delft, working with the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research’s AMOLF institute, have now found a way to convert the spin information into a predictable light signal at room temperature. The discovery brings the worlds of spintronics and nanophotonics closer together and might lead to the development of an energy-efficient way of processing data, in data centres, for example. The researchers have given an account of their results in Science. The research revolved around a nano-construction consisting of two components: an extremely thin silver thread, and a 2D material called tungsten disulfide."</em> <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/2018/tu-delft/researchers-from-tu-delft-combine-spintronics-and-nanophotonics-in-2d-material/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scientists at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore) have created a customizable, fabric-like power source that can be cut, folded or stretched without losing its function. Led by Professor Chen Xiaodong, Associate Chair (Faculty) at the School of Materials Science &amp; Engineering, the team reported in the journal Advanced Materials (print edition 8 January) how they have created the wearable power source, a supercapacitor, which works like a fast-charging battery and can be recharged many times. Crucially, they have made their supercapacitor customizable or “editable”, meaning its structure and shape can be changed after it is manufactured, while retaining its function as a power source. Existing stretchable supercapacitors are made into predetermined designs and structures, but the new invention can be stretched multi-directionally, and is less likely to be mismatched when it is joined up to other electrical components. The new supercapacitor, when edited into a honeycomb-like structure, has the ability to store an electrical charge four times higher than most existing stretchable supercapacitors. In addition, when stretched to four times its original length, it maintains nearly 98 per cent of the initial ability to store electrical energy, even after 10,000 stretch-and-release cycles."</em> <a href="http://news.ntu.edu.sg/pages/newsdetail.aspx?URL=http://news.ntu.edu.sg/news/Pages/NR2018_Jan30.aspx&amp;Guid=2e31380c-7056-424a-9452-3d27fdf3d687&amp;Category=News%20Releases">[...]</a>

Although Internet-connected “smart” devices have in recent years penetrated numerous industries and private homes, the technological phenomenon has left the research lab largely untouched. Spreadsheets, individual software programs, and even pens and paper remain standard tools for recording and sharing data in academic and industry labs. TetraScience, co-founded by Spin Wang SM ’15, a graduate of electrical engineering and computer science, has developed a data-integration platform that connects disparate types of lab equipment and software systems, in-house and at outsourced drug developers and manufacturers. It then unites the data from all these sources in the cloud for speedier and more accurate research, cost savings, and other benefits. “Software and hardware systems [in labs] cannot communicate with each other in a consistent way,” says Wang, TetraScience’s chief technology officer, who co-founded the startup with former Harvard University postdocs Salvatore Savo and Alok Tayi."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2018/startup-tetrascience-makes-labs-smarter-0125">[...]</a>

<p><em>"To see what is driving the exotic behavior in some atomically thin – or 2-D – materials, and find out what happens when they are stacked like Lego bricks in different combinations with other ultrathin materials, scientists want to observe their properties at the smallest possible scales. Enter MAESTRO, a next-generation platform for X-ray experiments at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) at the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), that is providing new microscale views of this weird 2-D world. In a study published Jan. 22 in the journal Nature Physics, researchers zeroed in on signatures of exotic behavior of electrons in a 2-D material with microscale resolution. The new insights gleaned from these experiments show that the properties of the 2-D semiconductor material they studied, called tungsten disulfide (WS2), may be highly tunable, with possible applications for electronics and other forms of information storage, processing, and transfer. Those applications could include next-gen devices spawned from emerging fields of research like spintronics, excitonics and valleytronics. In these fields, researchers seek to manipulate properties like momentum and energy levels in a material’s electrons and counterpart particles to more efficiently carry and store information – analogous to the flipping of ones and zeroes in conventional computer memory."</em> <a href="http://newscenter.lbl.gov/2018/01/26/xray-experiments-suggest-high-tunability-2d-material/">[...]</a>

The Rice lab ran more than 20 computer simulations of how polymers and cement molecules come together at the nanoscale and what drives their adhesion.

Using an emerging technology – a pocket sized, portable DNA sequencer - the scientists sequenced a complete human genome, in fragments hundreds of times larger than usual, enabling new biological insights. The authors generated a new method for sequencing “ultra-long” sequences of DNA, more than a thousand times longer than the original reads used to generate the human genome reference sequence in 2001. Recently the authors have used this method to generate the longest ever read sequenced at 1,204,840 bases in length, 8,000 times longer than a typical sequencing read.

This memristor technology will be showcased at ISCAS 2018, an international circuits and systems conference, in Florence, Italy, in May, where the team will also be presenting seven original research papers. In a study published in the journal Scientific Reports, researchers show how they have pushed the memristor – a simpler and smaller alternative to the transistor, with the capability of altering its resistance and storing multiple memory states – to a new level of performance after experimenting with its component materials. Traditionally, the processing of data in electronics has relied on integrated circuits (chips) featuring vast numbers of transistors – microscopic switches that control the flow of electrical current by turning it on or off. Transistors have got smaller and smaller to meet the increasing demands of technology, but are now reaching their physical limit, with – for example – the processing chips that power smartphones containing an average of five billion transistors. Memristors could hold the key to a new era in electronics, being both smaller and simpler in form than transistors, low-energy, and with the ability to retain data by ‘remembering’ the amount of charge that has passed through them – potentially resulting in computers that switch on and off instantly and never forget."</em> <a href="https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/news/5540">[...]</a>

<p><em>"An international collaboration of quantum physicists from the University of Bristol, Microsoft, Google, Imperial College, Max Planck Institute, and the Sun Yat-sen University have introduced a new algorithm to solve the energy structure of quantum systems on quantum computers. They have tested this algorithm on a silicon quantum photonic processor which performs the computation using photons, the elementary particles of light. The energy structure of a quantum system is made of quantised energy levels, the lowest energy level is called ground-state, while the higher energy levels are called excited states. In particular, this new algorithm is capable of finding the excited-states in a way that seems to have no direct analogue on a classical computer, providing a new way of studying physics and chemistry at the microscopic level. Fundamental chemical and physical properties of systems can be characterised by finding a particular set of quantized states called eigenstates which contains the ground state of the system (the state with minimal energy) and excited states (stationary states with higher energies). Author Jarrod McClean, from Google’s Quantum AI Lab, said: “Expanding the toolkit for excited states is crucial if we want quantum computers to make meaningful contributions to important areas such as solar cells and batteries.” It is expected that large quantum computers will be able to simulate complex chemical systems, a task impossible for classical computers, increasing our knowledge of physics and chemistry."</em> <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2018/january/quantum-photonic-chip.html">[...]</a>

If the box always returns the same color ball no matter what, it’s said to be constant; if the color of the ball changes with the color of the button, it’s balanced. Your assignment is to determine which type of box you’ve got by asking it to perform its secret act only once. At first glance, the task might seem hopeless.

<p><em>"In this Instructable, I will demonstrate the construction of a dual-axis, single-mirror laser beam steering module using 3D printed parts and inexpensive components from eBay. This project has similarities to Arduino Laser Show with Full XY Control and Arduino Laser Show With Real Galvos but I believe is the first to use a 3D printed design with inexpensive solenoids. I am putting all the design files under the GPLv3 so that the design can be enhanced and improved upon. Although at present I have only assembled the module and written some very basic test code, my hope is that one day I can take it to the next level by incorporating the vector graphics code from my earlier Instructable, Super Fast Analog Voltages from Arduino.

And you can control up to 20 devices through infrared (IR), with 20 different actions. What is it? It is a universal remote based on an Arduino board. Why this project?

<p><em>"We know that plants require water as it acts as a transportation medium for nutrients by carrying the dissolved sugar and other nutrients through the plant. Without water, plants will wither. However excessive watering will fill pores in the soil, disturbing the balance of water and air and preventing the plant from breathing. Proper balance of water is important. The soil moisture sensor measures the moisture content of the soil. By deciding on a particular percentage, we can be reminded to water our plants when the soil is too dry."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Moisture-based-Smart-Irrigation/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A few years ago, I started making my first Word Clock, inspired by the nice Instructables available.Now that I made eight Word Clocks, which I try to improve each time, I think it is time to share my experience! An advantage of my experience is that the latest version of my Word Clock is actually quite simple: if you have all the components, you should be able to build it in one day. First, the inside of the Word Clock. My current version uses a RGB led strip: this is a led strip in which each 'light bulb' consists of a Red, Green and Blue led. By combining the three colors, (almost) every color can be created. The RGB led strip is controlled by one input (still a bit of magic to me)."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Word-Clock-RGB/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Solve real-world electronic and engineering problems with your Raspberry Pi and the help of renowned technology hacker and author, Simon Monk This is a very simple project to make. In fact, all you really need to do is plug the Sense or Unicorn HAT onto the Raspberry Pi’s GPIO header and install the software. This project displays the current time in binary. The rows of the display are (from top to bottom) the last two digits of the year (e.g. 15), the month number, the day of the month, the hour (24-hour format), the minute, the second, and finally hundredths of a second. The full article can be found in The MagPi 42 and was written by Simon Monk You’ll Need Raspberry Pi with 40-pin GPIO header (A+, B+, 2 and 3) Sense HAT or Pimoroni Unicorn HAT USB WiFi adaptor or Ethernet connection Reading the binary clock To read a binary clock, you either need to be good at recognising binary numbers or use a bit of arithmetic to calculate the time, by adding up the binary digit values for the LEDs that are lit on a particular row."</em> <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/binary-clock/">[...]</a>
