<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1656, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmond_Halley">Edmond Halley</a>. Este astrónomo, geofísico e matemático inglês, ficou conhecido por reconhecer que um cometa brilhante (mais tarde chamado com o seu nome) apareceu diversas vezes, calculando sua órbita e prevendo com sucesso seu retorno. Depois de ter originado a pergunta que incitava Isaac Newton a escrever o seminal Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, Halley editou e organizou a sua publicação. Halley foi professor de geometria em Oxford e mais tarde nomeado astrónomo real. Halley identificou o movimento apropriado das estrelas, estudou o movimento e as marés da Lua, percebeu que as nebulosas eram nuvens de gás luminoso entre as estrelas e que a aurora era um fenómeno ligado ao magnetismo da Terra. A sua previsão do trânsito de Vénus levou à viagem do capitão James Cook ao Taiti.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1848, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottlob_Frege">Gottlob Frege</a>. Este matemático e lógico alemão fundou a lógica simbólica moderna e foi o primeiro a mostrar a matemática como uma extensão da lógica. Ele estendeu o trabalho de Boole inventando símbolos lógicos (símbolos para “ou”, “se-então”, etc.) que melhoraram a lógica silogística que substituiu. Ele também trabalhou em questões gerais de lógica filosófica e semântica. A sua teoria do significado, baseada em fazer uma distinção entre o que um termo linguístico se refere e o que ele expressa, ainda é influente. Frege tentou fornecer uma base rigorosa para a matemática com base em princípios puramente lógicos, mas abandonou a tentativa quando Bertrand Russell, em cujo trabalho ele teve uma profunda influência, apontou um paradoxo que tornou o sistema inconsistente.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1854, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Rydberg">Johannes Rydberg</a>. Este físico sueco ficou conhecido pela constante de Rydberg na sua fórmula empírica que relacionava os números de onda das linhas espectrais de um elemento (1890). Esta fórmula expressava relações fundamentais nessas linhas, que ele supunha serem o resultado da natureza e estrutura internas dos átomos de um elemento. Em 1897, ele sugeriu que um número atómico para cada um dos elementos, em vez de pesos atómicos, seria uma forma melhor para organizar os elementos e a sua periodicidade das suas características. O seu trabalho forneceu a base para a descoberta da estrutura do invólucro de electrões do átomo. Posteriormente, foi estabelecido que o número inteiro de cargas positivas no núcleo de um elemento (seu número de protões) correspondia à sua ideia de número atómico.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1866, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Austin,_1st_Baron_Austin">Herbert Austin</a>. Este engenheiro inglês fundou a Austin Motor Company (1905), cujo modelo Austin Seven influenciou muito o design britânico e europeu de carros leves. Em 1884, após concluir sua educação inicial, Herbert mudou-se para Melbourne, na Austrália, e aprendeu engenharia na Langlands Foundry. Mais tarde ele tornou-se o gerente da Wolseley Sheep Shearing Company. Em 1893, ele volta ao Reino Unido com essa empresa em 1893 e tornou-se logo o gerente de produção. Da experiência obtida nas longas jornadas no interior da Austrália, ele teve uma visão sobre a necessidade de veículos movidos a gasolina. Em 1895, ele produziu o primeiro carro Wolseley (um veículo de três rodas) e em 1900, seu primeiro design de quatro rodas Wolseley. Em 1914, a empresa produzia mais de 1000 carros com 2000 funcionários.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1923, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Kilby">Jack Kilby</a>. Este engenheiro eletrotécnico norte-americano inventou o primeiro circuito integrado (IC), pelo qual partilhou o Prémio Nobel de Física 2000. O seu interesse por eletrónica cresceu no seu passatempo de rádio amador dos tempos da escola. Anos depois, a trabalhar na Texas Instruments, ele inventou uma maneira de miniaturizar um complicado circuito de transístores, construindo os seus componentes num bloco de silício com conexões internas que eliminavam a fiação externa. Em 12 de setembro de 1958, ele demonstrou seu primeiro circuito integrado ao seu supervisor. Alguns meses depois, um dispositivo IC numa forma melhorada foi inventado noutra parte por Robert Noyce. Geoffrey W.A. Dummer também teve o conceito anos antes, mas não um dispositivo funcional. Em setembro de 1965, a equipa de Kilby desenvolveu a primeira calculadora eletrónica de bolso usando IC's.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1986, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">Aaron Swartz</a>. Este programador de computadores norte-americano foi empresário, escritor, organizador político e hacktivista da Internet. Ele esteve envolvido no desenvolvimento do formato de feed RSS e no formato de publicação Markdown, na organização Creative Commons, e na estrutura do site web.py, e foi co-fundador da o site de notícias sociais Reddit. Ele recebeu o título de co-fundador pelo proprietário da Y Combinator, Paul Graham, após a formação da Not a Bug, Inc. (uma fusão do projeto Infogami de Swartz com uma empresa dirigida por Alexis Ohanian e Steve Huffman).</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que a IBM vai adquirir a Red Hat. Esta aquisição vem tornar a IBM um dos maiores providers de Cloud. Por outro lado reforça a presença do Open Source no mundo corporate. A Red Hat é a fabricante do RHEL e do Fedora, distribuição que fez esta semana 15 anos.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como um modelo 3D que poderá ser útil.</p>

<p><em>"New STM32L0x0 Value Line microcontrollers (MCUs) from STMicroelectronics present an additional, low-cost entry point to the STM32L0 * series, delivering ultra-low-power technology and efficient 32-bit performance with the Arm® Cortex® -M0+ core for designers facing tight cost, size, or power constraints. With up to 128Kbyte Flash memory, 20KByte SRAM, and 512Byte true embedded EEPROM on-chip the STM32L0x0 MCUs save external components to cut down on board space and BOM cost. In addition to price-sensitive and space-constrained consumer devices such as fitness trackers, computer or gaming accessories, and remotes, the new STM32L0x0 Value Line MCUs are ideal for personal medical devices, industrial sensors, and IoT devices such as building controls, weather stations, smart locks, smoke detectors, or fire alarms. ST’s power-saving low-leakage process technology and device features such as a low-power UART, low-power timer, 41µA 10ksample/s ADC, and wake-up from power saving in as little as 5µs, bring ambitious energy-management targets within reach. Designers can use these devices to achieve goals such as extending battery runtime without sacrificing product features, increasing wireless mobility, or endowing devices like smart meters or IoT sensors with up to 10-year battery-life leveraging the ultra-frugal 670nA power-down current with RTC and RAM retention. Complementing the affordability of the new Value Line devices, the development ecosystem allows low-cost design starts."</em> <a href="https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/about/media-center/press-item.html/n4096.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/news/new-tech-delivers-high-tech-film-blocks-electromagnetic-interference">New Tech Delivers High-Tech Film That Blocks Electromagnetic Interference</a></h2>

<p><em>"NYU Tandon Chemical Engineer Andre Taylor and Collaborators Use Cost-Effective Process to Make Strong, Flexible Films that Allow Light In but Keep Electromagnetic Interference Out Electromagnetic interference (EMI), which can harm smartphones, tablets, chips, drones, wearables, and even aircraftand human health, is increasing with the explosive proliferation of devices that generate it. The marketfor EM-blocking solutions, which employ conductive or magnetic materials, is expected to surpass $7 billion by 2022. André Taylor, associate professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering, along with a team that included Yury Gogotsi, Distinguished University and Charles T. and Ruth M. Bach Professor Materials Science and Engineering at Drexel University, and Menachem Elimelech, Roberto C. Goizueta Professor of Chemical &amp; Environmental Engineering at Yale University used an innovative technique to produce relatively low-cost EMI-blocking composite films. The study, “Layer-by-Layer Assembly of Cross-Functional Semi-transparent MXene-Carbon Nanotubes Composite Films for Next-Generation Electromagnetic Interference Shielding,” appears in the October 31, 2018 issue of Advanced Functional Materials. Lead authors include Guo-Ming Weng, a post-doctoral fellow at NYU Tandon, and Jinyang Li, associate professor of materials science and engineering at Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China. To fashion the films, the team employed spin-spray layer-by-layer processing(SSLbL), a method Taylor pioneeredin 2012."</em> <a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/news/new-tech-delivers-high-tech-film-blocks-electromagnetic-interference">[...]</a>

<p><em>"For the first time, the targeted functionalization of carbon-based nanostructures allows the direct mapping of current paths, thereby paving the way for novel quantum devices Computers are getting faster and increasingly powerful. However, at the same time computing requires noticeably more energy, which is almost completely converted to wasted heat. This is not only harmful to the environment, but also limits further miniaturization of electronic components and increase of clock rates. A way out of this dilemma are conductors with no electrical resistance. Based on carbon nanostructures, such conductors can be realized. By applying sophisticated heating processes to nanostructured silicon carbide crystals, small graphene structures, so-called graphene nanoribbons, can be produced at their edges."</em> <a href="https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/tu/pressestelle/aktuell/9078/en">[...]</a>

<p><em>"With a love for the environment that took root on his family’s farm, senior Jesse Hinricher aims to put less expensive components into more efficient batteries. Energy production can be expensive, or inefficient, or toxic to the environment — or some unfortunate combination of the three. But Jesse Hinricher thinks it doesn’t have to be. Hinricher, an MIT senior majoring in chemical engineering, has been conducting research focused on specialized batteries that could be plugged into the grid to provide renewable energy on demand. Specifically, he works on swapping out some of the pricier electrolytes in so-called redox flow batteries for more abundant ones, which could help make clean energy more affordable. He cites his rural childhood as the initial source of his passion for environmental conservation."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2018/jesse-hinricher-student-sustainable-energy-1101">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.army.mil/article/213290/">Army scientist seeks enhanced Soldier systems through quantum research</a></h2>

<p><em>"Researchers at the U.S. Army Research Laboratory and the Joint Quantum Institute have created a pristine quantum light source that has the potential to lead to more secure communications and enhanced sensing capabilities for Soldiers. ARL's Dr. Elizabeth Goldschmidt and JQI's Dr. Sunil Mittal and Prof. Mohammad Hafezi discuss this research in their paper titled "A topological source of quantum light" that is featured in the journal Nature. Photons, the smallest amount of light that exists, are useful when it comes to carrying quantum information, which can be used for encryption to avoid interception from adversaries and enhanced sensitivity to the environment. According to the researchers, one major part of the puzzle is that the photons must be undisturbed and as similar as possible in order for secure communications and Soldier systems to operate at the highest quality. The research team has successfully developed a silicon chip that guides light around the device's edge, where it is protected from disruptions. "Quantum sources, such as the one demonstrated in our research, are an enabling technology for integrated photonics-based scalable quantum networks and quantum information systems that require indistinguishable photons," Goldschmidt said For this experiment, the researchers used silicon to convert infrared laser light into pairs of different-colored single photons."</em> <a href="https://www.army.mil/article/213290/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Novel complex quantum entanglement generated in the laboratory for the first time For future technologies such as quantum computers and quantum encryption, the experimental mastery of complex quantum systems is inevitable. Scientists from the University of Vienna and the Austrian Academy of Sciences have succeeded in making another leap. While physicists around the world are trying to increase the number of two-dimensional systems, so-called qubits, researchers around Anton Zeilinger are breaking new ground. They pursue the idea to use more complex quantum systems as qubits and thus can increase the information capacity with the same number of particles. The developed methods and technologies could in the future enable the teleportation of complex quantum systems.

<p><em>"When two atomically thin two-dimensional layers are stacked on top of each other and one layer is made to rotate against the second layer, they begin to produce patterns — the familiar moiré patterns — that neither layer can generate on its own and that facilitate the passage of light and electrons, allowing for materials that exhibit unusual phenomena. For example, when two graphene layers are overlaid and the angle between them is 1.1 degrees, the material becomes a superconductor. “It’s a bit like driving past a vineyard and looking out the window at the vineyard rows. Every now and then, you see no rows because you’re looking directly along a row,” said Nathaniel Gabor, an associate professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of California, Riverside. “This is akin to what happens when two atomic layers are stacked on top of each other. At certain angles of twist, everything is energetically allowed."</em> <a href="https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2018/11/05/physicists-name-and-codify-new-field-nanotechnology-electron-quantum">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The ALPHA-g and GBAR experiments have received their first beams of antiprotons We learn it at high school: release two objects of different mass in the absence of friction forces and they fall down at the same rate in Earth’s gravity. What we haven’t learned, because it hasn’t been directly measured in experiments, is whether antimatter falls down at the same rate as ordinary matter or if it might behave differently. Two new experiments at CERN, ALPHA-g and GBAR, have now started their journey towards answering this question. ALPHA-g is very similar to the ALPHA experiment, which makes neutral antihydrogen atoms by taking antiprotons from the Antiproton Decelerator (AD) and binding them with positrons from a sodium-22 source. ALPHA then confines the resulting neutral antihydrogen atoms in a magnetic trap and shines laser light or microwaves onto them to measure their internal structure. The ALPHA-g experiment has the same type of apparatus for making and trapping antiatoms, except that it is oriented vertically."</em> <a href="https://home.cern/news/news/experiments/new-antimatter-gravity-experiments-begin-cern">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scientists are working to dramatically speed up the development of fusion energy in an effort to deliver power to the electric grid soon enough to help mitigate impacts of climate change. The arrival of a breakthrough technology—high-temperature superconductors, which can be used to build magnets that produce stronger magnetic fields than previously possible—could help them achieve this goal. Researchers plan to use this technology to build magnets at the scale required for fusion, followed by construction of what would be the world's first fusion experiment to yield a net energy gain. The effort is a collaboration between Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Plasma Science &amp; Fusion Center and Commonwealth Fusion Systems, and they will present their work at the American Physical Society Division of Plasma Physics meeting in Portland, Ore. Fusion power is generated when nuclei of small atoms combine into larger ones in a process that releases enormous amounts of energy. These nuclei, typically heavier cousins of hydrogen called deuterium and tritium, are positively charged and so feel strong repulsion that can only be overcome at temperatures of hundreds of millions of degrees. While these temperatures, and thus fusion reactions, can be produced in modern fusion experiments, the conditions required for a net energy gain have not yet been achieved."</em> <a href="https://phys.org/news/2018-11-faster-cheaper-path-fusion-energy.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A new study is a step forward in understanding why perovskite materials work so well in energy devices and potentially leads the way toward a theorized “hot” technology that would significantly improve the efficiency of today’s solar cells. A closer look at materials that make up conventional solar cells reveals a nearly rigid arrangement of atoms with little movement. But in hybrid perovskites, a promising class of solar cell materials, the arrangements are more flexible and atoms dance wildly around, an effect that impacts the performance of the solar cells but has been difficult to measure. In a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, an international team of researchers led by the U.S. Department of Energy’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory has developed a new understanding of those wild dances and how they affect the functioning of perovskite materials. The results could explain why perovskite solar cells are so efficient and aid the quest to design hot-carrier solar cells, a theorized technology that would almost double the efficiency limits of conventional solar cells by converting more sunlight into usable electrical energy. Piece of the puzzle Perovskite solar cells, which can be produced at room temperature, offer a less expensive and potentially better performing alternative to conventional solar cell materials like silicon, which have to be manufactured at extremely high temperatures to eliminate defects."</em> <a href="https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/news/2018-11-06-dancing-atoms-perovskite-materials-provide-insight-how-solar-cells-work.aspx">[...]</a>

<p><em>"New design could greatly extend the shelf life of single-use metal-air batteries for electric vehicles, off-grid storage, and other applications. Metal-air batteries are one of the lightest and most compact types of batteries available, but they can have a major limitation: When not in use, they degrade quickly, as corrosion eats away at their metal electrodes. Now, MIT researchers have found a way to substantially reduce that corrosion, making it possible for such batteries to have much longer shelf lives. While typical rechargeable lithium-ion batteries only lose about 5 percent of their charge after a month of storage, they are too costly, bulky, or heavy for many applications. Primary (nonrechargeable) aluminum-air batteries are much less expensive and more compact and lightweight, but they can lose 80 percent of their charge a month. The MIT design overcomes the problem of corrosion in aluminum-air batteries by introducing an oil barrier between the aluminum electrode and the electrolyte — the fluid between the two battery electrodes that eats away at the aluminum when the battery is on standby."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2018/metal-air-batteries-extending-life-1108">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Using solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) techniques, scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Ames Laboratory discovered a new quantum criticality in a superconducting material, leading to a greater understanding of the link between magnetism and unconventional superconductivity. Most iron-arsenide superconductors display both magnetic and structural (or nematic) transitions, making it difficult to understand the role they play in superconducting states. But a compound of calcium, potassium, iron, and arsenic, and doped with small amounts of nickel, CaK(Fe1-xNix)4As4, first made at Ames Laboratory, has been discovered to exhibit a new magnetic state called a hedgehog spin-vortex crystal antiferromagnetic state without nematic transitions. “Spin or nematic fluctuations can be considered to play an important role for unconventional superconductivity,” said Yuji Furukawa, a senior scientist at Ames Laboratory and a professor of Physics and Astronomy at Iowa State University. “With this particular material, we were able to examine only the magnetic fluctuations, and NMR is one of the most sensitive techniques for examining them.” He continued, “using 75As NMR, we discovered that CaKFe4As4 is located at a hedgehog spin-vortex crystal antiferromagnetic quantum critical point which is avoided due to superconductivity. The discovery of the magnetic quantum criticality without nematicity in CaK(Fe1−xNix)4As4 suggests that the spin fluctuations are the primary driver of superconductivity.” Furukawa’s discovery was a collaboration between Ames Laboratory’s world-leading SSNMR team and the lab’s condensed matter physicists, including Paul Canfield, a senior scientist at Ames Laboratory and a Distinguished Professor and the Robert Allen Wright Professor of Physics and Astronomy at Iowa State University."</em> <a href="https://www.ameslab.gov/news/news-releases/new-quantum-criticality-discovered-in-superconductivity">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In this tutorial, you’ll learn everything you need to know about the MQTT messaging protocol, why you would want to use it, and how it’s implemented. In a nutshell, MQTT uses your existing Internet home network to send messages to your IoT devices and respond to those messages. Brief History MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a publish/subscribe messaging protocol that works on top of the TCP/IP protocol. The first version of the protocol was developed by Andy Stanford-Clark of IBM and Arlen Nipper of Cirrus Link in 1999. What makes MQTT faster than say sending HTTP requests with your IoT device is MQTT messages can be as small as 2 bytes, whereas HTTP requires headers which contains a lot of information that other devices might not care about. Also, if you have multiple devices waiting for a request with HTTP, you’ll need to send a POST action to each client."</em> <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/introduction-to-mqtt">[...]</a>
