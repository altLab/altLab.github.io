<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1793, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Chasles">Michel Chasles</a>. Este Matemático francês  elaborou a teoria da geometria projetiva moderna, o estudo das propriedades de uma linha geométrica ou figura plana que permanece inalterada quando a figura é projectada em um plano a partir de um ponto não ou o plano ou a figura. No seu texto Traité de géométrie, em 1852, Chasles discute o rácio cruzado, lápis e involuções, todas as noções que ele introduziu.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1885, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Handley_Page">Frederick Handley Page</a>. Este projectista de aviões britânico construiu o Handley Page 0/400, o primeiro bombardeiro bimotor do mundo para o Royal Flying Corps, um dos maiores aviões usados na Primeira Guerra Mundial, que realizou os seus primeiros bombardeiros em grande escala em instalações militares inimigas e bases submarinas em Novembro de 1916. Em 1918, ele tinha criado um bombardeiro de quatro motores que poderia atacar as zonas industriais do Saar e do Ruhr, na Alemanha. Em 1930, ele produziu o primeiro avião civil de 40 lugares, o Hércules. Para a Segunda Guerra Mundial, Page voltou a produzir aviões militares, sendo o mais importante o bombardeiro Halifax. O governo comprou 7.000 desses aviões. Ele foi condecorado pela sua contribuição para o esforço de guerra. Depois da guerra, Page projetou o bombardeiro a jato de quatro motores, o Victor.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a conhecer o novo Raspberry PI 3 modelo A+. Passou a ser possível ter no footprint do modelo A as capacidades de velocidade de relógio de 1.4Ghz e o mesmo processador do modelo 3 B+ assim como as melhorias térmicas deste ultimo. Com um preço base de 25 USD este novo modelo apenas trás 512MB de memória, uma porta USB 2.0 e não tem Ethernet. No entanto tem Dual-band 802.11ac Wifi e Bluetooth 4.2/BLE.</p>

<p>Ficámos hoje a saber que a SpaceX conseguiu mais um sucesso conseguindo fazer o lançamento de um satélite do Qatar e aterrando com sucesso. O Falcon 9 de dois estágios descolou às 3:46 da tarde. EST (2046 GMT) de hoje (15 de novembro) do complexo de lançamento 39A no Kennedy Space Center da NASA, na Florida. Cerca de 32 minutos depois, o foguetão libertou com sucesso sua carga, o satélite de comunicações Es'hail-2, numa órbita de transferência geo-estacionária elíptica.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como alguns modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis.</p>

<p><em>"TL;DR: you can now get the 1.4GHz clock speed, 5GHz wireless networking and improved thermals of Raspberry Pi 3B+ in a smaller form factor, and at the smaller price of $25. Meet the Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+. Long-time readers will recall that back in 2014 the original Raspberry Pi 1 Model B+ was followed closely by a cut-down Model A+. By halving the RAM to 256MB, and removing the USB hub and Ethernet controller, we were able to hit a lower price point, and squeeze the product down to the size of a HAT. Although we didn’t make A+ form-factor versions of Raspberry Pi 2 or 3, it has been one of our most frequently requested “missing” products. Now, with Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ shipping in volume, we’re able to fill that gap by releasing Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+."</em> <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/new-product-raspberry-pi-3-model-a/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A pre-flown SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket has aced another launch-and-landing mission. The two-stage Falcon 9 lifted off at 3:46 p.m. EST (2046 GMT) today (Nov. 15) from Launch Complex 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. About 32 minutes later, the rocket successfully deployed its payload, the Es'hail-2 communications satellite, into an elliptical geostationary transfer orbit. The rocket's first stage was already back on Earth at that point, standing tall on the deck of the SpaceX droneship "Of Course I Still Love You," which was stationed in the Atlantic Ocean off the Florida coast. The booster touched down on the robotic ship about 8.5 minutes after liftoff.

<p><em>"Elon Musk’s SpaceX won permission to deploy more than 7,000 satellites, far more than all operating spacecraft currently aloft, from U.S. regulators who also moved to reduce a growing risk from space debris as skies grow more crowded. Space Exploration Technologies Corp. has two test satellites aloft, and it earlier won permission for a separate set of 4,425 satellites -- which like the 7,518 satellites authorized Thursday are designed to provide broadband communications. It has said it plans to begin launches next year. Space companies riding innovations that include smaller and cheaper satellites -- with some just 4 inches long and weighing only 3 pounds -- are planning fleets that will fly fast and low, offering communications now commonly handled by larger, more expensive satellites. Right now there are fewer than 2,000 operating satellites, and the planned additional space traffic demands vigilance, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai said before the agency voted Thursday on a variety of space-related matters including SpaceX’s application, debris rules, and other space matters. “Even a centimeter-wide object can wreak devastating damage to satellites,” Pai said."</em> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-15/elon-musk-s-spacex-wins-fcc-approval-to-launch-7-000-satellites">[...]</a>

<p><em>"HTTP is switching to a protocol layered on top of UDP. The next version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)—the network protocol that defines how browsers talk to Web servers—is going to make a major break from the versions in use today. Today's HTTP (versions 1.0, 1.1, and 2) are all layered on top of TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). TCP, defined as part of the core set of IP (Internet Protocol) layers, provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data over an IP network. "Reliable" means that if some data goes missing during transfer (due to a hardware failure, congestion, or a timeout), the receiving end can detect this and demand that the sending end re-send the missing data; "ordered" means that data is received in the order that it was transmitted in; "error-checked" means that any corruption during transmission can be detected. These are all desirable properties and necessary for a protocol such as HTTP, but TCP is designed as a kind of one-size-fits-all solution, suitable for any application that needs this kind of reliability."</em> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/11/the-next-version-of-http-wont-be-using-tcp/">[...]</a>

The spacecraft passed the current record of 26.55 million miles from the Sun's surface on Oct. 29, 2018, at about 1:04 p.m. EDT, as calculated by the Parker Solar Probe team. The previous record for closest solar approach was set by the German-American Helios 2 spacecraft in April 1976. As the Parker Solar Probe mission progresses, the spacecraft will repeatedly break its own records, with a final close approach of 3.83 million miles from the Sun's surface expected in 2024. “It’s been just 78 days since Parker Solar Probe launched, and we’ve now come closer to our star than any other spacecraft in history,” said Project Manager Andy Driesman, from the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. “It’s a proud moment for the team, though we remain focused on our first solar encounter, which begins on Oct. 31.” Parker Solar Probe is also expected to break the record for fastest spacecraft traveling relative to the Sun on Oct. 29 at about 10:54 p.m. EDT."</em> <a href="http://parkersolarprobe.jhuapl.edu/News-Center/Show-Article.php?articleID=108">[...]</a>

<p><em>"SK Hynix Inc. (or ‘the Company’, www.skhynix.com) announced that it has developed 16Gb (Gigabits) DDR5 (Double Data Rate 5) DRAM, the industry’s first DDR5 to meet the JEDEC standards. The same 1Ynm process technology used for the recently-developed 1Ynm 8Gb DDR4 DRAM was applied to the new DRAM, giving an industry-leading competitive edge for the Company. DDR5 is a next-generation DRAM standard that offers ultra-high speed and high density with reduced power consumption as compared to DDR4, for use in data-intensive applications such as big data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. SK Hynix successfully lowered the operating voltage from 1.2V to 1.1V, achieving 30% lower power consumption compared to the previous generation, DDR4 DRAM. The new 16Gb DDR5 DRAM supports a data transfer rate of 5200Mbps, about 60% faster compared to 3200Mbps of the previous generation, with which it can process 41.6GB (Gigabytes) of data—11 full-HD video files (3.7GB each)—per second. The Company provided a major chipset maker with RDIMM (Registered Dual In-line Memory Module) and UDIMM (Unbuffered DIMM) for server and PC platforms, with more memory banks—doubled from 16 to 32 banks—in accordance with the JEDEC DDR5 standards."</em> <a href="https://www.skhynix.com/eng/pr/pressReleaseView.do?seq=2588&amp;offset=1">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The most luminous galaxy ever discovered is cannibalizing not one, not two, but at least three of its smaller neighbors, according to a new study published today (Nov. 15) in the journal Science and coauthored by scientists from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. The material that the galaxy is stealing from its neighbors is likely contributing to its uber-brightness, the study shows. Discovered by NASA's space-based Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) in 2015, the galaxy, called WISE J224607.55-052634.9, is by no means the largest or most massive galaxy we know of, but it radiates at 350 trillion times the luminosity of the Sun. If all galaxies were positioned an equal distance from us, WISE J224607.55-052634.9 (or W2246-0526 for short) would be the brightest. New observations using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile reveal distinct trails of dust being pulled from three smaller galaxies into W2246-0526. The trails contain about as much material as the smaller galaxies themselves, and it's unclear whether those galaxies will escape their current fate or will be completely consumed by their luminous neighbor."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7282">[...]</a>

For decades, physics assumed that the laws of nature in our world and in the mirror world would be identical, that parity would be preserved.

The improvement could pave the way for the development of graphene-based detectors that can quickly sense light at very low levels, such as those found in medical imaging, radiation detection, and surveillance applications. Graphene is a two-dimensional (2-D) nanomaterial with unusual and useful mechanical, optical, and electronic properties. It is both extremely thin and incredibly strong, detects light of almost any color, and conducts heat and electricity well. However, because graphene is made of sheets of carbon only one atom thick, it can only absorb a very small amount of incoming light (about two percent). One approach to overcoming this problem is to combine graphene with strong light-absorbing materials, such as organic compounds that conduct electricity."</em> <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=113185">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scientists to improve battery life by minimizing power consumption of apps by 60-percent The solution integrates mobile computing with cloud computing Parts of apps that use too much power can be automatically offloaded to the cloud Computer scientists from Aston University have developed a way to drastically improve the battery-life of mobile devices, such as smart phones and tablets, by minimising the power consumption of mobile apps by as much as 60-percent. The research, which is published in Transactions on Emerging Telecommunications Technologies Journal, presents a solution that integrates mobile computing with cloud computing, with tools developed to identify the most power hungry parts of a mobile app and then moves them to the cloud using a technique called code-oﬄoading. The scientists developed a mobile-cloud hybrid application framework for Android that hybridises mobile apps, executing them across both mobile and cloud platforms. Using the code-offloading technique the ‘power hungry’ parts of the mobile-cloud hybrid application are ﬁrst identiﬁed, and then oﬄoaded to the cloud and executed there, instead of on the device itself. As they execute on the cloud instead of the mobile device, the device’s own components are not used, power is saved which prolongs the battery life.

<p><em>"Injuries can’t heal without a constant influx of blood’s key ingredient — oxygen. A new flexible sensor developed by engineers at UC Berkeley can map blood-oxygen levels over large areas of skin, tissue and organs, potentially giving doctors a new way to monitor healing wounds in real time. “When you hear the word oximeter, the name for blood-oxygen sensors, rigid and bulky finger-clip sensors come into your mind,” said Yasser Khan, a graduate student in electrical engineering and computer sciences at UC Berkeley. “We wanted to break away from that, and show oximeters can be lightweight, thin and flexible.” The sensor, described this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is made of organic electronics printed on bendable plastic that molds to the contours of the body. Unlike fingertip oximeters, it can detect blood-oxygen levels at nine points in a grid and can be placed anywhere on the skin. It could potentially be used to map oxygenation of skin grafts, or to look through the skin to monitor oxygen levels in transplanted organs, the researchers say."</em> <a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2018/11/07/skin-like-sensor-maps-blood-oxygen-levels-anywhere-in-the-body/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The UK’s first quantum accelerometer for navigation has been demonstrated by a team from Imperial College London and M Squared. Most navigation today relies on a global navigation satellite system (GNSS), such as GPS, which sends and receives signals from satellites orbiting the Earth. The quantum accelerometer is a self-contained system that does not rely on any external signals. This is particularly important because satellite signals can become unavailable due to blockages such as tall buildings, or can be jammed, imitated or denied – preventing accurate navigation. One day of denial of the satellite service would cost the UK £1 billion. Now, for the first time, a UK team has demonstrated a transportable, standalone quantum accelerometer at the National Quantum Technologies Showcase, an event demonstrating the technological progress arising from the UK National Quantum Technologies Programme – a £270m UK Government investment over five years."</em> <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/188973/quantum-compass-could-allow-navigation-without/">[...]</a>

The researchers could show that by packing two atoms closely together they could protect their fragile quantum properties much better than for just one atom.

<p><em>"Researchers at The University of Texas at Arlington have filed a provisional patent application on a new copper compound that can be used to purify ethylene for use as a raw material in the production of plastics such as polyethylene or PVC, as well as other industrial compounds. Ethylene is produced from crude oil but is usually obtained as a mixture containing ethane. Manufacturing processes using ethylene usually require pure, or 99.9 percent, ethylene feed-stock. “Existing technologies to separate ethylene and ethane use enormous amounts of energy and require high levels of capital investment,” said Rasika Dias, UTA distinguished university professor of chemistry and biochemistry. “Our new technology uses a copper compound that can selectively absorb ethylene in the solid state, leaving ethane out, with the minimum amount of energy release,” he added. Ethylene absorption by the newly discovered copper complex is easily reversible, so the absorbed ethylene can then be released and recovered using mild temperature or pressure changes, resulting in the regeneration of the starting copper complex, which can be reused multiple times."</em> <a href="https://www.uta.edu/news/releases/2018/11/Rasika%20Dias%20patent%20application.php">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Most 3D printable parts are designed to limit overhangs to 45 degrees or less. That's because maker-style 3D printers (technically FDM) build each layer from the bottom up, fusing the current layer onto the previous, and if there's nothing below a layer, the plastic will sag (or worse yet, form a glob and potentially ruin your part). To get around the overhang limit, parts are often significantly modified (with chamfers to reduce overhangs) or support material is used to hold up sections that extend too far. But neither approach works all the time; sometimes you can't chamfer away the overhangs and/or rely on support material to bail you out.

<h2><a href="https://ka7oei.blogspot.com/2018/09/a-simple-8-channel-receiver-voting.html">A simple 8-channel receiver voting controller for enhanced repeater coverage and usability</a></h2>

<p><em>"One of the often-overlooked means of improving the coverage of an amateur radio repeater is the use of multiple receivers in a voting configuration. It's often the case that a user can hear the repeater fine, but for whatever reason cannot get back into it - particularly if they are using a portable radio (a handie-talkie) and a compromised antenna, such as a rubber duck antenna. By extending the reach of the receive portion of the system with several geographically disparate receivers on the same frequency the effective, usable coverage can be increased without the need to have a linked repeater system - which may require additional frequencies - and it reduces the necessity of the user to switch between linked repeaters to maintain coverage. While this article describes a specific 8-channel voting system, it should contain enough information to be able to implement a similar voting controller using other hardware. Why a voter? Why improve the receiver coverage without a commensurate improvement in transmitter coverage?"</em> <a href="https://ka7oei.blogspot.com/2018/09/a-simple-8-channel-receiver-voting.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"While working on a new project Ive came across a problem where I wanted to control the backlight and the contrast of an 1602 LCD display through an Arduino but the display was really flickery. In a typical use case, the display contrast is adjusted through a variable resistor as per the datasheet. In such case, through the resistor we can adjust the voltage that is seen on the V0 pin and the contrast is adjusted accordingly. With the Arduino, the best thing we can output is a PWM signal with a different cycle but unfortunately the module is not happy displaying that. Before going into the schematic how we can fix this, let me explain you the code that I’m using. The first thing we need to do is to include the Liquid Crystal library so we can connect to the display."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/1602-LCD-Contrast-Control-From-Arduino/">[...]</a>
