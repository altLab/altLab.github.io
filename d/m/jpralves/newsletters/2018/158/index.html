<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1788, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustin-Jean_Fresnel">Augustin-Jean Fresnel</a>. Este físico francês foi o primeiro a investigar o efeito da interferência da luz, com resultados conhecidos como franjas de Fresnel. Este trabalho decisivo, juntamente com outras experiências com luz polarizada, apoiou a teoria da luz de Thomas Young. Fresnel avançou a teoria das ondas identificando a luz como ondas transversais em vez das ondas longitudinais anteriormente assumidas por Young e Christiaan Huygens. O seu trabalho pioneiro em óptica incluiu mostrar que a luz branca é composta por um espectro de inúmeros comprimentos de onda que variam do vermelho ao mais curto comprimento de onde violeta. Ele também melhorou o sistema óptico de faróis de sinalização marítima substituindo reflectores de metal por lentes revolucionárias. Estas lentes foram posteriormente adoptadas para faróis de veículos automóveis, dispositivos para ampliar ecrans de televisão, semáforos, sistemas ópticos de aterragem em aeroportos e porta-aviões, etc.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1830, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois-Marie_Raoult">François-Marie Raoult</a>. Este químico francês formulou uma lei sobre soluções (chamada lei de Raoult) que permitiu determinar os pesos moleculares das substâncias dissolvidas.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1901, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Desmond_Bernal">John Desmond Bernal</a>. Este físico irlandês e cristalógrafo de raios-X contribuiu para a cristalografia de raios-X para determinar as estruturas atómicas de compostos sólidos. Depois de se formar em Cambridge, ele começou a pesquisar em 1923 na Royal Institution, em Londres, para William Henry Bragg, sobre a estrutura de grafite. Em 1927, ele voltou a Cambridge como o primeiro conferencista em cristalografia estrutural. O alcance da sua pesquisa expandiu-se em biologia molecular, a origem da vida e a estrutura e composição da crosta terrestre.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, e m 1903, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleg_Losev">Oleg Losev</a>. Este cientista e inventor russo fez descobertas significativas no campo de junções semicondutores. Embora nunca tenha conseguido concluir uma educação formal e nunca tenha ocupado um cargo de investigador, Losev realizou algumas das primeiras pesquisas sobre semicondutores, publicando 43 artigos e recebendo 16 "certificados de autor" (a versão soviética de patentes) para suas descobertas. Ele observou a emissão de luz das junções de contacto ponto-carborundum, o primeiro díodo emissor de luz (LED), fez a primeira pesquisa sobre elas, propôs a primeira teoria correta de como elas funcionavam e usou-as em aplicações práticas como electroluminescência. Ele explorou a resistência negativa nas junções semicondutores e foi o primeiro a usá-las na prática para amplificação, construindo os primeiros amplificadores de estado sólido, osciladores electrónicos e receptores de rádio super-heteródino, 25 anos antes da invenção do transístor. No entanto, os seus feitos foram negligenciados, e desconhecidos por meio século antes de ter sido reconhecido no final do século XX e início do século XXI.</p>

<p>Esta semana a Google apresentou o Android Things que é um sistema operativo que permite criar e manter dispositivos do Internet of Things em grande escala. Trata-se de uma plataforma robusta que faz o trabalho pesado com hardware certificado, Com APIs avançadas de programador e actualizações seguras de software gerido usando a infraestrutura de back-end da Google, para que se possa concentrar na criação do produto.  Foi anunciado o suporte para novos System-on-Modules (SoMs) baseados nas plataformas de hardware NXP i.MX8M, Qualcomm SDA212, Qualcomm SDA624 e MediaTek MT8516. Esses módulos são certificados para uso em produção com suporte de longo prazo garantido por três anos, facilitando a colocação de protótipos no mercado.</p>

<p><em>"The flying taxi scene is now a bustling place, but some are moving faster than others. Where some startups have taken years to move past the prototype stage, others are launching right into things. Workhorse first unveiled its Surefly flying car at the Paris Air Show in June last year, and has now sent it into the air with a person inside for the first time. Workhorse has a number of electric vehicles under development, including electric pickup trucks and delivery vans that launch drones from the roof to cover the last leg. The Surefly has to be the most ambitious, however, designed to use a mix of diesel and electricity to power eight contra-rotating propellors and carry up to 400 lb (180 kg) over a range of approximately 70 mi ( 112 km). Back in January, it received an Experimental Airworthiness Certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration, which enabled it to carry out controlled test flights in the US."</em> <a href="https://newatlas.com/surefly-manned-flight/54487/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"China’s Long March 8, one of the country’s future launchers, could have a reusable first stage, according to a statement made recently by a Chinese rocket designer. While not a lot of information has been disclosed so far by Beijing regarding its future boosters, Western experts expected that the new design would be an expendable rocket. The initial project called for a two-stage launch vehicle with an additional two or four solid rocket boosters. In such a configuration, the Long March 8 could be capable of lifting up to 4.5 metric tons into a Sun-synchronous orbit. However, more ambitious plans for this rocket were presented by Long Lehao, chief designer of carrier rockets at the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology (CALT), during an April 24, 2018, space conference in Harbin, China. According the state-run Xinhua press agency, Lehao said the first stage and boosters of the Long March 8 are expected to be retrieved through vertical landing, adding that if the project succeeds, the new partly-reusable rocket would provide commercial launch services to customers around the globe."</em> <a href="http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/organizations/china-national-space-administration/china-developing-a-reusable-launch-vehicle/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"As the war for creating customized AI hardware heats up, Google announced at Google I/O 2018 that is rolling out out its third generation of silicon, the Tensor Processor Unit 3.0. Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the new TPU pod is eight times more powerful than last year, with up to 100 petaflops in performance. Google joins pretty much every other major company in looking to create custom silicon in order to handle its machine operations. And while multiple frameworks for developing machine learning tools have emerged, including PyTorch and Caffe2, this one is optimized for Google’s TensorFlow. Google is looking to make Google Cloud an omnipresent platform at the scale of Amazon, and offering better machine learning tools is quickly becoming table stakes. Amazon and Facebook are both working on their own kind of custom silicon."</em> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/08/google-announces-a-new-generation-for-its-tpu-machine-learning-hardware/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Engineers from Texas A&amp;M University and Virginia Tech report important new insights into nanoporous gold–a material with growing applications in several areas, including energy storage and biomedical devices–all without stepping into a lab. Instead of conducting any additional experiments, the team used image-analysis software developed in-house to “mine” the existing literature on nanoporous gold (NPG). Specifically, the software analyzed photographs of NPG from some 150 peer-reviewed papers, quickly measuring key features of the material that the researchers then correlated with written descriptions of how the samples were prepared. One of the results? A recipe, of sorts, for how to make NPG with specific characteristics. “We were able to back out a quantitative law that explains how you can change NPG features by changing the processing times and temperatures,” said Ian McCue, a postdoctoral researcher in the Texas A&amp;M Department of Materials Science and Engineering."</em> <a href="https://today.tamu.edu/2018/05/03/mining-for-gold-with-a-computer/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="http://news.ufl.edu/articles/2018/04/watching-nanomaterials-form-in-4d.php">Watching nanomaterials form in 4D</a></h2>

<p><em>"Novel technology allows researchers to see dynamic reactions as they happen at the nanoscale When famed physicists Max Knoll and Ernst Ruska first introduced the transmission electron microscope (TEM) in 1933, it allowed researchers to peer inside cells, microorganisms and particles that were once too small to study. For decades, these high-powered instruments had been limited to taking static snapshots of specimens, which only tell part of the story. Now researchers from Northwestern University and the University of Florida are filling in the blanks to make this story more complete. The team is part of an effort to develop a new type of TEM that takes dynamic, multi-frame videos of nanoparticles as they form, allowing researchers to view how specimens change in space and time. Knowing how these particles form could change how researchers design future drug-delivery systems, paints, coatings, lubricants and other materials for which having control over nanoscale properties can lead to large effects on macroscale materials. “We have demonstrated that TEM does not have to be a microscopy method solely used to analyze what happened after the fact — after a reaction ends,” said Nathan Gianneschi, professor of chemistry, biomedical engineering and materials science and engineering at Northwestern, who co-led the study."</em> <a href="http://news.ufl.edu/articles/2018/04/watching-nanomaterials-form-in-4d.php">[...]</a>

<p><em>"First demonstration of self-assembling and self-disassembling silicon microparticles could form the basis for designing artificial muscles and reconfigurable computer systems Researchers at Duke University and North Carolina State University have demonstrated the first custom semiconductor microparticles that can be steered into various configurations repeatedly while suspended in water. With an initial six custom particles that predictably interact with one another in the presence of alternating current (AC) electric fields of varying frequencies, the study presents the first steps toward realizing advanced applications such as artificial muscles and reconfigurable computer systems. The study appears online on May 3 in the journal Nature Communications. “We’ve engineered and encoded multiple dynamic responses in different microparticles to create a reconfigurable silicon toolbox,” said Ugonna Ohiri, a recently graduated electrical engineering doctoral student from Duke and first author of the paper. “By providing a means of controllably assembling and disassembling these particles, we’re bringing a new tool to the field of active matter.” While previous researchers have worked to define self-assembling systems, few have worked with semiconductor particles, and none have explored the wide range of custom shapes, sizes and coatings that are available to the micro- and nanofabrication industry. Engineering particles from silicon presents the opportunity to physically realize electronic devices that can self-assemble and disassemble on demand."</em> <a href="https://pratt.duke.edu/about/news/custom-silicon-microparticles">[...]</a>

Manipulating the flow of energy through superconductors – materials that conduct electricity with 100 percent efficiency – could radically transform technology, perhaps leading to applications such as ultrafast, highly efficient quantum computers. But that will require a detailed understanding of the energy flow and how it is affected by the interactions of electrons and atomic nuclei in superconducting materials. Now a research team, including scientists from the Department of Energy’s Brookhaven National Laboratory and SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, has observed those interactions for the first time in copper-oxide superconductors. Using a combination of experimental techniques, including an ultra-high-speed “electron camera” at SLAC, they were able to measure the rapid interplay between atomic motions and changes in electron energy and momentum. “This breakthrough offers direct, fundamental insight into the puzzling characteristics of these remarkable materials,” said Brookhaven Lab scientist Yimei Zhu, who led the research."</em> <a href="https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/news/2018-05-02-ultrafast-atomic-snapshots-reveal-energy-flow-superconductor.aspx">[...]</a>

Although helical structures are typically formed by magnetic moments that wind around an axis in a set direction, the researchers discovered that Fe3PO7 does not pick a particular direction and allows only short-range helical structures to form. These structures may provide novel technological capabilities. “Because the direction of the helix is varying in space, it has what we call a partial order, which means there is no set direction for the helical axis to point,” said assistant professor Kate Ross, who is also a former chair of ORNL’s SNS-HFIR User Group.

<p><em>"New principled approach helps autonomous underwater vehicles explore the ocean in an intelligent, energy-efficient manner. Observing the world’s oceans is increasingly a mission assigned to autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) — marine robots that are designed to drift, drive, or glide through the ocean without any real-time input from human operators. Critical questions that AUVs can help to answer are where, when, and what to sample for the most informative data, and how to optimally reach sampling locations. MIT engineers have now developed systems of mathematical equations that forecast the most informative data to collect for a given observing mission, and the best way to reach the sampling sites. With their method, the researchers can predict the degree to which one variable, such as the speed of ocean currents at a certain location, reveals information about some other variable, such as temperature at some other location — a quantity called “mutual information.” If the degree of mutual information between two variables is high, an AUV can be programmed to go to certain locations to measure one variable, to gain information about the other. The team used their equations and an ocean model they developed, called Multidisciplinary Simulation, Estimation, and Assimilation Systems (MSEAS), in sea experiments to successfully forecast fields of mutual information and guide actual AUVs."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2018/fundamental-equations-guide-marine-robots-optimal-sampling-sites-0510">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://today.uconn.edu/2018/05/strain-improves-performance-atomically-thin-semiconductor-material/">Strain Improves Performance of Atomically Thin Semiconductor Material</a></h2>

<p><em>"Researchers in UConn’s Institute of Materials Science significantly improved the performance of an atomically thin semiconductor material by stretching it, an accomplishment that could prove beneficial to engineers designing the next generation of flexible electronics, nano devices, and optical sensors. In a study appearing in the research journal Nano Letters, Michael Pettes, assistant professor of mechanical engineering, reports that a six-atom thick bilayer of tungsten diselenide exhibited a 100-fold increase in photoluminescence when it was subjected to strain. The material had never exhibited such photoluminescence before. The findings mark the first time scientists have been able to conclusively show that the properties of atomically thin materials can be mechanically manipulated to enhance their performance, Pettes says. Such capabilities could lead to faster computer processors and more efficient sensors. The process the researchers used to achieve the outcome is also significant in that it offers a reliable new methodology for measuring the impact of strain on ultrathin materials, something that has been difficult to do and a hindrance to innovation."</em> <a href="https://today.uconn.edu/2018/05/strain-improves-performance-atomically-thin-semiconductor-material/">[...]</a>

As predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity, objects of mass distort the fabric of spacetime. Blackholes are points of such immense density that spacetime is distorted so much that neither light nor matter can escape. To recreate this effect I have used a piece of black lycra to represent the fabric of spacetime, around the edge the event horizon is displayed by a ring of white LEDs; any closer to the blackhole and light would be unable to escape. The longer you leave the lamp on, the bigger the blackhole grows since it is consuming more matter and energy.

<p><em>"Hi guys. Wellcome back to a new awesome tutorial. POV or persistance of vision refers to the optical illusion that occurs when visual perception of an object does not cease for some time after the rays of light proceeding from it have ceased to enter the eye. The illusion has also been described as "retinal persistence", "persistence of impressions", simply "persistence" and other variations. In this project we will learn how to use a Hall sensor in order to detect rotations. We will count the time it takes to make a full rotation of the POV propeller and by dividing the measured value by 360 we get time per degree."</em> <a href="http://www.electronoobs.com/eng_arduino_tut21.php">[...]</a>

The simplest solution is just to connect it to a battery or some kind of power supply and that's ok but what if you want to control motor speed for example by PWM? You have to use Arduino with motor controller, connect all of that, program it and then you can use it, but that's a lot of work. What if there is simpler solution for that. So I started thinking if I can use something else then microcontroller to create PWM signal, and I thought about world's most popular integrated circuit (IC) the 555 timer.

They’re available for a few cents each, and their resistance varies based on how much light they receive. In the dark, these devices produce resistances in the megohm range, and can fall to hundreds of ohms or even less when exposed to sufficient light. You first instinct when prototyping this type of device is likely to use an analog input on an Arduino or similar dev board to sense voltage levels. This works quite well in many situations, but you may also want to consider a comparator or operational amplifier (op-amp) to turn this analog input into a simple on/off signal. You could also use one of these components by itself to produce a usable output without the use of a microcontroller."</em> <a href="http://www.electronics-lab.com/use-comparator-op-amp-simplify-light-dependent-resistor-output/">[...]</a>
