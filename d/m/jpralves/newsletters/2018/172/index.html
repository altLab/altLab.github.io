<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1821, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Cayley">Arthur Cayley</a>. Este Matemático inglês desempenhou um papel de liderança na fundação da moderna escola britânica de matemática pura. Ele treinou primeiro como advogado e, desde 1849, passou 14 anos no bar, período durante o qual manteve um interesse pela matemática e publicou cerca de 250 artigos matemáticos. Em 1863, Cayley seguiu sua paixão e iniciou uma nova carreira como professor de Matemática Pura em Cambridge e durante seu mandato publicou 900 artigos e notas cobrindo quase todos os aspectos da matemática moderna. O legado de seu trabalho na geometria n-dimensional foi posteriormente aplicado na física ao estudo do contínuo espaço-temporal. O seu trabalho em matrizes serviu de base para a mecânica quântica desenvolvida por Werner Heisenberg em 1925.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1845, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Lippmann">Gabriel Lippmann</a>. Foi um físico francês que recebeu o Prémio Nobel da Física em 1908 por produzir a primeira chapa fotográfica colorida. Lippmann foi um gigante do seu tempo na pesquisa de física clássica, especialmente em óptica e electricidade. Ele trabalhou em Berlim com o famoso Hermann von Helmholtz antes de se instalar em Paris para dirigir (em 1886) os Laboratórios de Pesquisa Física da Sorbonne até sua morte. As suas invenções incluem um instrumento para medir com precisão as diferenças mínimas em energia eléctrica e o “coleostat” para fotografias celestes firmes e de longa exposição.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1884, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Gernsback">Hugo Gernsback</a>. Este Inventor norte-americano e editor foi em grande parte responsável pelo estabelecimento da ficção científica como uma forma literária independente. Hugo fundou a estação de rádio WRNY, esteve envolvido nas primeiras transmissões de televisão e é considerado um pioneiro em rádio amador. Em 1926, como proprietário de uma revista, a Modern Electrics, ele preencheu um espaço em branco da sua publicação ao lançar o primeiro capítulo de uma série chamada "Ralph 124C 41+". "Ralph" foi um sucesso incrível. A história de 12 partes foi preenchida com todos os tipos de invenções selvagens inéditas em 1926, incluindo televisão (ele é creditado com a introdução desta palavra), iluminação fluorescente, juke boxes, energia solar, televisão, microfilme, máquinas de venda automática e um dispositivo que agora se chama de radar.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1904, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendell_Meredith_Stanley">Wendell Meredith Stanley</a>. Este Bioquímico norte-americano recebeu em 1946 (com John Northrop e James Sumner) o Prémio Nobel de Química pelo seu trabalho na purificação e cristalização de vírus, demonstrando assim a sua estrutura molecular. Impressionado pelo sucesso de John Northrop em cristalizar proteínas, Stanley aplicou essas técnicas nos seus extractos do vírus mosaico do tabaco (TMV). Em 1935, ele tinha obtido cristais finos semelhantes a hastes do vírus e demonstrou que o TMV ainda retinha sua infectividade após a cristalização, a primeira de tal purificação de um vírus. No início, alguns cientistas eram cépticos - pensando que os vírus, sendo semelhantes aos organismos vivos convencionais, não poderiam existir na forma cristalina. Stanley então acreditou, incorrectamente, que a proteína era o agente activo do vírus. Durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial, ele trabalhou no isolamento do vírus da influenza e preparou uma vacina contra ele. Em 1936, ele isolou os ácidos nucléicos do vírus mosaico do tabaco, que foram encontrados mais tarde (1955) para causar a actividade viral.</p>

<p>Faz hoje 25 anos que a distribuição de linux Debian foi criada. Quando o falecido Ian Murdock fez o anuncio no grupo de news comp.os.linux.development, "a iminente conclusão de um novo lançamento [...] do Linux, o Debian Linux Release", ninguém esperaria "o lançamento Debian Linux "para se tornar o que hoje em dia é conhecido como o Projeto Debian, um dos maiores e mais influentes projectos de software livre. O seu principal produto é o Debian, um sistema operativo livre (SO) para o seu computador, bem como para muitos outros sistemas que melhoram sua vida. Do funcionamento interno do aeroporto próximo ao sistema de entretenimento do carro e dos servidores na Cloud que hospedam os seus sites favoritos aos dispositivos de IoT que se comunicam com eles, o Debian pode ser usado em todos eles.</p>

<p>Esta semana também ficámos a saber que a NASA tenta, sem sucesso, contacto com o Opportunity Rover desde 10 de Junho, quando uma tempestade de poeira envolvendo o planeta cortou a energia solar do rover de quase 15 anos. Agora que os cientistas acham que a tempestade global de poeira está "decaindo" - o que significa que mais poeira está caindo da atmosfera do que está sendo levantada de volta - os céus podem ficar claros o suficiente para que o veículo movido a energia solar possa recarregar e tente "telefonar". casa. Aguardemos que tenha sucesso.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker.</p>

<p><em>"When the late Ian Murdock announced 25 years ago in comp.os.linux.development, "the imminent completion of a brand-new Linux release, [...] the Debian Linux Release", nobody would have expected the "Debian Linux Release" to become what's nowadays known as the Debian Project, one of the largest and most influential free software projects. Its primary product is Debian, a free operating system (OS) for your computer, as well as for plenty of other systems which enhance your life. From the inner workings of your nearby airport to your car entertainment system, and from cloud servers hosting your favorite websites to the IoT devices that communicate with them, Debian can power it all. Today, the Debian project is a large and thriving organization with countless self-organized teams comprised of volunteers. While it often looks chaotic from the outside, the project is sustained by its two main organizational documents: the Debian Social Contract, which provides a vision of improving society, and the Debian Free Software Guidelines, which provide an indication of what software is considered usable. They are supplemented by the project's Constitution which lays down the project structure, and the Code of Conduct, which sets the tone for interactions within the project."</em> <a href="https://bits.debian.org/2018/08/debian-is-25.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7215">Six Things About Opportunity's Recovery Efforts</a></h2>

<p><em>"NASA's Opportunity rover has been silent since June 10, when a planet-encircling dust storm cut off solar power for the nearly-15-year-old rover. Now that scientists think the global dust storm is "decaying" -- meaning more dust is falling out of the atmosphere than is being raised back into it -- skies might soon clear enough for the solar-powered rover to recharge and attempt to "phone home." No one will know how the rover is doing until it speaks. But the team notes there's reason to be optimistic: They've performed several studies on the state of its batteries before the storm, and temperatures at its location. Because the batteries were in relatively good health before the storm, there's not likely to be too much degradation. And because dust storms tend to warm the environment -- and the 2018 storm happened as Opportunity's location on Mars entered summer -- the rover should have stayed warm enough to survive."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7215">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Hybrid Rendering Fundamentally Changes Computer Graphics by Fusing Real-Time Ray Tracing, AI, Simulation and Rasterization NVIDIA today reinvented computer graphics with the launch of the NVIDIA Turing™ GPU architecture. The greatest leap since the invention of the CUDA GPU in 2006, Turing features new RT Cores to accelerate ray tracing and new Tensor Cores for AI inferencing which, together for the first time, make real-time ray tracing possible. These two engines — along with more powerful compute for simulation and enhanced rasterization — usher in a new generation of hybrid rendering to address the $250 billion visual effects industry. Hybrid rendering enables cinematic-quality interactive experiences, amazing new effects powered by neural networks and fluid interactivity on highly complex models. The company also unveiled its initial Turing-based products — the NVIDIA® Quadro® RTX™ 8000, Quadro RTX 6000 and Quadro RTX 5000 GPUs — which will revolutionize the work of some 50 million designers and artists across multiple industries. “Turing is NVIDIA’s most important innovation in computer graphics in more than a decade,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA, speaking at the start of the annual SIGGRAPH conference."</em> <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-reinvents-computer-graphics-with-turing-architecture">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scientists achieve highest ratio of acceleration to deceleration in plasma wakes yet Scientists at DESY have achieved a milestone towards the usability of novel, plasma-based particle accelerators. Using the electron beam of the PITZ accelerator, the Photo Injector Test facility at DESY's Zeuthen site, DESY physicist Frank Stephan and his group, as part of the LAOLA collaboration, accelerated electrons in a plasma wake with an enhanced ratio between acceleration of the witness and deceleration of the driver beam. This so-called transformer ratio defines the achievable energy gain in such a plasma accelerator. Their results are now being published in the journal Physical Review Letters. Plasma-based particle acceleration is a novel accelerator technology which utilizes the possibility to achieve accelerating field strengths in a plasma which exceed those of conventional accelerators by three orders of magnitude. In the case of the Plasma Wakefield Acceleration scheme, a pair of two electron bunches are shot into an ionized gas (plasma) where the first, highly energetic “driver”-bunch drives a plasma wake."</em> <a href="http://www.desy.de/news/news_search/index_eng.html?openDirectAnchor=1442">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers from UNIGE have developed a new type of chemical sensor capable of detecting the presence of metals in the environment. An international team, led by researchers from the University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland, has designed a family of molecules capable of binding to metal ions present in its environment and providing an easily detectable light signal during binding. This new type of sensor forms a 3D structure whose molecules are chiral, that is to say structurally identical but not superimposable, like an image and its reflection in a mirror, or like the left and right hands. These molecules consist of a ring and two luminescent arms that emit a particular type of light in a process called Circular Polarized Luminescence (CPL), and selectively detect ions, such as sodium. This research can be read about in Chemical Science. "The luminescent arms of our molecules function like light bulbs that light up or turn off depending on the presence of a positively charged ion, a metal cation," explains Jérôme Lacour, Dean of the Faculty of Science at UNIGE and Ordinary Professor in the Department of Organic Chemistry."</em> <a href="https://www.unige.ch/communication/communiques/en/2018/un-interrupteur-moleculaire-detecte-les-metaux-dans-lenvironnement/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Purdue University researchers have developed transistor technology that shows potential for improving computers and mobile phones. The researchers created a new technology design for field effect transistors, which are basic switching devices in computers and other electronic devices. Those types of transistors also are promising candidates for next generation nanodevices. They can offer better switching behavior for computers and devices compared with traditional field effect transistors. “Our technology is unique because it merges lasers and transistors,” said Tillmann Kubis, research assistant professor in Purdue's School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Network for Computational Nanotechnology and Purdue Center for Predictive Materials and Devices. “There is traditionally not a lot of overlap between these two areas, even though the combination can be powerful with the Internet of Things and other related fields.” The combination of the quantum cascade laser and transistor technologies into a single design concept will help manufacturers of integrated circuits who want to build smaller and more transistors per unit area."</em> <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2018/Q3/transistor-technology-may-improve-speed,-battery-life-for-computers,-mobile-phones-and-other-electronics.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/187628/surprise-slow-electrons-produced-when-intense/">Surprise slow electrons are produced when intense lasers hit clusters of atoms</a></h2>

<p><em>"Scientists found that relatively slow electrons are produced when intense lasers interact with small clusters of atoms, overturning current theories. Intense laser cluster interactions occur when small clusters of atoms, nanometres (billionths of a metre) in size, are struck with intense lasers. This happens, for example, when imaging biomedical samples on ultrafast timescales. However, the biomolecules can be damaged in this process by radiation. The discovery of slow, low-energy electrons produced by the intense laser cluster interactions provides a missing link in scientists’ understanding of the process, and could explain why biomolecules are damaged. Intense laser cluster interactions were known to produce energetic ions and electrons, but now, in a paper published today in Physical Review Letters, researchers have revealed that relatively slow electrons are also produced in large quantities."</em> <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/187628/surprise-slow-electrons-produced-when-intense/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"asers are widely used as high power sources of light operating at a specific frequency. But how does this frequency get selected when a laser is turned on, and how quickly? Pioneering engineers using terahertz frequency technology have been able to investigate this process for the first time. Their results will underpin the future development of semiconductor lasers, including those used in public and private sector-owned telecommunications systems. For many years, it has been predicted that operating frequencies within semiconductor lasers stabilise on a timescale of a few nanoseconds (ie a few billionths of a second) and can be changed within a few hundreds of picoseconds (ie thousandths of a nanosecond). Until now though, no detector has been capable of measuring and proving this precisely, and the best results have only been achieved on nanosecond timescales, which are too slow to allow really efficient analysis or to be used to develop the most effective new systems."</em> <a href="http://www.leeds.ac.uk/news/article/4275/shining_a_light_on_the_operation_of_lasers">[...]</a>

The new structures were built inside the pores of zeolites, crystalline forms of silicon dioxide – sand – more commonly used as water softeners in laundry detergents and to catalytically crack petroleum into gasoline. Called zeolite-templated carbons (ZTC), the structures were being investigated for possible interesting properties, though the creators were unaware of their identity as schwarzites, which theoretical chemists have worked on for decades. Based on this theoretical work, chemists predict that schwarzites will have unique electronic, magnetic and optical properties that would make them useful as supercapacitors, battery electrodes and catalysts, and with large internal spaces ideal for gas storage and separation."</em> <a href="http://news.berkeley.edu/2018/08/13/long-sought-carbon-structure-joins-graphene-fullerene-family/">[...]</a>

Their ‘hybrid-electric-hydrogen’ flow battery, based upon the design of a nanoscale battery molecule can store energy, releasing the power on demand as electric power or hydrogen gas that can be used a fuel. When a concentrated liquid containing the nano-molecules is made, the amount of energy it can store increases by almost 10 times.

In the Optical Society (OSA) journal Optics Letters, researchers report on a sensor that detects pressure by analyzing changes in the amount of light traveling through tiny tunnels embedded in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a common type of silicone. The flexible, transparent device is sensitive to even gentle pressure and is less prone to failure compared to previous types of pressure sensors. It also should be feasible to incorporate the embedded optical sensors across a large surface area, researchers say. “The silicone sheet can be placed on display panels to enable touch screens, or can be wrapped on robot surfaces as an artificial skin layer for tactile interactions,” says Suntak Park, Electronic and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea. “Considering that PDMS is a very well-known bio-compatible, non-toxic material, the sensor sheet may even be applied on or inside the human body, for example, to monitor blood pressure.” Measuring pressure distribution over a curved surface can be important in research areas such as aerodynamics and fluid dynamics."</em> <a href="https://www.osa.org/en-us/about_osa/newsroom/news_releases/2018/optical_pressure_detector_could_improve_robot_skin/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The Micro:bit is a nifty micro-controller unit for beginners learning about physical computing. It is rather simple to connect different sensors to one of its analog pins and use it to control an output. However, for those familiar with this device, debugging sensor values (particularly analog sensors like photoresistors) can be quite tricky. Establishing a USB serial connection between the micro:bit and a laptop is not straightforward; and using Bluetooth to transmit messages to a mobile app can be rather finicky too. Perhaps the most common way to debug sensor values when using the Micro:bit is to print the values onto the 5x5 on-board LED matrix. Waiting for the numbers to scroll across the screen can be frustratingly slow, and difficult to read (for me at least!)."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Microbit-Displaying-Values-Like-an-Abacus/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"While building Arduino or any other microcontroller platform project over time the need will arise to establish communication between two of the Arduino boards or microcontrollers for data exchange and/or control. This communication could be achieved using either wired or wireless process. For wireless communication between devices, quite a number of options exist including WiFi, GSM/GPRS, Bluetooth, RF and more recent technologies like LoRaWAN among others. All of these communication protocols have their pros and cons and the situation is in which they are the best fit. For mid-range communication between two microcontrollers, for example, one of the most suitable communication protocol is RF (radio frequency) as it has a good cost to performance ratio and a very good communication range can be attained using certain modules. Today, we will look at the radio frequency based communication between microcontrollers using one of the most popular RF communication modules; the NRF24LO1 communication module."</em> <a href="http://www.electronics-lab.com/project/communication-between-two-arduinos-using-nrf24l01/">[...]</a>

In this article I explain how this circuit is implemented, using analog and digital circuitry to create a negative voltage. Intel introduced the 8087 chip in 1980 to improve floating-point performance on 8086/8088 computers such as the original IBM PC. Since early microprocessors were designed to operate on integers, arithmetic on floating point numbers was slow, and transcendental operations such as trig or logarithms were even worse. But the 8087 co-processor greatly improved floating point speed, up to 100 times faster. The 8087's architecture became part of later Intel processors, and the 8087's instructions are still a part of today's x86 desktop computers.1 I opened up an 8087 chip and took die photos with a microscope yielding the composite photo below."</em> <a href="http://www.righto.com/2018/08/inside-die-of-intels-8087-coprocessor.html">[...]</a>
