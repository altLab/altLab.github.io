<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1879, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Willans_Richardson">Owen Willans Richardson</a>. Este físico inglês recebeu o Prémio Nobel de Física em 1928 pelo “seu trabalho sobre o fenómeno termiônico [emissões de electrões por metais quentes] e especialmente pela descoberta da lei que tem o seu nome”. Esse é o motivo pelo qual um filamento aquecido no tubo de vácuo liberta uma corrente de electrões em direcção ao ânodo, que era essencial para o desenvolvimento de aplicações como amplificadores de rádio ou o tubo de raios catódicos de TV. A lei de Richardson relaciona matematicamente como a emissão de electrões aumenta à medida que a temperatura absoluta da superfície do metal também aumenta. Ele também conduziu pesquisas sobre efeitos fotoeléctricos, o efeito giro-magnético, a emissão de electrões por reacções químicas, raios-X moles e o espectro do hidrogénio.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1900, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Francis_Richter">Charles Richter</a>. Este sismólogo americano ficou conhecido por ter criado a Escala Richter que mede a magnitude dos terremotos. Ele desenvolveu esta escala, conjuntamente com o seu colega Beno Gutenberg, no início dos anos 1930. A escala atribui classificações numéricas à energia libertada pelos terramotos. Richter usou um sismógrafo para registar o movimento real da Terra durante um terramoto. Trata-se de um instrumento que geralmente consiste num rolo de papel em constante desenrolamento, preso a um lugar fixo, e um pêndulo ou imã suspenso com um dispositivo de marcação acima do rolo. A escala leva em conta a distância do instrumento ao epicentro. Gutenberg sugeriu que a escala fosse logarítmica assim, por exemplo, um terremoto de magnitude 7 seria dez vezes mais forte do que um 6.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1933, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_Allan_Penzias">Arno Allan Penzias</a>. Este astrofísico germano-americano dividiu metade do Prémio Nobel de Física de 1978 com Robert Woodrow Wilson pela descoberta de uma fraca radiação electromagnética em todo o universo. A sua detecção desta radiação deu forte suporte ao modelo de evolução cósmica do Big Bang.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a conhecer o projecto da Asratec que está a desenvolver um "Transformer" totalmente funcional com 4 metros de altura. O J-deite RIDE é um robô que pode se transformar de uma forma humanóide bípede (modo robô) para uma forma accionada por rodas (modo veículo) e para trás. Tem a capacidade para duas pessoas e pode ser operada a partir do banco do condutor. Também pode ser operado por controle remoto via wifi. A BRAVE ROBOTICS projectou e desenvolveu o hardware, incluindo o exclusivo mecanismo de transformação, e o sistema de controle do robô da Asratec, o “V-Sido”, executa os movimentos do robô, como a transformação, a marcha bípede, a direcção e muito mais. O designer mecânico Kunio Okawara colaborou no design do robô.</p>

<p>Foi hoje lançada a nova versão do sistema Linux da Canonical - o Ubuntu. Com o nome de código Bionic Beaver esta versão é uma versão LTS (Long Time Support) e como principais novidades tem o Kernel Linux 4.15, o libreoffice foi actualizado para a versão 6.0, o calendário suporta previsões do tempo, algumas ferramentas foram empacotadas no formato snap, o GNOME Shell suporta o Thunderbolt 3, entre outras novidades. Esta newsletter foi escrita com o Geany em cima de um Ubuntu 18.04.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. São apresentadas as revistas HackSpace magazine #6, a newelectronics de 24 de Abril e a MagPI 69 de Maio.</p>

<p><em>"STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM), a global semiconductor leader serving customers across the spectrum of electronics applications, and Jorjin Technologies Inc., a Taipei, Taiwan based company established in 1997 to design and supply modules worldwide, today announced the certification of the dual-radio modules that combine Sigfox™ wireless-network technology with Bluetooth low energy (BLE). STMicroelectronics and Jorjin Introduce Ultra-Low-Power Sigfox IoT Modules with Dual RF Connectivity Jorjin’s WS211x Sigfox/BLE modules benefit from the market-leading performance and energy efficiency of ST’s BlueNRG-1 BLE System-on-Chip (SoC) and the S2-LP sub-1GHz RF transceiver. These advantages have enabled Jorjin’s modules to deliver cutting-edge connectivity and great battery lifetime, targeting coin-cell -operated or energy-harvesting IoT applications. Fully programmable devices, Jorjin’s new Sigfox modules exploit the ultra-low power Arm® Cortex®-M0 technology embedded in ST’s BLE SoC to act as independent IoT connectivity nodes. The combination of BLE with Sigfox’ low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) provides key benefits to IoT systems, such as firmware update over-the-air, which is not possible with conventional ‘Sigfox-only’ modules. Other benefits of having an IoT device connected both remotely through the Sigfox network and locally through BLE include the possibility to modify device settings during installation or maintenance, or to trace assets, which often change their position inside an area covered with BLE beacon stations."</em> <a href="http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/about/media-center/press-item.html/t4040.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"At Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), researchers have developed a flexible and efficient concept to combine optical components in compact systems. They use a high-resolution 3D printing process to produce tiny beam-shaping elements directly on optical microchips or fibers and, hence, enable low-loss coupling. This approach replaces complicated positioning processes that represent a high obstacle to many applications today. The scientists present their concept in the Nature Photonics journal (DOI: 10.1038/s41566-018-0133-4). In view of constantly growing data traffic, communication with light is gaining importance. For many years now, computing centers and worldwide telecommunication networks have been using optical connections for the quick and energy-efficient transmission of large amounts of data."</em> <a href="https://www.kit.edu/kit/english/pi_2018_23543.php">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.llnl.gov/news/powerful-new-source-high-energy-protons">A powerful new source of high-energy protons</a></h2>

<p><em>"Nearly 20 years ago, researchers conducting experiments on Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's (LLNL) Nova Petawatt laser system -- the world’s first quadrillion-watt laser -- discovered that when the system’s intense short-pulse laser beams struck a thin foil target, an unexpected torrent of high-energy electrons and protons streamed off the back of the target. Earlier this month, an international team of researchers used the Nova Petawatt’s successor, the National Ignition Facility's (NIF) petawatt-class Advanced Radiographic Capability (ARC), to begin developing an experimental platform that promises to turn Nova’s surprise discovery into a powerful new source of protons to study the extreme conditions deep inside the planets and the stars, enhance targeted tumor therapy and advance the frontiers of high energy density (HED) science. In two NIF Discovery Science experiments, the researchers fired four ARC beamlets at a 33-micron-thick titanium foil, setting up a strong electrostatic sheath field called a Target Normal Sheath Accelerating (TNSA) field perpendicular to the target (normal is a geometric term for perpendicular). As the field blew away from the back of the target, it accelerated high-energy protons and ions from the contamination layer of proton-rich hydrocarbons and water coating the target’s surface, all moving rapidly in the same direction. “The results were as good as we had hoped for,” said LLNL physicist Tammy Ma, the campaign’s principal investigator. “It was definitely a win."</em> <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/news/powerful-new-source-high-energy-protons">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The pull-up, an exercise dreaded by most, answers a basic question: are your muscles strong enough to lift your own body weight? Some Illinois researchers working on artificial muscles are seeing results even the fittest individuals would envy, designing muscles capable of lifting up to 12,600 times their own weight. MechSE assistant professor Sameh Tawfick, Beckman postdoctoral fellow Caterina Lamuta, and Simon Messelot recently published a study on how to design super strong artificial muscles in the journal Smart Material and Structures. The new muscles are made from carbon fiber-reinforced siloxane rubber and have a coiled geometry. These muscles are capable of not only lifting up to 12,600 times their own weight, but also supporting up to 60 MPa of mechanical stress, providing tensile strokes higher than 25% and specific work of up to 758 J/kg. This amount is 18 times more than the specific work natural muscles are capable of producing."</em> <a href="https://mechanical.illinois.edu/news/strong-carbon-fiber-artificial-muscles-can-lift-12600-times-their-own-weight">[...]</a>

<p><em>"An exact mathematical solution reveals how to tilt a laser pulse and move intensity peaks at faster than the speed of light, or even backwards A breakthrough in the mathematical solution for manipulating pulses of light clarifies the physics of ‘tilted’ laser pulses, and shows how they can be used to produce exotic effects1. The solution, developed by researchers from A*STAR and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), could advance applications such as terahertz lasers, X-ray generation and ultrafast electron imaging. Pulsed lasers are commonly used in industrial and research applications to deliver precision doses of high-intensity laser energy, which for example can prevent the target from being damaged while still heating or exciting it to a certain energy state. Some of the latest techniques use ultrashort pulses which last just a few femtoseconds — one quadrillionth of a second — to excite atoms and molecules and observe how they respond. One of the methods used to enhance the interaction between a laser pulse and the target atom or molecule is to tilt the wavefront of the pulse so that the energy delivery becomes slightly spread over time and in space, like the angle on the blade of a snow-plow.

<p><em>"University of Wisconsin-Madison engineers have added a new dimension to our understanding of why straining a particular group of materials, called Ruddlesden-Popper oxides, tampers with their superconducting properties. The findings, published in the journal Nature Communications, could help pave the way toward new advanced electronics. “Strain is one of the knobs we can turn to create materials with desirable properties, so it is important to learn to manipulate its effects,” says Dane Morgan, the Harvey D. Spangler Professor of materials science and engineering at UW-Madison and a senior author on the paper. “These findings might also help explain some puzzling results in strained materials.” Superconducting materials could make the nation’s power grid much more efficient, thanks to their ability to conduct electricity with zero resistance. The substances also enable MRI machines to see inside patients’ bodies and levitate bullet trains above the tracks because of the Meissner effect. “This work is a good example of how basic research can influence developing transformative technologies through systematic understanding of material behaviors by close interaction between theory and experiment,” says Ho Nyung Lee, a distinguished scientist at the Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory who led the research."</em> <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/news/strained-materials-make-cooler-superconductors">[...]</a>

The paper entitled the “Flexo-Photovoltaic Effect” was written by Professor Marin Alexe, Ming-Min Yang, and Dong Jik Kim who are all based in the University of Warwick’s Department of Physics. The Warwick researchers looked at the physical constraints on the current design of most commercial solar cells which place an absolute limit on their efficiency. Most commercial solar cells are formed of two layers creating at their boundary a junction between two kinds of semiconductors, p-type with positive charge carriers (holes which can be filled by electrons) and n-type with negative charge carriers (electrons). When light is absorbed, the junction of the two semiconductors sustains an internal field splitting the photo-excited carriers in opposite directions, generating a current and voltage across the junction. Without such junctions the energy cannot be harvested and the photo-exited carriers will simply quickly recombine eliminating any electrical charge."</em> <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/new_research_could/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://techxplore.com/news/2018-04-mos2-transistor-bendable-oled.html">MoS2 transistor that can be used with bendable OLED displays</a></h2>

<p><em>"A team of researchers from Yonsei University, and Chung-Ang University, both in Korea, has developed a MoS2 transistor that can be used with bendable OLED displays. In their paper published on the open access site Science Advances, the group explains overcoming the problem of resistance between the MoS2 and a transistor's source and drain to create an operational bendable 6x6 pixel array. As phone makers seek ways to separate themselves from their competitors, research continues into the idea of a truly bendable product, which would include a bendable screen. There have been advances, but to date, there is still not a commercially available phone that can be bent like a piece of paper and shoved in a back pocket. In this new effort, the researchers report that they have overcome one of the hurdles involved in bringing a truly bendable phone, television or other screen device to market. One of the serious roadblocks to bendable devices is the resistance that occurs between MoS2 and a transistor's source and drain electrodes—it is just too high for practical use."</em> <a href="https://techxplore.com/news/2018-04-mos2-transistor-bendable-oled.html">[...]</a>

The team of otego makes thermoelectdric generators (TEG) fit for the mass market by using novel materials and large-scale production processes. Production of a prototype series is about to start this year. The “oTEG” innovative energy converter is suited for a large range of applications in the areas of Industry 4.0 and Smart Homes. Similar to solar cells that convert light into electrical energy, TEGs can extract electrical power from the ambient heat and, in this way, ensure continuous supply."</em> <a href="http://www.kit.edu/kit/english/pi_2018_036_microenergy-supply-without-battery-and-cable.php">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Osaka University-led researchers developed technology to combine “a transparent paper” with high transparency (90% of visible-light transmittance of paper made from cellulose nanofibers) and a conventional “white paper” made from cellulose pulp fibers, fabricating a highly transparent electrode and a white electrolyte with high visibility. Through the combination of the electrode and electrolyte, they produced paper-based electrochromic (EC) displays. Their research results were published in ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces. In EC devices, when voltage is applied to a transparent EC electrode, ions or electrons move into the EC layer in the electrolyte (ionic liquid), resulting in coloration or decolzoration. However, conventional EC devices had problems: sealing was necessary for preventing leakage of the electrolyte, making thin films was difficult, and EC performance was compromised due to evaporation of the electrolyte. A group of researchers led by Hirotaka Koga succeeded in preparing a paper electrolyte by supporting a non-volatile electrolyte (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate [bmim]BF4) on the surface of cellulose pulp fibers through hydrogen bonding."</em> <a href="http://resou.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/research/2018/20180417_1">[...]</a>

<p><em>"UCSB researchers use emerging memory devices to develop electronic circuits for cybersecurity applications While we embrace the way the Internet of Things already is making our lives more streamlined and convenient, the cybersecurity risk posed by millions of wirelessly connected gadgets, devices and appliances remains a huge concern. Even single, targeted attacks can result in major damage; when cybercriminals control and manipulate several nodes in a network, the potential for destruction increases. UC Santa Barbara electrical and computer engineering professor Dmitri Strukov is working to address the latter. He and his team are looking to put an extra layer of security on the growing number of internet- and Bluetooth-enabled devices with technology that aims to prevent cloning, the practice by which nodes in a network are replicated and then used to launch attacks from within the network. A chip that deploys ionic memristor technology, it is an analog memory hardware solution to a digital problem. “You can think of it as a black box,” said Strukov, whose new paper, “Hardware-intrinsic security primitives enabled by analogue state and nonlinear conductance variations in integrated memristors,” appears on the cover of Nature Electronics."</em> <a href="http://www.news.ucsb.edu/2018/018940/ionic-black-box">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers have developed an inkjet printing technique that can be used to print optical components such as waveguides. Because the printing approach can also fabricate electronics and microfluidics, it could advance a variety of devices such as optical sensors used for health monitoring and lab-on-a-chip devices that integrate and automate multiple laboratory functions onto a small circuit, or chip. “Inkjet printing is a very attractive method for fabricating optical components because the positions and sizes of features can easily be modified and there is virtually no material waste,” said FabianLütolf, a member of the research team led by Rolando Ferrini at CSEM in Switzerland. “However, the surface tension of the inks makes it difficult to print lines with a specific height, which is necessary to create a waveguide.” Inkjet printing is an additive manufacturing technique that uses tiny nozzles like the ones found in desktop inkjet printers to deposit a computer-generated pattern of drops (the “ink”) onto a substrate to build a structure. The researchers discovered that depositing the ink in two steps, rather than the traditional single step, enabled printing of lines with a specific height and with much smoother features than would otherwise be possible. The printed structures are considered to have 2.5 dimensions because although they are not flat, their complexity is limited compared to structures created with traditional 3D printing."</em> <a href="https://www.osa.org/en-us/about_osa/newsroom/news_releases/2018/researchers_create_precision_optical_components_wi/">[...]</a>

The reversibility of the process opens up new possibilities in the fields of material processing, optical technology, and data storage. Researchers of the HZDR, an independent German research laboratory, studied an alloy of iron and aluminum. It is interesting as a prototype material because subtle changes to its atomic arrangement can completely transform its magnetic behavior. “The alloy possesses a highly ordered structure, with layers of iron atoms that are separated by aluminum atomic layers. When a laser beam destroys this order, the iron atoms are brought closer together and begin to behave like magnets,” says HZDR physicist Rantej Bali."</em> <a href="https://www.helmholtz-berlin.de/pubbin/news_seite?nid=14805;sprache=en;typoid=3228">[...]</a>

The next generation of energy-efficient power electronics, high-frequency communication systems, and solid-state lighting rely on materials known as wide bandgap semiconductors. Circuits based on these materials can operate at much higher power densities and with lower power losses than silicon-based circuits. These materials have enabled a revolution in LED lighting, which led to the 2014 Nobel Prize in physics. In new experiments reported in Applied Physics Letters, from AIP Publishing, researchers have shown that a wide-bandgap semiconductor called gallium oxide (Ga2O3) can be engineered into nanometer-scale structures that allow electrons to move much faster within the crystal structure.

This will lead to the following two issues: Limited network capacity: the hub (router) can be directly connected to 10 devices at most. Limited network coverage: all terminal nodes must be located within the Wi-Fi coverage of the central node, making the networking senario inappropriate for large venues or places with multiple layers."</em> <a href="https://github.com/espressif/esp-mdf">[...]</a>

The primary emphasis of Chibitronics is creating a more friendly way to learn, design and create electronics. Because of this, much of the material relating to paper circuitry on the Internet looks more like art than electronics. This belies the capabilities of paper as an engineering material. Google’s Cardboard and Nintendo’s Labo are mainstream examples of paper’s extraordinary capability as an engineering material.

A servo motor is a closed-loop system that uses position feedback to control its motion and final position. In industrial type servo motors the position feedback sensor is usually a high precision encoder, while in the smaller RC or hobby servos the position sensor is usually a simple potentiometer. The actual position captured by these devices is fed back to the error detector where it is compared to the target position."</em> <a href="https://howtomechatronics.com/how-it-works/how-servo-motors-work-how-to-control-servos-using-arduino/">[...]</a>
