<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1799, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Babbitt">Isaac Babbitt</a>. Este inventor norte-americano foi responsável pela invenção de uma liga (metal de babbitt: estanho 89%, antimónio 7%, cobre 4%.) amplamente utilizada para redução de fricção de rolamentos de babbitt. Em 1924, ele fundou uma empresa que se tornou a Reed &amp; Barton, a mais antiga ourivesaria independente do país. A partir de 1834, foi superintendente da Fundição e Obra Ordinária da Alger (South Boston Iron Works), onde lançou o primeiro canhão de latão fabricado nos EUA. Patenteou a invenção bem sucedida de uma caixa para eixos ferroviários 17 de Julho de 1739, que sugeriu os rolamentos da liga.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1863, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Walden">Paul Walden</a>. Este químico letão, enquanto ensinava em Riga, descobriu a inversão de Walden, uma reversão da configuração estereo-química que ocorre em muitas reacções de compostos covalentes (1896). Devido a essa descoberta, o nome de Walden é mencionado quase em todos os livros didácticos sobre química orgânica publicados em todo o mundo. Walden revelou a auto-racemização e criou as fundações na electroquímica de soluções não aquosas. Walden também é conhecida pela regra de Walden, que relaciona a condutividade e a viscosidade de soluções não aquosas.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1916, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Roy_Whinnery">John R. Whinnery</a>. Este Engenheiro electrotécnico norte-americano ficou conhecido pelo seu trabalho na teoria de microondas e experimentação a laser. Ele trabalhou no problema da modulação a laser He-Ne, a transmissão de luz laser para comunicação óptica e efeitos térmicos fotográficos. Mais tarde, ele mudou o seu campo de pesquisa para electrónica quântica e opto-electrónica. Ele é co-autor do livro didáctico clássico, Fields and Waves in Communication Electronics, antes de ter um doutorado enquanto trabalhava 6 dias por semana em micro-ondas na General Electric durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1925, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Engelberger">Joseph Engelberger</a>. Este Engenheiro norte-americano que, com George Devol, desenvolveu o primeiro robô industrial nos Estados Unidos na década de 1950, o Unimate. Engelberger é muitas vezes referido como o "pai da robótica". Quando ele e o seu sócio fundaram a Unimation em 1956, a empresa foi a primeira grande fabricante de braços robóticos industriais nos EUA. Em 1962, eles instalaram seus primeiros robôs industriais na fabricante de automóveis General Motors.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a conhecer as ambições da Michelin para 2048: os pneus Michelin serão fabricados com 80% de materiais sustentáveis. 100% dos pneus serão reciclados. Hoje, a taxa de recuperação mundial de pneus é de 70% e a taxa de reciclagem é de 50%. Actualmente, os pneus Michelin são fabricados com 28% de materiais sustentáveis (26% de materiais de origem biológica, como borracha natural, óleo de girassol, limoneno etc., e 2% de materiais reciclados, como pneus de aço ou reciclados). Para um futuro sustentável, a Michelin está investindo em tecnologias de reciclagem de alta tecnologia para poder aumentar esse conteúdo para 80% de materiais sustentáveis.</p>

<p>Também esta semana foi anunciado o lançamento do KiCad 5.0. Quase um ano após o lançamento do KiCad 4.0.7, esta nova versão apresenta melhorias em todos os componentes da solução. Destas destacam-se as seguintes: Novas bibliotecas para símbolos e modelos 3D (partes aderem ao KiCad Library Convention (KLC) e são organizadas de maneira diferente das bibliotecas V4); Alterações na biblioteca actualizadas automaticamente na página da biblioteca do site do KiCad; Um novo visualizador em 3D; Nova arquitectura de plug-ins do modelo 3D; Suporte para esquemas de cores arbitrários (GerbView e PcbNew: somente em telas modernas); Novo estilo de destaque para desambiguar selecções para maior clareza; Melhoria do comportamento do zoom ao usar trackpads no MacOS; Algumas melhorias com o suporte a hidpi;  Equações matemáticas simples em alguns campos de entrada; Melhorias significativas nas bibliotecas de símbolos, pegadas e modelos 3D; Mais modelos para plataformas de desenvolvimento comuns, como Arduino e Raspberry Pi; Editor de variáveis de ambiente para gestão de variáveis de ambiente interno; etc.</p>

<p>Nesta sexta-feira que vem, dia 27 de Julho, ocorrerá o eclipse lunar total será a mais longa lua vermelha visível neste século, até 2123. Durante cerca de 50 minutos será possível observar este fenómeno. O eclipse lunar total, que terá uma duração de cerca de uma hora e 45 minutos, será visível a partir da Austrália, Antárctida, Ásia, África, Médio Oriente, Europa, América do Sul, sul do Oceano Pacífico, oceano Índico e oceano Atlântico. América do Norte e Gronelândia são duas regiões desaconselhadas para quem não queira perder o fenómeno. As hipóteses de se avistar a Lua a partir de algum local daquelas duas áreas geográficas são praticamente nulas. Em Portugal e para referencia geográfica, em Faro, a lua vai nascer às 20:38, em Lisboa às 20:47, no Porto às 20:51 em Ponta Delgada às 20:52 e no Funchal às 21:05. Se estiver num destes locais procure uma localização com um horizonte límpido, a nascente, leste, para poder ver a lua a subir no céu. Por definição, o eclipse total da Lua é um fenómeno que ocorre quando a Terra se encontra entre o Sol e a Lua, "de forma a projectar a sua sombra na Lua, e a Lua atravessa completamente a sombra da Terra". O eclipse lunar acontece quando coincidem a fase de Lua cheia e a passagem da Lua pelo seu nodo orbital.</p>

<p>Outra curiosidade espacial é que os astrónomos calcularam que a distância da Terra a Marte será de meros 57,6 milhões de quilómetros na próxima terça-feira, 31 de Julho. Na semana seguinte, na sexta-feira, 11 de Agosto, Marte estará em oposição ao sol. Isso significa que os dois objectos estarão nos lados opostos da Terra. É também quando partes da Ásia, África, Austrália, América do Sul e Europa receberão um eclipse solar parcial. É uma época movimentada do ano para a astronomia.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como um modelo 3D que poderá ser útil. É apresentada a revista MagPI nº72.</p>

<p><em>"Today, the world-wide recovery rate for tires is 70 percent and the recycling rate is 50 percent. Michelin tires are currently made using 28 percent sustainable materials (26 percent bio-sourced materials like natural rubber, sunflower oil, limonene etc., and 2 percent recycled materials such as steel or recycled powdered tires). For a sustainable future, Michelin is investing in high technology recycling technologies to be able to increase this content to 80 percent sustainable materials. Sustainable Materials The route to this ambitious sustainable material target will be achieved by research programs into bio-sourced materials like Biobutterfly and working with Michelin’s high-level partners, and the advanced technologies and materials that are being developed in these partnerships. The Biobutterfly program was launched in 2012 with Axens and IFP Energies Nouvelles to create synthetic elastomers from biomass such as wood, straw or beet. Michelin is developing innovative solutions today in order to integrate more and more recycled and renewable materials in its tires, while continuing to improve performance, including 30% of recycled materials by 2048."</em> <a href="https://www.michelin.com/eng/media-room/press-and-news/press-releases/Group/Michelin-s-2048-ambitions-MICHELIN-tires-will-be-made-using-80-percent-sustainable-materials-100-percent-of-tires-will-be-recycled">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The full moon will turn blood red on July 27 as the longest total lunar eclipse of the century takes place in the skies from Australia through Africa. A total lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes through the Earth’s innermost shadow. When this happens, the moon turns rusty orange or deep red in color and is how it earned the nickname of a blood moon eclipse. The red moon will pair well with Mars, which reaches opposition just before the eclipse and will also appear orange or red in color. Unlike a solar eclipse, no special equipment or glasses are needed to view a total lunar eclipse, although onlookers will require cloud-free weather. Friday’s lunar eclipse will be particularly special as it is the longest total lunar eclipse of the 21st century."</em> <a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/fridays-total-lunar-eclipse-will-be-longest-blood-moon-visible-this-century-until-2123/70005578">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Optical training of neural networks could lead to more efficient artificial intelligence Researchers have shown that it is possible to train artificial neural networks directly on an optical chip. The significant breakthrough demonstrates that an optical circuit can perform a critical function of an electronics-based artificial neural network and could lead to less expensive, faster and more energy efficient ways to perform complex tasks such as speech or image recognition. “Using an optical chip to perform neural network computations more efficiently than is possible with digital computers could allow more complex problems to be solved,” said research team leader Shanhui Fan of Stanford University. “This would enhance the capability of artificial neural networks to perform tasks required for self-driving cars or to formulate an appropriate response to a spoken question, for example. It could also improve our lives in ways we can’t imagine now.” An artificial neural network is a type of artificial intelligence that uses connected units to process information in a manner similar to the way the brain processes information. Using these networks to perform a complex task, for instance voice recognition, requires the critical step of training the algorithms to categorize inputs, such as different words."</em> <a href="https://www.osa.org/en-us/about_osa/newsroom/news_releases/2018/researchers_move_closer_to_completely_optical_arti/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers developed a new computer model that shows how metallic glass behaves under stress to one day build better materials. Metallic glasses -- alloys lacking the crystalline structure normally found in metals -- are an exciting research target for tantalizing applications, including artificial joints and other medical implant devices. However, the difficulties associated with predicting how much energy these materials release when they fracture is slowing down development of metallic glass-based products. Recently, a pair of researchers from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York, developed a new way of simulating to the atomic level how metallic glasses behave as they fracture. This new modeling technique could improve computer-aided materials design and help researchers determine the properties of metallic glasses. The duo reports their findings in the Journal of Applied Physics, from AIP Publishing."</em> <a href="https://publishing.aip.org/publishing/journal-highlights/new-computer-model-predicts-how-fracturing-metallic-glass-releases">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The race to produce safe, powerful and affordable solid-state lithium batteries is accelerating and recent announcements about game-changing research using a solid non-flammable ceramic electrolyte known as garnet has some in the race calling it revolutionary. “This is a paradigm shift in energy storage,” said Kelsey Hatzell, assistant professor of mechanical engineering. A paper – “The Effect of Pore Connectivity on Li Dendrite Propagation Within LLZO Electrolytes Observed with Synchrotron X-ray Tomography” – describing her novel research on the failure points of a garnet electrolyte was published online in March in the American Chemical Society’s Energy Letters, which was among the most read ACS Letters articles that month. Lithium-ion batteries typically contain a liquid organic electrolyte that can catch fire (watch the video). The fire risk is eliminated by the use of a non-flammable garnet-based electrolyte. Replacing liquid electrolytes with a solid organic like garnet also potentially lowers the cost by increasing battery life."</em> <a href="https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/news/2018/safe-solid-state-lithium-batteries-herald-paradigm-shift-in-energy-storage/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"An international team of scientists has discovered a new, exotic form of insulating material with a metallic surface that could enable more efficient electronics or even quantum computing. The researchers developed a new method for analyzing existing chemical compounds that relies on the mathematical properties like symmetry that govern the repeating patterns seen in everyday wallpaper. “The beauty of topology is that one can apply symmetry principles to find and categorize materials,” said B. Andrei Bernevig, a professor of physics at Princeton. The research, appearing July 20 in the journal Science, involved a collaboration among groups from Princeton University, the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), Sungkyunkwan University, Freie Universität Berlin and the Max Planck Institute of Microstructure Physics. The discovery of this form of lead-strontium (Sr2Pb3) completes a decade-long search for an elusive three-dimensional material that combines the unique electronic properties of two-dimensional graphene and three-dimensional topological insulators, a phase of matter discovered in 2005 in independent works by Charles Kane at Penn and Bernevig at Princeton. Some scientists have theorized that topological insulators, which insulate on their interior but conduct electricity on their surface, could serve as a foundation for super-fast quantum computing."</em> <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/news/2018/07/19/physics-treasure-hidden-wallpaper-pattern">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Using an advanced, new microscopy technique that can visualize chemical reactions occurring in liquid environments, researchers have discovered a new reason lithium-oxygen batteries — which promise up to five times more energy than the lithium-ion batteries that power electric vehicles and cell phones — tend to slow down and die after just a few charge/discharge cycles. They report their findings in the journal Nano Energy. “What we were able to see for the first time is that lithium peroxide develops in the liquid electrolyte of lithium-oxygen batteries, and is a contributor to the slow down and ultimate death of these batteries,” said Reza Shahbazian-Yassar, associate professor of mechanical and industrial engineering in the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Engineering and lead author of the paper. “This is a newly discovered reason why these promising batteries have such a steep drop off in efficiency and yield after relatively few charge/discharge cycles.” Lithium-oxygen batteries have been tantalizing to battery researchers for years because of their potential high energy density. But they tend to slow down and stop working relatively quickly compared to other batteries. One of the reasons for this loss of power is that a byproduct of the chemical reactions that take place inside the battery – lithium peroxide — builds up on the electrodes of the battery."</em> <a href="https://today.uic.edu/liquid-microscopy-technique-reveals-new-problem-with-lithium-oxygen-batteries">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A team of international researchers, led by quantum technology experts from the University of Bristol, have shown that a chip-based device can be used to generate quantum-based random numbers at gigabit per second speeds. The tiny device, with a footprint of just a millimetre square, requires little power to operate and could enable stand-alone random number generators and be incorporated into laptops and smartphones to offer real-time encryption. PhD student Francesco Raffaelli from the University of Bristol’s Quantum Engineering Technology Labs (QET Labs), has led the work, which is presented today in The Optical Society of America’s journal Optics Express. He said: “Randomness is needed to secure our communication and storage of information using data encryption. Physicists have known for some time that the nature of quantum mechanics can make randomness that is not easy to copy and impossible to predict.” “We designed and tested a chip made of silicon and works using light to do just this. It integrates all the required optical components on one chip that can be made with industry-standard fabrication — this brings the power of quantum randomness much closer to being integrated into our personal computers and our smartphones.” The researchers use a technique where single particles of light called photons are randomly emitted from a diode laser in such a way that when they enter the silicon chip, a random electrical signal is output, that is impossible to predict."</em> <a href="http://bristol.ac.uk/news/2018/july/silicon-chip-generates-quantum-random-numbers.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Made of electronic circuits coupled to minute particles, the devices could flow through intestines or pipelines to detect problems. Researchers at MIT have created what may be the smallest robots yet that can sense their environment, store data, and even carry out computational tasks. These devices, which are about the size of a human egg cell, consist of tiny electronic circuits made of two-dimensional materials, piggybacking on minuscule particles called colloids. Colloids, which insoluble particles or molecules anywhere from a billionth to a millionth of a meter across, are so small they can stay suspended indefinitely in a liquid or even in air. By coupling these tiny objects to complex circuitry, the researchers hope to lay the groundwork for devices that could be dispersed to carry out diagnostic journeys through anything from the human digestive system to oil and gas pipelines, or perhaps to waft through air to measure compounds inside a chemical processor or refinery. “We wanted to figure out methods to graft complete, intact electronic circuits onto colloidal particles,” explains Michael Strano, the Carbon C.

There is a catch, though: Some information may be lost in the process. “We’ve experimentally confirmed the connection between information in the classical case and the quantum case,” Murch said, “and we’re seeing this new effect of information loss.” The results were published in the July 20 issue of Physical Review Letters.

To make thin-film solar cells, scientists are moving beyond the “classic” semiconductor compounds, such as gallium arsenide or silicon, and working instead with other light-harvesting compounds that have the potential to be cheaper and easier to mass produce. The compounds could be widely adopted if they could perform as well as today’s technology.

<p><em>"How to control several blinds with inexpensive relay boards (not ruining them) with physical buttons and remotely simultaneously. Intro Just bought a new house and wanted to automate everything, starting with the blinds. What seemed to be an easy project turned out to be a bit of a nightmare: the relative high power motors (150 W) were destroying my relays and triacs, what wireless communication and controller to use and how to make it work was not obvious, noise in the lines were causing random activation of the blinds (pretty scary in the middle of the night)... Finally I managed to solve all those issues with very cheap components and hopefully I can help someone else to spare these headaches and a lot of time. Don't like to program, but love to solder? Read anyways the tutorial and at the end you find a discrete circuit, which does the same, but with no intelligence."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/gomecin/blinds-or-any-high-power-motor-control-27f633">[...]</a>
