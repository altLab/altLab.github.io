<p>Faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1736, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles-Augustin_de_Coulomb">Charles-Augustin de Coulomb</a>. Este físico francês ficou conhecido pela formulação da lei de Coulomb, que afirma que a força entre duas cargas eléctricas é proporcional ao produto das cargas e inversamente proporcional ao quadrado da distância entre elas. A força de coulomb é uma das forças principais envolvidas em reacções atómicas. A relação quadrada inversa também é vista na relação da força de gravitação entre as massas. Em 1777, ele inventou uma balança de torção que posteriormente modificou para medições eléctricas. Ele também fez pesquisas sobre o atrito de máquinas, sobre moinhos de vento e sobre a elasticidade das fibras de metal e seda. O Coulomb (símbolo: C) é a unidade de carga eléctrica do Sistema Internacional de Unidades (SI). É a carga (símbolo: Q ou q) transportada por uma corrente constante de um ampere durante um segundo.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1856, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Markov">Andrey Markov</a>. Este matemático russo ajudou a desenvolver a teoria dos processos estocásticos, especialmente aqueles chamados de cadeias de Markov, sequências de variáveis aleatórias em que a variável futura é determinada pela variável presente, mas é independente da maneira em que o estado actual surgiu a partir de seus predecessores. (Por exemplo, a probabilidade de ganhar no jogo do monopólio pode ser determinada usando cadeias de Markov.) O seu trabalho baseado no estudo da probabilidade de eventos mutuamente dependentes foi desenvolvido e amplamente aplicado às ciências biológicas e sociais.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1862, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ulric_Nef_(chemist)">John Ulric Nef</a>. Este químico suíço-americano publicou estudos que demonstraram que o carbono pode ter uma valência (ou seja, afinidade por electrões) de dois (como a quinona), bem como uma valência de quatro, aumentando assim enormemente a compreensão da química orgânica teórica. Ele forneceu uma base para o sistema moderno de notação química. Ele estudou o tautomerismo, especialmente de nitro-parafinas, e descobriu o que hoje é chamado de "reacção de Nef"; a conversão catalisada por ácido de nitroalcanos primários e secundários em aldeídos e cetonas, respectivamente. A sua principal pesquisa foi sobre carbono bivalente, incluindo isonitrilas, monóxido de carbono, fulminatos e metileno. Nos últimos anos, ele estudou as complexas reacções dos açúcares em álcalis e ácido.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1868, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Landsteiner">Karl Landsteiner</a>. Este médico austríaco-americano, imunologista e patologista recebeu o Prémio Nobel da Medicina em 1930 pela descoberta dos principais grupos sanguíneos e pelo desenvolvimento do sistema ABO de tipo sanguínea que reduziu muito o risco e tornou a transfusão sanguínea uma prática médica de rotina. Esta análise do tipo sanguíneo mostrou-se útil também em aplicações genéticas e legais. Ele primeiro relatou que o sangue tinha tipos em 1901. A base desses tipos são proteínas específicas chamadas antígenos que são encontradas na superfície dos glóbulos vermelhos e dos anticorpos encontrados no plasma. Ele também descobriu o factor Rh, que explicou algumas complicações da gravidez e do nascimento, quando o factor Rh da mãe e do bebê não combinam.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1832, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolaus_Otto">Nikolaus August Otto</a>. Este engenheiro alemão desenvolveu com sucesso o motor de combustão interna de carga comprimida que funcionava com gás de petróleo e conduziu ao moderno motor de combustão interna. A VDI (Associação de Engenheiros Alemães) criou o padrão DIN 1940 que diz "Otto Engine: motor de combustão interna no qual a ignição da mistura de ar-combustível comprimido é iniciada por uma centelha", que foi aplicada a todos os motores deste tipo desde então.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a conhecer o Summit - o novo supercomputador mais rápido do mundo. Instalado no Laboratório Nacional de Oak Ridge este computador massivo tem 27,648 Volta Tensor Core GPUs da NVidia que pode disponibilizar cerca de 3 exaops, um valor particularmente elevado de cálculos por segundo. Cerca de 100 vezes mais rápido que o Titan, o anterior supercomputador mais rápido dos EUA, concluído há apenas cinco anos. E 95% desse poder de computação vem das GPUs. Só para colocar as coisas em perspectiva se toda a população terrestre fizesse um calculo por segundo, demoraria 15 anos para fazer o que o Summit faz em apenas 1 segundo. Num teste inicial, uma equipa de genomica resolve um problema numa hora que demoraria 30 anos a resolver num PC actual. O Summit ocupa o espaço de 520 metros quadrados ou cerca de dois campos de ténis e pesa o equivalente a um avião comercial.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. É apresentada a revista newelectronics de 12 de Junho.</p>

<p><em>"Starship Technologies, a robotics startup created by Skype’s cofounders, has launched a large-scale commercial autonomous delivery service aimed at corporate and academic campuses in Europe and the U.S. Founded out of Estonia, Starship Technologies has initiated myriad autonomous delivery trials over the past few years, covering food and other small packages, in more than 100 cities. Though the robots are autonomous, they can also be monitored and controlled remotely by humans if the situation requires it. The company was created by Skype’s Ahti Heinla and Janus Friis in 2014, and it has raised around $17 million in venture capital funding. The latest program could become one of the largest autonomous delivery services globally, with little armies of robots deployed across campus in a range of situations, including delivering food or transferring goods. The company said it plans to launch around 1,000 robots by the end of this year on a number of as-yet-undisclosed campuses."</em> <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/04/30/starship-technologies-launches-autonomous-robot-delivery-services-for-campuses/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Intel researchers are taking new steps toward quantum computers by testing a tiny new “spin qubit” chip. The new chip was created in Intel’s D1D Fab in Oregon using the same silicon manufacturing techniques that the company has perfected for creating billions of traditional computer chips. Smaller than a pencil’s eraser, it is the tiniest quantum computing chip Intel has made. The new spin qubit chip runs at the extremely low temperatures required for quantum computing: roughly 460 degrees below zero Fahrenheit – 250 times colder than space. The spin qubit chip does not contain transistors – the on/off switches that form the basis of today’s computing devices – but qubits (short for “quantum bits”) that can hold a single electron. The behavior of that single electron, which can be in multiple spin states simultaneously, offers vastly greater computing power than today’s transistors, and is the basis of quantum computing."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news/intel-starts-testing-smallest-spin-qubit-chip-quantum-computing/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://news.yale.edu/2018/06/07/new-laser-makes-silicon-sing">New laser makes silicon 'sing'</a></h2>

<p><em>"Yale scientists have created a new type of silicon laser that uses sound waves to amplify light. A study about the discovery appears in the online edition of the journal Science. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in translating optical technologies — such as fiber optics and free-space lasers — into tiny optical or “photonic” integrated circuits. Using light rather than electricity for integrated circuits permits sending and processing information at speeds that would be impossible with conventional electronics. Researchers say silicon photonics — optical circuits based on silicon chips — are one of the leading platforms for such technologies, thanks to their compatibility with existing microelectronics. “We’ve seen an explosion of growth in silicon photonic technologies the past few of years,” said Peter Rakich, an associate professor of applied physics at Yale who led the research."</em> <a href="https://news.yale.edu/2018/06/07/new-laser-makes-silicon-sing">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Rice University, Los Alamos lead project to study excitons important to next-generation electronics Scientists led by Rice University and Los Alamos National Laboratory have discovered electronic properties in quantum-scale devices that are likely to impact the growing field of low-cost perovskite based optoelectronics. In an open-access Nature Communications paper, researchers led by Los Alamos scientists Aditya Mohite and Jean-Christophe Blancon, both of whom will join Rice this summer, studied the behavior of excitons trapped in quantum wells made of crystalline, halide-based perovskite compounds. As a result, they were able to create a scale by which labs can determine the binding energy of excitons, and thus the band gap structures, in perovskite quantum wells of any thickness. This could in turn aid in the fundamental design of next-generation semiconductor materials. Perovskite quantum well-based optoelectronic devices convert and control light at the quantum scale, reactions below 100 nanometers that follow different rules from those dictated by classical mechanics. Solar cells that turn light into electricity are optoelectronic devices."</em> <a href="http://news.rice.edu/2018/06/08/scientists-go-deep-to-quantify-perovskite-properties-2/">[...]</a>

By demonstrating a new type of laser that amplifies light with sound waves in a silicon chip, the team’s research represents a significant advance in the field of silicon photonics. Behunin contributed to the theory and modeling aspects of the project, the results of which were published Thursday in Science. Replacing wires with “waveguides” a potential game-changer for technology Having the ability to manipulate light in silicon could potentially represent a game-changer in computer chip technology. “We’ve invested trillions of dollars in understanding silicon, because that’s the material we use to create computer chips,” Behunin said. “We can control silicon at the atomic level, make wafers of pure crystal silicon and even make a silicon crystal out of atoms that all have the same atomic weight."</em> <a href="http://news.nau.edu/behunin-brillouin-laser/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Extremely short mid-infrared laser pulses will help scientists explore ultrafast processes in atoms A laser synthesizer developed by an A*STAR researcher and his overseas collaborators produces infrared pulses shorter than the wave period, which could enable scientists to probe how electrons move inside atoms and solids. Importantly, these pulses are readily absorbed by many atoms and molecules because their wavelengths lie in the mid-infrared range. Processes within atoms, such as electrons moving from one energy level to another, happen extremely quickly, on time scales of femtoseconds (10−15 second) or even attoseconds (10−18 second). Consequently, researchers need very short, high-power laser pulses to observe these events. One way to generate them is to shine highly intense, ultrashort infrared pulses on to nonlinear crystals. Houkun Liang at A*STAR’s Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology and his colleagues in the United States and Germany realized they needed to rethink conventional approaches for generating ultrashort mid-infrared pulses."</em> <a href="https://research.a-star.edu.sg/research/7854/new-approach-to-generating-ultrashort-pulses">[...]</a>

<p><em>"New evolutionary indicator helps uncover ancient transcription systems Researchers at the University of Tokyo and their collaborators have revealed for the first time the mechanism by which the system that initiates transcription in eukaryotes gained complexity when organisms in this domain evolved from archaea about 2.5 billion years ago. In studying evolution, scientists generally use fossils to estimate when organisms diverged from their common ancestors. In the field of molecular evolution, researchers look at identical or closely related sequences in DNA and proteins of existing organisms to trace their evolutionary history by applying such methods known as sequence comparison, measurement of evolutionary distance, and phylogenetic analysis. However, these methods have inherent drawbacks: Because genes of ancient organisms can no longer be found, we cannot measure the evolutionary distances, or changes in the genes, between existing organisms and their ancestors. Therefore, the evolutionary process of the whole gene family has never been determined. In a previous study published in 2016, the research group led by Associate Professor Masami Horikoshi of the Institute for Quantitative Biosciences at the University of Tokyo developed a new analytical method for measuring the evolutionary distances between existing and ancestral organisms by focusing on sequences that repeat themselves within a gene."</em> <a href="https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/utokyo-research/research-news/scientists-reveal-how-eukaryotic-transcription-systems-gained-complexity.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Wireless smart-home system from the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory could monitor diseases and help the elderly “age in place.” X-ray vision has long seemed like a far-fetched sci-fi fantasy, but over the last decade a team led by Professor Dina Katabi from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) has continually gotten us closer to seeing through walls. Their latest project, “RF-Pose,” uses artificial intelligence (AI) to teach wireless devices to sense people’s postures and movement, even from the other side of a wall. The researchers use a neural network to analyze radio signals that bounce off people’s bodies, and can then create a dynamic stick figure that walks, stops, sits, and moves its limbs as the person performs those actions. The team says that RF-Pose could be used to monitor diseases like Parkinson’s, multiple sclerosis (MS), and muscular dystrophy, providing a better understanding of disease progression and allowing doctors to adjust medications accordingly. It could also help elderly people live more independently, while providing the added security of monitoring for falls, injuries and changes in activity patterns. The team is currently working with doctors to explore RF-Pose’s applications in health care."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2018/artificial-intelligence-senses-people-through-walls-0612">[...]</a>

<p><em>"An experimental campaign conducted at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s (LLNL) National Ignition Facility (NIF) has achieved a total fusion neutron yield of 1.9e16 (1.9x1016) and 54 KJ of fusion energy output -- double the previous record. Researchers in LLNL’s Inertial Confinement Fusion Program (ICF) detail the results in a paper that will be published this week in Physical Review Letters. NIF is the world’s largest and most energetic laser, designed to perform experimental studies of fusion ignition and thermonuclear burn, the phenomenon that powers the sun, stars and modern nuclear weapons. As a key component of the National Nuclear Security Administration’s Stockpile Stewardship Program, experiments fielded on NIF enable researchers to gain fundamental understanding of extreme temperatures, pressures and densities -- knowledge that helps ensure the current and future nuclear stockpile is safe and reliable. The record-breaking experiments utilized a diamond capsule -- a layer of ultra-thin high-density carbon containing the deuterium-tritium (DT) fusion fuel -- seated inside a depleted uranium hohlraum. This approach allowed the researchers to greatly improve their control over the symmetry of the X-rays that drive the capsule, producing “rounder” and more symmetric implosions."</em> <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/news/nif-achieves-record-double-fusion-yield">[...]</a>

In terms of cost, stability and efficiency (20-22% for a typical solar cell on the market), they are well ahead of the competition. However, after decades of research and investment, silicon-based solar cells are now close to their maximum theoretical efficiency. As a result, new concepts are required to achieve a long-term reduction in solar electricity prices and allow photovoltaic technology to become a more widely adopted way of generating power. One solution is to place two different types of solar cells on top of each other to maximize the conversion of light rays into electrical power.

<p><em>"Army scientists proved a decades-old prediction that mixing TNT and novel aluminum nanoparticles can significantly enhance energetic performance. This explosive discovery is expected to extend the reach of U.S. Army firepower in battle. Researchers from the U.S. Army Research Laboratory and Texas Tech University demonstrated up to 30-percent enhancement in the detonation velocity of the explosive TNT by adding novel aluminum nanoparticles in which the native alumina shell has been replaced with an oxidizing salt called AIH, or aluminum iodate hexahydrate. The structure of the AIH-coated aluminum nanoparticles was revealed for the very first time through high resolution transmission electron (TEM) microscopy performed by ARL's Dr. Chi-Chin Wu, a materials researcher who leads the plasma research for the lab's Energetic Materials Science Branch in the Lethality Division of Weapons and Materials Research Directorate. Wu said this revolutionary research offers the potential for the exploitation of aluminum and potentially other metallic nanoparticles in explosive formulations to extend the range and destructive power of Army weapons systems, a key objective of the Army's "Long Range Precision Fires" modernization priority. "We believe these results show tremendous promise for enhancing the detonation performance of conventional military explosives with aluminum nanoparticles for the first time," said ARL's Dr. Jennifer Gottfried, a physical chemist who collaborated on the research."</em> <a href="https://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?article=3239">[...]</a>

The software and hardware needed to co-ordinate a team of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that can communicate and work toward a common goal have recently been developed by KAUST researchers. “Giving UAVs more autonomy makes them an even more valuable resource,” says Mohamed Abdelkader, who worked on the project with his colleagues under the guidance of Jeff Shamma. “Monitoring the progress of a drone sent out on a specific task is far easier than remote-piloting one yourself. A team of drones that can communicate among themselves provides a tool that could be used widely, for example, to improve security or capture images simultaneously over a large area.” The researchers trialed a capture the flag game scenario, whereby a team of defender drones worked together within a defined area to intercept an intruder drone and prevent it from reaching a specific place. To give the game more authenticity, and to check if their algorithms would work under unpredictable conditions, the intruder drone was remote-piloted by a researcher."</em> <a href="https://discovery.kaust.edu.sa/en/article/510/robots-learn-by-checking-in-on-team%250amembers">[...]</a>

In some countries exposed to consistent electrical atmospheric phenomena in their risks, this becomes particularly important. Without making any reference to the word of cinema, where catastrophic movies with “killer” lightnings are not lacking, we can understand how lightnings we see crossing the sky and hitting the ground could be dangerous, due to the huge amount of energy they can transmit eet coming from the sky (where they are formed) and crashing to the ground, on buildings, trees and unfortunately even on humans.
