<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1790, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Stirling">Robert Stirling</a>. Este inventor escocês ficou conhecido pela invenção do motor de ciclo Stirling. Os seus princípios foram incluídos na sua primeira patente britânica, No. 4081 (1816), a que ele chamou de economizador de calor, enquanto descrevia métodos de regenerar o calor do escapamento de volta para os gases de entrada. Ele continuou a refinar sua ideia durante anos na sua oficina doméstica ao longo do seu tempo livre. O primeiro motor prático de Stirling gerou cerca de 2 cavalos de potência, passando dois anos bombeando água para fora de uma pedreira. Em 1843, ele tinha um motor a vapor modificado que produzia 37 cavalos de potência. Ele foi ajudado na preparação de novas patentes por seu irmão James, um engenheiro mecânico que geria uma fundição onde o motor era fabricado. Robert também fez instrumentos científicos.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1910, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Higinbotham">William Higinbotham</a>. Este Físico norte-americano ficou conhecido por ter inventado o primeiro videojogo, Tennis for Two, como entretenimento para o dia de visitantes de 1958 no Brookhaven National Laboratory. Ele usava um pequeno computador analógico com dez amplificadores operacionais ligados diretamente e mostrava uma visão lateral do vôo curvo da bola de ténis num osciloscópio de apenas cinco polegadas de diâmetro. Cada jogador tinha um botão de controle e um botão. No final da Segunda Guerra Mundial, ele tornou-se líder do grupo de eletrónica em Los Alamos, Novo México, onde a bomba nuclear foi desenvolvida.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1928, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Naur">Peter Naur</a>. Este dinamarquês é um pioneiro da ciência da computação e vencedor do prémio Turing. Seu sobrenome é o "N" na notação BNF (forma Backus – Naur), usado na descrição da sintaxe para a maioria das linguagens de programação. Ele contribuiu para a criação da linguagem de programação ALGOL 60. As suas principais áreas de pesquisa foram design, estrutura e desempenho de programas de computador e algoritmos. Áreas como engenharia de software e arquitetura de software também foram pioneiras na Naur. No seu livro Computing: A Human Activity (1992), que é uma coleção das suas contribuições para a ciência da computação, ele rejeitou a escola formalista de programação que vê a programação como um ramo da matemática. Ele não gostava de estar associado com a forma Backus-Naur (atribuída a ele por Donald Knuth) e disse que preferiria que ela fosse chamado de forma normal de Backus.</p>

<p>Esta semana ficámos a saber que a sonda Curiosity está parcialmente operacional e já envia imagens tiradas com as câmaras do lado A. Estas não eram usadas desde 2013. As operações cientificas voltaram a puder ser feitas ainda que limitadas até que a equipa possa resolver a anomalia de que a sonda padece na sua memória.</p>

<p>Também esta semana a NASA deu grandes passos para colocar em funcionamento um giroscópio de backup do telescópio espacial Hubble que estava incorrectamente retornando taxas de rotação extremamente altas. O giroscópio de backup foi ligado depois do telescópio ter entrado em modo de segurança devido a uma rotação com falha na sexta-feira, 5 de Outubro. As taxas de rotação produzidas pelo giroscópio de backup foram reduzidas e agora estão dentro de um intervalo esperado. Testes adicionais serão realizados para garantir que o Hubble possa retornar às operações científicas com este giroscópio.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. É apresentada a revista MagPI Nº75 de Novembro.</p>

<p><em>"Contrary to the "frightening" title, the Curiosity team is excited that science operations are starting to resume! The real fright was when Curiosity had an anomaly on Sol 2172 which affected its memory. Since then, the engineering team has continued to diagnose the anomaly and plan the recovery, including taking the first images with the A-side engineering cameras that haven't been used since 2013! Thanks to our hard-working engineers, Curiosity is ready for limited science operations while the anomaly work continues. Curiosity has been at the (sadly) unsuccessful "Inverness" drill site since the anomaly.

<p><em>"NASA took great strides last week to press into service a Hubble Space Telescope backup gyroscope (gyro) that was incorrectly returning extremely high rotation rates. The backup gyro was turned on after the spacecraft entered safe mode due to a failed gyro on Friday, Oct. 5. The rotation rates produced by the backup gyro have since reduced and are now within an expected range. Additional tests will be performed to ensure Hubble can return to science operations with this gyro. A gyro is a device that measures the speed at which the spacecraft is turning, and is needed to help Hubble turn and lock on to new targets. A wheel inside the gyro spins at a constant rate of 19,200 revolutions per minute."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2018/update-on-the-hubble-space-telescope-safe-mode">[...]</a>

<p><em>"What happens when a new technology is so precise that it operates on a scale beyond our characterization capabilities? For example, the lasers used at INRS produce ultrashort pulses in the femtosecond range (10–15 s) that are far too short to visualize. Although some measurements are possible, nothing beats a clear image, says INRS professor and ultrafast imaging specialist Jinyang Liang. He and his colleagues, led by Caltech’s Lihong Wang, have developed what they call T-CUP: the world’s fastest camera, capable of capturing ten trillion (1013) frames per second (Fig. 1). This new camera literally makes it possible to freeze time to see phenomena—and even light!—in extremely slow motion."</em> <a href="http://www.inrs.ca/english/actualites/worlds-fastest-camera-freezes-time-10-trillion-frames-second">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.microchip.com/en/pressreleasepage/extend-battery-life-with-ultra-low-iq-ldo">Extend Battery Life in Portable Devices with New Ultra-low Iq LDO</a></h2>

<p><em>"Device prolongs battery life up to four times longer than traditional ultra-low Iq LDOs Portable electronic devices are now expected to run for months or even years on a single battery, making minimizing power consumption in these applications a top priority for product designers. Microchip Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP) today introduced a linear Low Dropout (LDO) regulator that extends battery life in portable devices up to four times longer than traditional ultra-low quiescent (Iq) LDOs. With an ultra-low Iq of 250 nanoamps (nA) versus the approximately 1 uA operation of traditional devices, the MCP1811 LDO reduces quiescent current to save battery life, enabling end users to recharge or replace batteries less often. Ideal for IoT and battery-operated applications such as wearables, remotes and hearing aids, the 250 nA ultra-low Iq reduces power consumption in applications by minimizing standby or shutdown current. Reducing standby power consumption is critical in remote, battery-powered sensor nodes, where battery replacement is difficult and operating life requirements are high. Available in package options as small as 1 x 1 millimeter (mm), the MCP1811 consumes minimal board space to meet the needs of today’s compact portable electronic designs."</em> <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en/pressreleasepage/extend-battery-life-with-ultra-low-iq-ldo">[...]</a>

<p><em>"NASA's MarCO mission was designed to find out if briefcase-sized spacecraft called CubeSats could survive the journey to deep space. Now, MarCO - which stands for Mars Cube One - has Mars in sight. One of the twin MarCO CubeSats snapped this image of Mars on Oct. 3 - the first image of the Red Planet ever produced by this class of tiny, low-cost spacecraft. The two CubeSats are officially called MarCO-A and MarCO-B but nicknamed "EVE" and "Wall-E" by their engineering team. A wide-angle camera on top of MarCO-B produced the image as a test of exposure settings. The MarCO mission, led by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, hopes to produce more images as the CubeSats approach Mars ahead of Nov. 26."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7263">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Massive structures of moving air that appear like waves in Jupiter's atmosphere were first detected by NASA's Voyager missions during their flybys of the gas-giant world in 1979. The JunoCam camera aboard NASA's Juno mission to Jupiter has also imaged the atmosphere. JunoCam data has detected atmospheric wave trains, towering atmospheric structures that trail one after the other as they roam the planet, with most concentrated near Jupiter's equator. The JunoCam imager has resolved smaller distances between individual wave crests in these trains than ever seen before. This research provides valuable information on both the dynamics of Jupiter's atmosphere and its structure in the regions underneath the waves. "JunoCam has counted more distinct wave trains than any other spacecraft mission since Voyager," said Glenn Orton, a Juno scientist from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7264">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Chinese scientists plan to build the world's most powerful electron collider by 2030, a project that will cost 35 billion yuan ($5.05 billion), the project's leading scientist told the Global Times on Monday. The location of the project has yet to be decided, Wang Yifang, director of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of High Energy Physics in Beijing, told the Global Times on Monday. "The collider will have a circumference of 100 kilometers, with a center-mass energy up to 240 giga electron-volts both setting a world record," Wang said. The collider should produce more Higgs boson particles, the essential, inevitable quarry of modern particle physics, He noted. The conceptual design for the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) passed international examinations in September, Wang said. The collider will provide light at a million electron-volt power level, creating the most advanced conditions for research on new materials and nuclear physics, Wang explained."</em> <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1124030.shtml">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Before I got into the accessibility field, I worked as an art therapist where I met people from all walks of life. No matter the reason why they came to therapy, almost everyone I met seemed to benefit from engaging in the creative process. Art gives us the ability to point beyond spoken or written language, to unite us, delight, and satisfy. Done right, this process can be enhanced by technology—extending our ability and potential for play. One of my first sessions as a therapist was with a middle school student on the autism spectrum. He had trouble communicating and socializing with his peers, but in our sessions together he drew, made elaborate scenes with clay, and made music."</em> <a href="https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/accessibility/making-creative-tools-more-accessible-everyone/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Raises productivity in wide range of applications, including part manufacturing and build-up repair Mitsubishi Electric Corporation announced today that it has developed a unique dot forming technology that realizes high-precision shaping by combining laser, computer numerical control (CNC) and computer aided manufacturing CAM technologies in 3D printers. The technology produces high-quality three-dimensional (3D) parts with few voids at high speed, employing a laser wire directed-energy deposition (DED) method, which is an additive-manufacturing process that uses focused thermal energy to fuse materials as they are deposited. Mitsubishi Electric believes that its new technology will raise productivity in a wide range of applications, such as the "near-net" (near-final) shaping of aircraft and automobile parts and build-up repairs. A three-dimensional metal shaping machine incorporating the new technology will be exhibited for reference at the 29th Japan International Machine Tool Fair (JIMTOF2018), which will be held at the Tokyo Big Sight exhibition complex beginning November 1. Mitsubishi Electric expects to launch a commercial version within the fiscal year ending in March 2021. 1)  High-quality 3D parts formed at high speed -    High-quality 3D parts with few voids can be formed at high speed using the laser wire DED method, which supplies metal wire directly to the laser-irradiated part for build-up shaping."</em> <a href="http://www.mitsubishielectric.com/news/2018/1023.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Hyundai Motor Group has ventured further into the high-value robotics industry of the future by commencing development of Hyundai Vest Exoskeleton (H-VEX) wearable industrial robots. Following the Hyundai Chairless Exoskeleton (H-CEX) demonstration conducted in the Hyundai-KIA North American factory last August, the company plans to verify H-VEX’s success through extensive testing at the end of 2018. In early 2018, Hyundai selected Robot-Artificial Intelligence as one of five areas of future innovation growth.

Protein nanowires have many advantages over the silicon nanowires and carbon nanotubes in terms of their biocompatibility, stability, and potential to be modified to sense a wide range of biomolecules and chemicals of medical or environmental interest, says Lovley.

<p><em>"With the rapid development of advanced technologies in electronics industry, the demand for portable electronics, shaped display devices and wearable electronic textiles is ever increasing. Flexible solar cells are thereby receiving more and more attention for their favorable traits including flexibility, light weight, portability and compatiblity with curved surfaces. Mass production of flexible solar cells can be achieved by continuous roll-to-roll technology. Therefore, research on flexible perovskite solar cells has been accelerated, and the research field mainly focuses on how to improve efficiency, increase active area, reduce cost, make low-temperature preparation, and realize mass production. A research group led by Prof. LIU Shengzhong from the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics (DICP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences achieved a series of innovations in perovskite solar cells, and repetitiously created an efficiency of world record for flexible, rigid planar-type and two-dimensional perovskite solar cells. Recently, LIU's group, in collaboration with Prof. YANG Dong’s group from Shaanxi Normal University, published a review article on providing a comprehensive summary of the prior art with perspective discussion on application cost, potential opportunities and challenges in flexible perovskite solar cells."</em> <a href="http://english.cas.cn/newsroom/research_news/201810/t20181024_200421.shtml">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Neural models could improve understanding of neurodegenerative and other diseases, and facilitate discovery of treatments A team of Tufts University-led researchers has developed three-dimensional (3D) human tissue culture models for the central nervous system that mimic structural and functional features of the brain and demonstrate neural activity sustained over a period of many months. With the ability to populate a 3D matrix of silk protein and collagen with cells from patients with Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and other conditions, the tissue models allow for the exploration of cell interactions, disease progression and response to treatment. The development and characterization of the models are reported today in ACS Biomaterials Science &amp; Engineering, a journal of the American Chemical Society. The new 3D brain tissue models overcome a key challenge of previous models –the availability of human source neurons. This is due to the fact that neurological tissues are rarely removed from healthy patients and are usually only available post-mortem from diseased patients. The 3D tissue models are instead populated with human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that can be derived from many sources, including patient skin."</em> <a href="https://now.tufts.edu/news-releases/tufts-scientists-grow-functioning-human-neural-networks-3d-stem-cells">[...]</a>

Here's how: The Cardboard Inchworm can sense a loud sound using the audio sensor (microphone) built into the CPX. Then it can think about how to react, thanks to the CPX's powerful microcontroller brain. Finally, it can act by triggering the servo motor to repeatedly pull the front and back of the Inchworm together and letting them slide apart, creating a slow but steady crawling motion. The Inchworm is quick to build, and Microsoft MakeCode makes it super-easy to program!"</em> <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/Cardboard-Robot-Inchworm?view=all">[...]</a>
