<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1825, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Erlenmeyer">Emil Erlenmeyer</a>. Este químico alemão ficou conhecido por contribuir para o desenvolvimento inicial da teoria da estrutura, formulando a regra de Erlenmeyer e projectar o Erlenmeyer, um tipo de frasco químico, que tem o seu nome.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1875, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Lebesgue">Henri Lebesgue</a>. Este Matemático francês desenvolveu uma teoria da integração, agora conhecida pelo seu nome. Ao estender o trabalho de Camille Jordan e Émile Borel no integral de Riemann, Lebesgue forneceu uma generalização que resolveu muitas das dificuldades em usar a teoria da integração de Riemann. Lebesque forneceu uma base para o desenvolvimento subsequente da teoria da integração e sua posterior aplicação no cálculo, na rectificação de curvas e na teoria da teoria trigonométrica. Ele também contribuiu noutros campos da matemática, incluindo teoria dos conjuntos, cálculos de variação e teoria das funções.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1926, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Ledley">Robert Ledley</a>. Este físico e radiologista norte-americano inventou o scanner de diagnóstico de raios X - ACTA (Automatic Computerized Transverse Axial), a primeira máquina de tomografia computorizada (TC) de corpo inteiro que revolucionou o diagnóstico médico. O ACTA pode fazer uma análise tridimensional de todos os órgãos e partes do corpo numa série de imagens de secção transversal usando raios X finos e processamento de computador de alta potência dos dados recolhidos. Usando o ACTA, o diagnóstico de tumores é possível, mesmo dentro de grandes órgãos, e pode melhorar a radioterapia para o cancro.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1936, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_O._Chua">Leon O. Chua</a>. Este engenheiro electrotécnico norte-americano contribuiu para a teoria de circuitos não-lineares e a teoria da rede neural celular (CNN). Ele também é o inventor e homónimo do circuito de Chua, um dos primeiros e mais conhecidos circuitos a exibir um comportamento caótico, e foi o primeiro a conceber as teorias por detrás e postular a existência do memristor. Trinta e sete anos depois dele ter previsto a sua existência, um memristor de estado sólido foi criado por uma equipa liderada por R. Stanley Williams na Hewlett Packard.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou a Boeing apresentou o novo conceito de avião hipersónico para passageiros. Este irá possibilitar viagens intercontinentais de cerca de 2 horas. O conceito, juntamente com outras visões do futuro da Boeing, estarão em exibição na feira Farnborough Air em Julho.</p>

<p>Ainda esta semana foi finalmente anunciado o WPA3. A Wi-Fi Alliance finalmente introduziu este novo protocolo que irá ser a próxima geração de segurança Wi-Fi®, trazendo novos recursos para melhorar as protecções Wi-Fi em redes pessoais e corporativas. Com base na ampla adopção do WPA2 em mais de uma década, o WPA3 adiciona novos recursos para simplificar a segurança Wi-Fi, permitir autenticação mais robusta e fornecer maior força criptográfica para utilizadores de dados altamente confidenciais.</p>

<p>Finalmente ficámos também saber que o projecto Aquila do Facebook foi descontinuado. O projecto Aquila realizou dois voos de teste públicos de alto perfil de um drone protótipo, o primeiro dos quais em 2016 resultou em sérios danos à aeronave durante a aterragem. Agora, em vez de construir sua própria aeronave, o Facebook diz que agora se concentrará em trabalhar com parceiros em sistemas de entrega de Internet em alta altitude e em questões políticas relacionadas à garantia de espectro e ao estabelecimento de regras federais em torno da operação de tais sistemas.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. É apresentada a revista MagPI Nº71 assim como as revistas newelectronics de 25 e 26 de Junho.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.boeing.com/features/2018/06/hypersonic-concept-vehicle.page">Early Look: This aircraft concept shows a hypersonic vehicle for passengers</a></h2>

<p><em>"Building the future at Boeing requires looking decades ahead at what could be possible, and innovating now to make it happen. That’s the impetus behind Boeing’s first passenger-carrying hypersonic concept that was debuted at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics conference in Atlanta this week. The passenger concept could have military or commercial applications; this is just one of several hypersonic vehicle concepts spanning a wide range of potential applications company engineers are studying. Engineers are working companywide to develop enabling technology will position the company for the time when customers and markets are ready to reap the benefits of hypersonic flight. “We’re excited about the potential of hypersonic technology to connect the world faster than ever before,” said Kevin Bowcutt, senior technical fellow and chief scientist of hypersonics. “Boeing is building upon a foundation of six decades of work designing, developing and flying experimental hypersonic vehicles, which makes us the right company to lead the effort in bringing this technology to market in the future.” Although Bowcutt can’t speculate when hypersonic flight for global travel will be a reality, he says it’s possible a hypersonic passenger vehicle could be airborne in 20 to 30 years."</em> <a href="https://www.boeing.com/features/2018/06/hypersonic-concept-vehicle.page">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Next-generation Wi-Fi® security for personal and enterprise networks Wi-Fi Alliance® introduces Wi-Fi CERTIFIED WPA3™, the next generation of Wi-Fi® security, bringing new capabilities to enhance Wi-Fi protections in personal and enterprise networks. Building on the widespread adoption of WPA2™ over more than a decade, WPA3™ adds new features to simplify Wi-Fi security, enable more robust authentication, and deliver increased cryptographic strength for highly sensitive data markets. As the Wi-Fi industry transitions to WPA3 security, WPA2 devices will continue to interoperate and provide recognized security. WPA3 security continues to support the market through two distinct modes of operation: WPA3-Personal and WPA3-Enterprise. All WPA3 networks use the latest security methods, disallow outdated legacy protocols, and require use of Protected Management Frames (PMF) to maintain resiliency of mission critical networks. Key capabilities of WPA3 include: WPA3-Personal: more resilient, password-based authentication even when users choose passwords that fall short of typical complexity recommendations."</em> <a href="https://www.wi-fi.org/news-events/newsroom/wi-fi-alliance-introduces-wi-fi-certified-wpa3-security">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Today nearly 4 billion people globally do not have access to the Internet. It’s why Facebook, along with many other companies and governments, is investing heavily to address the three key barriers to getting everyone, everywhere online: availability, affordability, and awareness. Part of that investment has been in developing next-generation connectivity technologies like Aquila, a high altitude platform station (HAPS) system. This has involved a lot of trial and error. When we started the Aquila program back in 2014, very few companies were involved in this area — and they were all working independently of one other. In addition, the only spectrum available for these platforms wasn’t suitable for broadband due to technical and geographical limitations."</em> <a href="https://code.fb.com/connectivity/high-altitude-connectivity-the-next-chapter/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"DEWA will work with Microsoft and access new quantum Microsoft Azure services to create quantum-inspired solutions to power energy optimization and improve sustainability efforts in Dubai and the United Arab Emirates The Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) on Thursday announced plans to work with Microsoft Corp. to develop new quantum-based solutions to address energy optimization and other challenges where classical computers have serious limitations, making it the first organization outside the U.S. to participate in the Microsoft Quantum program. As part of the deal, Microsoft will work closely with DEWA to identify the challenges where quantum computing will have the greatest impact. Energy optimization, for example, requires far too much traditional computing power to identify the ideal balance of resources from different energy sources to meet ever-changing consumption needs in real time. As part of Dubai 10X (an initiative to use advances in technology to deliver new or existing services in radically different ways), DEWA wants to reimagine its role as a utility company by launching “Digital DEWA,” the digital arm of Dubai Electricity and Water Authority, and is leveraging Microsoft Quantum to help accelerate its goals. In addition, the two organizations will look at ways to support the Dubai EXPO 2020, an event that brings people from all over the world to share ideas. “We are delighted to work with Microsoft to bring the revolutionary power of quantum computing to Dubai, to achieve the vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, vice president and prime minister of the UAE and ruler of Dubai, to make Dubai the smartest and happiest city in the world."</em> <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2018/06/28/microsoft-and-dewa-bringing-quantum-computing-to-dubai/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"As part of ongoing acoustic research at Binghamton University, Distinguished Professor Ron Miles has created a workable sensor with the least possible resistance to motion. The thin and flexible sensor is ideal for sensing sounds because it can move with the airflow made by even the softest noises and addresses issues with accelerometers, microphones and many other similar sensors. “The goal was to create a sensor that only resists gravity,” explained Miles. “The sensor needed to stay connected to the device but other than that, I wanted it to move with even the slightest sounds or movement of the air.” Being able to move with the air is how sensors are able to tell when a sound is present and which direction it is coming from. Miles made headway with acoustic sensors in 2017 by using spider silk dipped in gold as a thin, flexible sensor to make a microphone with remarkably flat frequency response. This sensor incorporated a magnet in order to convert the silk motion into an electronic signal."</em> <a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/news/story/1196/engineer-creates-new-design-for-ultra-thin-capacitive-sensors/">[...]</a>

Made by infusing a magnetic fluid in a solid microtexture, the researchers demonstrated how the surface could be used to direct the movement and assembly of micro-scale particles, regulate the flow and mixing of millimeter-size droplets, or turn adhesive properties on and off at the macroscale. “Multifunctional materials capable of performing various tasks is a new, promising area of research,” said Joanna Aizenberg, the Amy Smith Berylson Professor of Materials Science and Professor of Chemistry &amp; Chemical Biology at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and senior author of the paper. “The demonstrated applications – new forms of reversible, hierarchical particle self-assembly, manipulation and transport of non-magnetic matter in a magnetic field by topography-induced hydrodynamic forces, precisely timed chemical reactions, and rewritable, spatial addressing of directional adhesion, friction, and biofilm removal – are only a small representative sample of ample possibilities this new concept opens up to the imagination.” Aizenberg is also Core Member of the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University.

Anchored in the world of self-structuring polyhedra, noMad is based on principles of synergetics, the study of geometry in transformation and the impact of a local change on its global systems behaviour: a single unit can autonomously change shape, shifting its state by a simple rotational translation from one polyhedra to the other. noMad is operating on distinct scales of intelligence and autonomy, each autonomously self-assembling to the next higher order of organisation – from a highly mobile, nomadic state to high population spatial collective. noMad proposes a behavioural fabrication system that marks a shift of our build environment as a finite lifecycle construct, but is instead looking for autonomous, non-finite and real-time solutions to adapt dynamically to the demands of its environment - constantly restructuring itself."</em> <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/158470-nomad-open-source-self-assembly-system">[...]</a>

There are a couple of significant issues associated with use of the SoftwareSerial class: It requires use of 2 pins, 1 for transmit and 1 for receive, even though serial output requires only transmit It uses a Pin Change interrupt for receive, therefore tying up a device Port. In fact, it allocates ALL the device ports to the receive pin change ISR.Fortunately, Nick Gammon modified the SoftwareSerial class to create a transmit only version, SendOnlySoftwareSerial, which requires only 1 device pin and no interrupts. This instructable follows the steps of the previous SoftwareSerial instructable pointing out the differences in use of the SendOnlySoftwareSerial class for serial output.

<h2><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Driftwood-Binary-Clock/">Driftwood Binary Clock</a></h2>

<p><em>"Binary clocks have always attracted my attention and here is my version. There are a number of design elements that I believe sets it apart from other variants described on Instructables and other internet sites: Addressable RGB LEDs have been mounted on a copper frame that is external to the body that houses the electronics. An IR remote is used to set the time / alarm, snooze the alarm, select a display colour. The alarm tone is able to be easily personalised. Its in a piece of driftwood! !The use of the external frame to support the LEDs was due to how much I liked the completed look of the display."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Driftwood-Binary-Clock/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"What’s up my friends, welcome back. Almost all of my DIY project have a 3D printed case of some sort of printed part. To print an object, you first need the 3D file. You have the file, you print the object. This project will do just the opposite, you have the object you get the 3D file. This machine should be able to 3D scan small objects with dimensions up to 13cm in the x and Y directions."</em> <a href="http://www.electronoobs.com/eng_arduino_tut30.php">[...]</a>
