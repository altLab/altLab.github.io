<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1755, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fausto_Elhuyar">Fausto Elhuyar</a>. Este Químico e mineralogista espanhol ajudou o seu irmão mais velho, Juan José, em experiências para separar o metal de tungsténio do seu minério de volframita. Dois anos antes, o químico sueco Carl Scheele descobriu o ácido tungsténico, embora não isolasse a forma elementar, de um mineral conhecido desde 1758 como tung sten (pedra sueca, pesada, que agora é conhecida como scheelita). Os irmãos Elhuyar, trabalhando no Seminário de Bergara, conseguiram extrair o metal reduzindo o ácido tungsténico com carvão. Pela primeira vez, os cientistas bascos entraram na história da ciência.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1855, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gayley">James Gayley</a>. Este Metalurgico Norte-americano inventou um dispositivo para garantir humidade uniforme na corrente de ar que entrava nos altos-fornos. Com experiência prévia em várias obras de ferro, Gayley foi contratado pela Edgar Thomson Steel Works como supervisor dos Altos Fornos (1885). Nesta capacidade era um economista, e fez uma redução recorde no consumo de coque. Ele inventou a placa de refrigeração de bronze para as paredes do alto-forno, o suporte de fundição auxiliar para as fabricas de aço da Bessemer, e foi o primeiro a usar o motor de sopro de condensação composto com o alto-forno. Ele também inventou a explosão do ar seco, para o qual o Franklin Institute lhe concedeu a medalha Elliott Cresson.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1884, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Bergius">Friedrich Bergius</a>. Este químico alemão inventou um processo para converter pó de carvão e hidrogénio directamente em gasolina e óleos lubrificantes sem isolar produtos intermediários (Stuttgart, 25 jun 1921). Bergius conseguiu, durante a destilação do carvão, forçar o hidrogénio sob alta pressão a combinar-se quimicamente com o carvão, transformando mais carbono do carvão em óleos do que é possível com a destilação convencional. Para resolver problemas de distribuição de calor e regulação de temperatura, Bergius inventou o tratamento de uma mistura de carvão pulverizado em óleo com o gás sob alta pressão. Pelo seu trabalho no desenvolvimento do método químico de hidrogenação em alta pressão necessário para esse processo, ele partilhou o Prémio Nobel de 1931 em Química com Carl Bosch, da Alemanha.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1943, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Stonebraker">Michael Stonebraker</a>. Este cientista da computação especializado em pesquisa em base de dados criou a pesquisa e os produtos da Stonebraker. Ele também é o fundador de muitas empresas de base de dados, incluindo a Ingres Corporation, a Illustra, a Paradigm4, a StreamBase Systems, a Tamr, a Vertica e a VoltDB, e foi director técnico da Informix. Ele também é editor do livro Readings in Database Systems. A carreira de Stonebraker pode ser dividida em duas fases: na Universidade da Califórnia, Berkeley, quando se concentrou em sistemas de gestão de bases de dados relacionais, como Ingres e Postgres, e no Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), onde desenvolveu técnicas mais novas de gestão de dados. como C-Store, H-Store e SciDB. Os principais prémios incluem o Prémio Turing em 2015.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que a sonda Voyager 2 da NASA, com mais de 40 anos, está a beira de abandonar o sistema Solar. Originalmente construídas para durarem apenas cinco anos e para recolherem só informação sobre Júpiter e Saturno, de forma espantosa, esta sonda acompanhada pela Voyager 1 acabaram por durar (muito) mais do que o esperado. A missão de quatro décadas da NASA é igualmente conhecida por ter enviado com cada uma das Voyager um disco de cobre coberto de ouro de 30 centímetros de diâmetro onde está registada informação sobre a vida na Terra. Entre os dados integrados estão fotografias, sons ambiente, músicas e saudações em 55 línguas diferentes - entre as quais uma em português.</p>

<p>Também esta semana ficámos a saber que a missão que parecia ser rotineira de transportar os cosmonautas da NASA Nick Hague e o Russo Alexey Ovchinin a bordo do foguetão Soyuz, teve problemas. Uma falha nos propulsores do foguetão obrigou a uma aterragem de emergência. Apenas minutos após lançamento surgiram os problemas técnicos devido à falha nos propulsores. Apesar do susto, ambos os cosmonautas encontram-se bem. De acordo com o correspondente da BBC Jonathan Amos, os cosmonautas ter-se-ão apercebido que algo estava errado "porque eles relataram sentir-se sem peso quando deveriam sentir-se empurrados para trás nos seus lugares" pela aceleração.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como alguns modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis. É apresentada a newelectronics de 8 de Outubro de 2018.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7252">NASA Voyager 2 Could Be Nearing Interstellar Space</a></h2>

<p><em>"NASA's Voyager 2 probe, currently on a journey toward interstellar space, has detected an increase in cosmic rays that originate outside our solar system. Launched in 1977, Voyager 2 is a little less than 11 billion miles (about 17.7 billion kilometers) from Earth, or more than 118 times the distance from Earth to the Sun. Since 2007 the probe has been traveling through the outermost layer of the heliosphere -- the vast bubble around the Sun and the planets dominated by solar material and magnetic fields. Voyager scientists have been watching for the spacecraft to reach the outer boundary of the heliosphere, known as the heliopause. Once Voyager 2 exits the heliosphere, it will become the second human-made object, after Voyager 1, to enter interstellar space. Since late August, the Cosmic Ray Subsystem instrument on Voyager 2 has measured about a 5 percent increase in the rate of cosmic rays hitting the spacecraft compared to early August."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7252">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.popsci.com/soyuz-emergency-ballistic-landing">Two astronauts just survived a 'ballistic descent' in a Russian rocket. Here's everything we know</a></h2>

<p><em>"On Thursday at 4:40 a.m. Eastern time, NASA's Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Alexey Ovchinin launched aboard the Soyuz MS-10 spacecraft from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The two men were set for a sixth-month stint on the International Space Station—Hague's first—but a booster problem during launch forced them to make a rare emergency landing. About two minutes into the ascent, Russian ground control could be heard referring to a "failure of the booster." At the time of posting, audio of the incident is still available via NASA's livestream of the event: The crew, both of whom are reportedly in "good condition," went into "ballistic descent mode," which NASA tweeted involved "a sharper angle of landing compared to normal." The capsule containing the astronauts successfully separated from the rocket booster and parachuted the ground, where rescue teams in helicopters rushed to meet them. According to the BBC's Jonathan Amos, the astronauts would have realized something was wrong "because they reported feeling weightless when they should have felt pushed back in their seats" by a booster separation."</em> <a href="https://www.popsci.com/soyuz-emergency-ballistic-landing">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The fourth Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) built Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) protected communications satellite is one step closer to space. The AEHF-4 satellite was encapsulated into its payload fairing on September 26 in anticipation of its October 17 launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida, on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket. "This fourth satellite will complete a worldwide ring of AEHF satellites to deliver global extended data rate (XDR) coverage for the U.S. Air Force and for the partner nations – Canada, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom – that also connect to the AEHF network," said Mike Cacheiro, Lockheed Martin vice president of protected communications. "The Silicon Valley-based team that built this satellite can't wait to see it lift off. And in the meantime, we're making great progress on producing the fifth and sixth satellites in the constellation." AEHF communications are jam-proof and offer low probability of detection or interception, and the four AEHF satellite constellation will be able to deliver that capability worldwide."</em> <a href="https://news.lockheedmartin.com/2018-10-08-Lockheed-Martin-Built-Advanced-Extremely-High-Frequency-Satellite-Packed-and-Prepared-to-Join-the-Constellation">[...]</a>

The collaborators -- materials scientists and engineers at Northwestern and neurosurgeons at Washington University -- developed a device that delivers regular pulses of electricity to damaged peripheral nerves in rats after a surgical repair process, accelerating the regrowth of nerves in their legs and enhancing the ultimate recovery of muscle strength and control. The size of a dime and the thickness of a sheet of paper, the wireless device operates for about two weeks before naturally absorbing into the body.

<h2><a href="https://www.tum.de/en/about-tum/news/press-releases/detail/article/34984/">New materials and methods in 3D printing</a></h2>

<p><em>"Components for vehicles and cars, individual medical implants or even building facades and entire houses: Additive manufacturing, also known informally as 3D printing, is revolutionizing manufacturing technologies. An expert conference at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) illustrates the wide spectrum covered by this technology and provides an insight into the broadly deployed expertise of TUM. Additive manufacturing includes a number of different processes in which the workpiece is built by applying one level or element of building material at a time. This type of manufacturing has many advantages: Designers have more freedom in creating objects, certain functions can be integrated directly in the workpiece, and the manufacture of individually customized products is economically viable, even with small production batch sizes. Researchers at TUM are using and researching these processes in a number of projects. At the Chair of Timber Construction and Structural Design in the TUM Department of Civil, Geo and Environmental Engineering, concrete components are being produced using a 3D printer."</em> <a href="https://www.tum.de/en/about-tum/news/press-releases/detail/article/34984/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"An international team of researchers, affiliated with UNIST has presented an innovative wearable technology that will turn your skin into a loudspeaker. This breakthrough has been led by Professor Hyunhyub Ko in the School of Energy and Chemical Engineering at UNIST. Created in part to help the hearing and speech impaired, the new technology can be further explored for various potential applications, such as wearable IoT sensors and conformal health care devices. In the study, the research team has developed ultrathin, transparent, and conductive hybrid nanomembranes with nanoscale thickness, consisting of an orthogonal silver nanowire array embedded in a polymer matrix. They, then, demonstrated their nanomembrane by making it into a loudspeaker that can be attached to almost anything to produce sounds. The researchers also introduced a similar device, acting as a microphone, which can be connected to smartphones and computers to unlock voice-activated security systems."</em> <a href="http://news.unist.ac.kr/transparent-loudspeakers-and-mics-that-let-your-skin-play-music/">[...]</a>

The new polyamides are not only transparent, but also have a high thermal stability. Plastics are a useful alternative to glass or metal for a wide range of applications.

Two-legged robots are a little bit more straightforward in some ways, and four-legged robots are statically stable much of the time. You can see where this is going—there’s a general trend toward more legs being more stable and potentially easier to control, especially as terrain complexity increases. So what happens if you take that logic to an extreme? As it turns out, you end up with a spherical robot made of 32 individually actuated telescoping legs, named Mochibot. Mochibot’s shape is based on a rhombic triacontahedron, which is a polyhedron with 32 vertices and 30 faces made of rhombuses (or rhombi)."</em> <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-hardware/32-legged-spherical-robot-moves-like-an-amoeba">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Data storage devices are not improving as fast as scientists would like. Faster and more compact memory storage devices will become a reality when physicists gain precise control of the spins of electrons. They typically rely on ultra-short lasers to control spins. However, improvement of storage devices via spin control requires first to develop ways of controlling the forces acting on these electronic spins. In a recent study published in EPJ B, John Kay Dewhurst and colleagues, have developed a new theory to predict the complex dynamics of spin procession once a material is subjected to ultra-short laser pulses. The advantage of this approach, which takes into account the effect of internal spin rotation forces, is that it is predictive."</em> <a href="https://phys.org/news/2018-10-precise-electron-yields-faster-memory.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A new material that is as stiff as metal but flexible enough to withstand strong vibrations could transform the car manufacturing industry, say experts from the University of Surrey. In a paper published in Scientific Reports, scientists from Surrey joined forces with Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and the University of California to develop a material that has high stiffness and damping. The team achieved this near impossible combination in a material by using 3-D woven technical textile composite sheets, with selected unbonded fibres – allowing the inside of the material to move and absorb vibrations, while the surrounding material remains rigid. Researchers believe their new material could usher in a new wave of trains, cars, and aircrafts, allowing customers to experience little to no vibration during their travels. Dr. Stefan Szyniszewski, lead author of the study and assistant professor of materials and structures at the University of Surrey, said: "The idea of a composite the resolves the paradox of stiffness and damping was thought to be impossible – yet here we are. This is an exciting development that could send shock waves through the car, train and aerospace manufacturing industries."</em> <a href="https://phys.org/news/2018-10-future-cars-revolutionary-material.html">[...]</a>

Since a robot can be statically stable on three or more legs, a hexapod robot has a great deal of flexibility in how it can move. If legs become disabled, the robot may still be able to walk. Furthermore, not all of the robot's legs are needed for stability; other legs are free to reach new foot placements or manipulate a payload.

<p><em>"A buck converter (step-down converter) is a DC-to-DC power converter which steps down voltage (while stepping up current) from its input (supply) to its output (load). It is a class of switched-mode power supply (SMPS) typically containing at least two semiconductors (a diode and a transistor, although modern buck converters frequently replace the diode with a second transistor used for synchronous rectification) and at least one energy storage element, a capacitor, inductor, or the two in combination. To reduce voltage ripple, filters made of capacitors (sometimes in combination with inductors) are normally added to such a converter's output (load-side filter) and input (supply-side filter).

<p><em>"Servos (also RC servos) are small, cheap, mass-produced servomotors used for radio control and small-scale robotics. The are designed to be easily controlled: the position of the internal potentiometer is continually compared to the commanded position from the control device (i.e., the radio control). Any difference gives rise to an error signal in the appropriate direction, which drives the electric motor either forwards or backwards, and moving the shaft to the commanded position. When the servo reaches this position, the error signal reduces and then becomes zero, at which point the servo stops moving. Radio control servos are connected through a standard three-wire connection: two wires for a DC power supply and one for control, carrying a pulse-width modulation (PWM) signal. The standard voltage is 4.8 V DC, however 6 V and 12 V is also used on a few servos."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/556-Servo-Driver/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In science and in engineering worlds keeping track of temperature aka (movement of the atoms in thermodynamics) is one of the fundamental physical parameters one should consider almost everywhere, starting from cell biology up to hard fuel rocket engines and thrusts. In computers and basically everywhere where I forgot to mention. The idea behind this instrument was pretty simple. While developing firmware I needed a test setup where I could test the firmware for the bugs instead of our products, which are handcrafted by technicians not to be causing any kind of malfunctions related to above mentioned. Those instruments tend to get hot and therefore constant and precise temperature monitoring is needed in order to keep all the parts of the instrument up and running, and which is not less important performing outstandingly. Using NTC thermistors to solve the task has several benefits."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/High-Precision-Temperature-Controller/">[...]</a>
