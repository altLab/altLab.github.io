<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1766, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dalton">John Dalton</a>. Este químico, físico e meteorologista inglês investigou as propriedades físicas e químicas da matéria e deduziu uma teoria atómica (1803) em que os átomos do mesmo elemento são os mesmos, mas diferentes dos átomos de qualquer outro elemento. Em 1804, ele estabeleceu a sua lei de múltiplas proporções, pela qual ele relacionava as proporções dos pesos dos reagentes com as proporções de elementos nos compostos. Ele determinou que o peso atómico do hidrogénio era igual a um e desenvolveu uma tabela de pesos atómicos para outros elementos. Ele foi o primeiro a medir a mudança de temperatura do ar sob compressão e, em 1801, sugeriu que todos os gases poderiam ser liquefeitos por alta pressão e baixa temperatura. Dalton reconheceu que a aurora boreal era um fenómeno eléctrico.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1892, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Victor_Appleton">Edward Appleton</a>. Este físico inglês recebeu o Prémio Nobel da Física em 1947 pela sua descoberta da camada de Appleton da ionosfera. A partir de 1919, dedicou-se a problemas científicos em física atmosférica, usando principalmente técnicas de rádio. Ele provou a existência da ionosfera e encontrou uma camada de 60 milhas acima do solo que reflectia as ondas de rádio. Em 1926, ele encontrou outra camada a 150 milhas acima do solo, mais alta que a camada de Heaviside, electricamente mais forte e capaz de reflectir ondas curtas em redor da Terra. Essa camada de Appleton é um reflector confiável de ondas de rádio e mais útil na comunicação do que outras camadas ionosféricas que reflectem ondas de rádio esporadicamente, dependendo da temperatura e da hora do dia.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1901, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Weber_(engineer)">Ernst Weber</a>. Este Engenheiro electrotécnico austro-americano  contribuiu para o desenvolvimento da tecnologia de microondas, aplicado em sistemas de radar e comunicações. Durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial, ele liderou uma equipa de pesquisadores para resolver os problemas de medir com precisão microondas de alta frequência, essenciais para a calibração dos radares. (Isto envolvia aprender a revestir tubos de vidro com uma camada muito fina de metal condutor, que Weber derivou da antiga habilidade de decorar louças com ouro e prata, seguida pelo sucesso usando uma mistura de platina e paládio.). A equipa criou outros projectos e técnicas de produção que ajudaram no desenvolvimento geral do radar durante a guerra.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1906, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Federico_Leloir">Luis Federico Leloir</a>. Este Bioquímico argentino ganhou o Prémio Nobel da Química em 1970 pela "sua descoberta de nucleotídeos de açúcar e seu papel na biossíntese de carboidratos" (investigações dos processos pelos quais os carboidratos são convertidos em energia no corpo). Leloir trabalhando em circunstâncias simples, isolou a glucose do difosfato de uridina e mostrou que foi incorporado no glicogénio na presença de uma enzima do fígado. Ele também descobriu o mecanismo de síntese de amido. As descobertas de Leloir - que os nucleotídeos de açúcar são actores principais na interconversão de açúcares e formação de polissacarídeos - levaram a pesquisas adicionais no metabolismo de carboidratos e nas implicações médicas das descobertas.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1908, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Essen">Louis Essen</a>. Este físico inglês inventou o relógio de cristal de quartzo e o primeiro relógio atómico prático. Estes dispositivos eram capazes de medir o tempo com mais precisão do que qualquer relógio anterior. Ele construiu um relógio atómico com feixe de césio, um dispositivo que finalmente mudou a maneira como o tempo é medido. Cada elemento químico e composto absorve e emite radiação electromagnética nas suas próprias frequências características. Essas ressonâncias são inerentemente estáveis ao longo do tempo e do espaço. A frequência natural do átomo de césio foi formalmente reconhecida como a nova unidade internacional do tempo em 1967: a segunda foi definida como exactamente 9.192.631.770 oscilações ou ciclos da frequência ressonante do átomo de césio, substituindo o antigo segundo definido em termos do movimento da Terra.</p>

<p>Esta semana ficámos a conhecer o trabalho que uma engenheira de software que hackeou uma máquina de tricotar malhas doméstica. Esta australiana passou anos a hackear e programar uma máquina tricotar de tricô dos anos 80 para se divertir. Este hobby cresceu muito mais, quando Spencer desenvolveu um novo algoritmo de computador que fazia algo nunca antes realizado com essas máquinas. A sua realização - tricotar com o apoio da vista aérea usando uma malha por pixel em três cores - pode não significar muito para alguém fora da comunidade de tricô. Mas essa conquista permitiu que Spencer fizesse algo verdadeiramente extraordinário. Após 100 horas e 15 quilos de lã ela criou uma peça que apresenta todas as 88 constelações vistas da Terra, bem como a linha equatorial com as constelações do Zodíaco, estrelas dimensionadas de acordo com o brilho correcto, a Via Láctea, o Sol, a Lua da Terra e todos os planetas dentro do nosso sistema solar. A esta peça ela chamou "Stargazing".</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como um modelo 3D  que poderá ser útil. É apresentado o livro "Network Programming with Go".</p>

<p><em>"By hacking a domestic knitting machine, a software engineer advanced modern knitting and made a massive equatorial star map in tapestry form. Australian software engineer Sarah Spencer spent years hacking and programming a 1980s domestic knitting machine for fun. This hobby grew into much more, however, as Spencer developed a new computer algorithm that did something never before accomplished with such machines. Her accomplishment — knitting with bird's-eye backing using one knit per pixel in three colors — might not mean much to anyone outside of the knitting community. But this achievement allowed Spencer to make something truly out of this world. "As a woman in tech, I wanted to create something which would engage young minds in an area of STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics)," Spencer said in a statement emailed to Space.com."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/41683-hacked-knitting-machine-builds-stellar-map.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The dynamic programming language, which is free and open source, combines the speed and popular features of the best scientific and technical software. After years of tinkering, the dynamic programming language Julia 1.0 was officially released to the public during JuliaCon, an annual conference of Julia users held recently in London. The release of Julia 1.0 is a huge Julia milestone since MIT Professor Alan Edelman, Jeff Bezanson, Stefan Karpinski, and Viral Shah released Julia to developers in 2012, says Edelman. “Julia has been revolutionizing scientific and technical computing since 2009,” says Edelman, the year the creators started working on a new language that combined the best features of Ruby, MatLab, C, Python, R, and others. Edelman is director of the Julia Lab at MIT and one of the co-creators of the language at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL). Julia, which was developed and incubated at MIT, is free and open source, with more than 700 active open source contributors, 1,900 registered packages, 41,000 GitHub stars, 2 million downloads, and a reported 101 percent annual rate of download growth."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2018/mit-developed-julia-programming-language-debuts-juliacon-0827">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://news.tpu.ru/en/news/2018/09/04/33608/">Scientists reveal protection of optical fiber against biomolecules</a></h2>

<p><em>"Unmodified optical fibers actively interact with components of biological media that literally deposit on their surface and thus do not allow them to function. Due to the effect of surface plasmon resonance and iodonium salts scientists grafted a very thin protective shell on fibers, which prevent them from interacting with undesirable substances. In Advanced Materials Interfaces (IF 4.834; Q1) researchers from Tomsk Polytechnic University and colleagues from the Czech Republic and USA proposed a novel method how to modify the surface of optical fibers in order to prevent contacts with biomolecules in living media. Optical fibers are thin quartz glass filaments in which information is transmitted by light. They are widely used in fiber-optic communication. One of their promising applications is medicine and biomedical technology."</em> <a href="https://news.tpu.ru/en/news/2018/09/04/33608/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://pratt.duke.edu/about/news/smith-desi">Duke-Northrop Grumman Partnership Seeks to Unflatten Metamaterial Antennas</a></h2>

<p><em>"Researchers from Duke University are teaming up with colleagues at the University of Washington and industry experts at Northrop Grumman to develop metamaterial antennas tailored to the contours and angles of modern military aircraft. The collaboration is the result of a new pilot program from the Department of Defense called the Defense Enterprise Science Initiative (DESI). Backing five university-industry teams pursuing independent projects, DESI is focused on accelerating the impact of basic research on defense capabilities. “Optimizing a metamaterial antenna’s shape for both aerodynamics and electromagnetic performance simultaneously is a challenging task,” said David Smith, the James B. Duke Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Duke and one of the original co-inventors of the technology. “But with the help of Northrop Grumman’s expertise and capabilities in the realm of aeronautics, we’re confident we can produce aerodynamic metamaterial antennas with extraordinary mission flexibility.” Metamaterials are artificial materials that manipulate waves like light and sound through properties of their structure rather than their chemistry. Most metamaterials are composed of a grid of repeating cells, each of which can be individually tuned to steer electromagnetic waves along a gradient—a concept called transformation optics."</em> <a href="https://pratt.duke.edu/about/news/smith-desi">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The effect has been predicted theoretically decades ago - but it is very hard to provide experimental evidence for it: "Superradiance" is the phenomenon of one atom giving off energy in the form of light and causing a large number of other atoms in its immediate vicinity to emit energy as well at the same time. This creates a short, intense flash of light. Up until now, this phenomenon could only be studied with free atoms (and with the use of special symmetries). Now, at TU Wien (Vienna), it was measured in a solid-state system. The team used nitrogen atoms, built into tiny diamonds that can be coupled with microwave radiation. The results have now been published in the journal "Nature Physics"."</em> <a href="https://www.tuwien.ac.at/en/news/news_detail/article/126159/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Technion researchers have developed an innovative method for increasing the efficiency of electro-optical devices by increasing the interaction between light and matter. In findings published in Advanced Materials, the researchers report that they successfully implemented the method to produce a photoelectrochemical solar cell used to generate hydrogen from water, using solar energy. The new method stems from the production of meta-materials that increase the light-matter interaction in ultrathin absorber layers. These materials are made of multi-layer structures that combine thin layers of insulators, metals and semiconducting metal-oxides. The research was conducted by doctoral student Asaf Kay and postdoctoral researcher Dr. Barbara Scherrer with the guidance of the head of the research group, Prof. Avner Rothschild of the Department of Materials Science and Engineering. Hydrogen is a promising fuel because it is the lightest and cleanest fuel."</em> <a href="http://ats.org/news/researchers-develop-new-method-to-increase-electro-optical-device-efficiency/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Blending hydrogels with gold nanoparticles can produce a transistor for extra-sensitive sensors Hydrogels are essentially a gel in which the liquid component is water. They have been shown to act as a kind of power source or even as kind of stretchable touch screen that you could wear. Now researchers at the University of Utah have used hydrogels to make a switch for transistors that could be called “squishy” because of their flexibility and stretchable quality. In research described in IEEE Electron Device Letters, the Utah researchers fabricated a metal-oxide hydrogel field-effect transistor (MOHFET) with a channel composed of a hydrogel embedded with gold nanoparticles. The switching mechanism for the hydrogel is quite different from a typical silicon-based switch, which is turned on by making the channel more conducting. In gold nanoparticle switches, the particles are always conducting and they are brought closer to the device electrodes to turn on the device."</em> <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/nanoclast/semiconductors/materials/squishy-transistors-lead-to-sharklike-electrical-sensors">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A novel possibility of manipulating cellular functions A team of researchers have discovered that terahertz (THz) wave irradiation activates the filamentation of actin protein. Drs. Shota Yamazaki and Masahiko Harata (Graduate School of Agricultural Science, Tohoku University); Dr. Yuichi Ogawa (Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University); Dr. Hiromichi Hoshina (THz imaging and the sensing team at RIKEN); and Dr. Toshitaka Idehara (FIR-UF at University of Fukui) have made this important discovery, which offers a new possibility for the manipulation of cellular functions. Due to the recent development of high power THz (1012 Hz) wave sources, many researchers have begun to explore its application for material manipulation. One of the advantages of THz wave irradiation is its lower photon energy as compared to visible light.

<p><em>"Scientists find a theoretical optical device may have uses in quantum computing. Nearly 150 years ago, the physicist James Maxwell proposed that a circular lens that is thickest at its center, and that gradually thins out at its edges, should exhibit some fascinating optical behavior. Namely, when light is shone through such a lens, it should travel around in perfect circles, creating highly unusual, curved paths of light. He also noted that such a lens, at least broadly speaking, resembles the eye of a fish. The lens configuration he devised has since been known in physics as Maxwell’s fish-eye lens — a theoretical construct that is only slightly similar to commercially available fish-eye lenses for cameras and telescopes. Now scientists at MIT and Harvard University have for the first time studied this unique, theoretical lens from a quantum mechanical perspective, to see how individual atoms and photons may behave within the lens."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2018/fish-eye-lens-may-entangle-pairs-atoms-0905">[...]</a>

The international AWAKE collaboration has made a breakthrough in its efforts to build a new type of particle accelerator. The experiment, in which electrons surf on a plasma wave, accelerates particles with far less effort than is required with the LHC, for example, or with other particle accelerators used to date. Thus, physicists could bring about particle collisions with significantly more energy than has been possible so far. Studying the traces of these collisions may help scientists to gain new insights into the Big Bang and the structure of matter. However powerful the current apparatus such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN may be, it can already be foreseen that significantly more energy will be needed in order to answer questions about particle physics that remain open."</em> <a href="https://www.mpg.de/12240838/awake-particle-accelerator-plasma-wave">[...]</a>

The findings appear online Sept. 5 in the journal Nature. The key principle behind this new work is quantum teleportation, a unique feature of quantum mechanics that has previously been used to transmit unknown quantum states between two parties without physically sending the state itself. Using a theoretical protocol developed in the 1990s, Yale researchers experimentally demonstrated a quantum operation, or “gate,” without relying on any direct interaction. Such gates are necessary for quantum computation that relies on networks of separate quantum systems — an architecture that many researchers say can offset the errors that are inherent in quantum computing processors. Through the Yale Quantum Institute, a Yale research team led by principal investigator Robert Schoelkopf and former graduate student Kevin Chou is investigating a modular approach to quantum computing."</em> <a href="https://news.yale.edu/2018/09/05/yale-researchers-teleport-quantum-gate">[...]</a>

<p><em>"MIT researchers develop inexpensive way to perform full lifecycle analysis of design choices as buildings are being planned. Typically, when architects or engineers design a new building, it’s only at the end of the process — if ever — that a lifecycle analysis of the building’s environmental impact is carried out. And by then, it may be too late to make significant changes. Now, a faster and easier system for doing such analyses could change all that, making the analysis an integral part of the design process from the beginning. The new process, described in the journal Building and Environment in a paper by MIT researchers Jeremy Gregory, Franz-Josef Ulm and Randolph Kirchain, and recent graduate Joshua Hester PhD ’18, is simple enough that it could be integrated into the software already used by building designers so that it becomes a seamless addition to their design process.

In electronics, solder is used to connect two parts together. As a bridge, one of its most important functions is to transfer heat away from critical electronic components and toward the heat sink, which uses air or water to safely dissipate heat. As technological advances allow for the creation of smaller and more powerful computers and electronics — and with temperatures in computer chips reaching higher than 100°C — this heat dissipation function has become more crucial than ever. Conventional solders are limited in their ability to conduct heat effectively over a long lifetime, making heat dissipation an obstacle for further computing and electronics development.

In a study published today in the journal Science Advances, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) researchers, along with their counterparts at Harvard University, report on the hierarchical 3D printing of nanoporous gold, a proof of concept that researchers say could revolutionize the design of chemical reactors. “If you consider traditional machining processes, it’s time consuming and you waste a lot of materials — also, you don’t have the capability to create complex structures,” said LLNL postdoctoral researcher Zhen Qi, a co-author on the paper. “By using 3D printing we can realize macroporous structures with application-specific flow patterns. By creating hierarchical structures, we provide pathways for fast mass transport to take full advantage of the large surface area of nanoporous materials.

It creates a very neat and compact layout. Reworking is quicker and easier. No messy 'mat of wires' on the underside.

If you are familiar with Python or looking for a quick way to write code for a microcontroller (that isn’t C/C++, Arduino, or assembly), MicroPython is a good option. Some development boards, like the pyboard and micro:bit, are capable of running MicroPython out of the box.
