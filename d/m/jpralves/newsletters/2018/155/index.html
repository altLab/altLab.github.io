<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1801, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Fechner">Gustav Theodor Fechner</a>. Este físico e filósofo alemão que foi uma figura chave na fundação da psico-física, a ciência preocupada com as relações quantitativas entre as sensações e os estímulos que as produzem. Ele formulou a regra conhecida como a lei de Fechner, que, dentro de limites, a intensidade de uma sensação aumenta como o logaritmo do estímulo. Ele também propôs uma expressão matemática da teoria sobre a diferença entre dois estímulos, avançada por E. H. Weber.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1877, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ole_Evinrude">Ole Evinrude</a>. Este inventor norueguês e fabricante do motor marinho externo. Ole Evinrude estava a remar no seu pequeno barco um dia. Pareceu-lhe que o remo era mais difícil do que precisava, quando o seu objectivo era fazer um piquenique numa pequena ilha distante. Resolveu então e ali inventar um meio de mover pequenos barcos com rapidez e facilidade através da água. Quando descobriu uma maneira melhor, inventou o primeiro motor de popa prático em 1909. Ele patenteou-o em 1910; Rapidamente substituiu motores movidos a vapor e a pé por barcos e impulsionou uma nova indústria. O resultado foi o motor de popa Evinrude que permanece popular até hoje.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1880, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_W._Hull">Albert W. Hull</a>. Este físico americano que  descobriu independentemente o método de pó de análise de raios X de cristais (1917), que permite o estudo de materiais cristalinos num estado micro-cristalino finamente dividido, ou pó. O seu primeiro trabalho foi em tubos de electrões, cristalografia de raios X e piezoeletricidade. Na década de 1920, ele estudou medições de ruído em díodos e triodes. Nos anos 30, ele também se interessou pela metalurgia e pela ciência do vidro. A sua obra mais conhecida foi feita após a guerra, especialmente seu trabalho clássico sobre o efeito de um campo magnético uniforme no movimento de electrões entre cilindros coaxiais. Ele inventou também o magnetron (1921) e o thyratron (1927), e outros tubos de electrões com ampla aplicação como componentes em circuitos electrónicos.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1912, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_T._Seaborg">Glenn T. Seaborg</a>. Este químico nuclear americano durante 1940-58 com colegas seus da Universidade da Califórnia, Berkeley, produziram nove dos elementos transurânicos (plutónio ao nobélio) bombardeando urânio e outros elementos com núcleos num cíclotron. Ele cunhou o termo actinídeo para os elementos desta série. O trabalho sobre os elementos foi directamente relevante para o esforço da Segunda Guerra Mundial para desenvolver uma bomba atómica. Diz-se que ele foi influente na determinação da escolha do plutónio em vez do urânio nas primeiras experiências com bombas atómicas. Seaborg e seu antigo colaborador Edwin McMillan dividiram o Prémio Nobel da química de 1951. O elemento 106, seabórgio (1974), foi nomeado em sua homenagem.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que abriu na Suécia uma autoestrada especialmente construída para carregar veículos. São cerca de 2 km de estrada electrificada que incorporada numa via pública perto de Estocolmo. A tecnologia por detrás da electrificação da estrada que liga o aeroporto de Estocolmo Arlanda a um local de logística fora da capital visa resolver os problemas complicados de manter os veículos eléctricos carregados e o fabrico de suas baterias a preços acessíveis. A energia é transferida de dois trilhos do trilho na estrada por meio de um braço móvel preso na parte inferior de um veículo.</p>

<p>Ficámos igualmente a saber que um asteróide passou bastante perto da Terra. Um asteróide semelhante em tamanho a um que explodiu há mais de 100 anos na região russa de Tunguska, na Sibéria, passou relativamente próximo da Terra no domingo (15 de Abril), apenas um dia depois dos astrónomos descobrirem o objecto. O asteróide, designado 2018 GE3, teve mais próximo da Terra por volta das 2:41 am EDT (0641 GMT), a uma distância de 192.000 km, ou cerca de metade da distância média entre a Terra e a Lua. de acordo com o Centro de Estudos de Objectos Próximos à Terra da NASA (CNEOS). A NASA estimou que este asteróide mede de 48 a 110 metros de largura, fazendo com que seja até 3,6 vezes o tamanho do que derrubou 2000 quilómetros quadrados de floresta siberiana quando explodiu sobre Tunguska em 1908.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como um conjunto de modelos 3D de coberturas de ventoinhas. São apresentados dois livros da Texas Instruments, um sobre ADCs e outro sobre Op-Amps. São também apresentados mais três livros sobre Transístores.</p>

<p><em>"The world’s first electrified road that recharges the batteries of cars and trucks driving on it has been opened in Sweden. About 2km (1.2 miles) of electric rail has been embedded in a public road near Stockholm, but the government’s roads agency has already drafted a national map for future expansion. Sweden’s target of achieving independence from fossil fuel by 2030 requires a 70% reduction in the transport sector. The technology behind the electrification of the road linking Stockholm Arlanda airport to a logistics site outside the capital city aims to solve the thorny problems of keeping electric vehicles charged, and the manufacture of their batteries affordable. Energy is transferred from two tracks of rail in the road via a movable arm attached to the bottom of a vehicle. The design is not dissimilar to that of a Scalextric track, although should the vehicle overtake, the arm is automatically disconnected."</em> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/12/worlds-first-electrified-road-for-charging-vehicles-opens-in-sweden">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The ASTERIA satellite, which was deployed into low-Earth orbit in November, is only slightly larger than a box of cereal, but it could be used to help astrophysicists study planets orbiting other stars. Mission managers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, recently announced that ASTERIA has accomplished all of its primary mission objectives, demonstrating that the miniaturized technologies on board can operate in space as expected. This marks the success of one of the world's first astrophysics CubeSat missions, and shows that small, low-cost satellites could be used to assist in future studies of the universe beyond the solar system. "ASTERIA is small but mighty," said Mission Manager Matthew W. Smith of JPL. "Packing the capabilities of a much larger spacecraft into a small footprint was a challenge, but in the end we demonstrated cutting-edge performance for a system this size." Seeing Stars ASTERIA, or the Arcsecond Space Telescope Enabling Research in Astrophysics, weighs only 22 pounds (10 kilograms)."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7097">[...]</a>

<p><em>"An asteroid similar in size to one that exploded more than 100 years ago in Russia's Tunguska region in Siberia gave Earth a close shave on Sunday (April 15), just one day after astronomers discovered the object. The asteroid, designated 2018 GE3, made its closest approach to Earth at around 2:41 a.m. EDT (0641 GMT), whizzing by at a distance of 119,400 miles (192,000 kilometers), or about half the average distance between Earth and the moon, according to NASA's Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS). NASA estimated that this asteroid measures 157 to 360 feet (48 to110 meters) wide, making the space rock up to 3.6 times the size of the one that leveled 500,000 acres (2,000 square kilometers) of Siberian forest when it exploded over Tunguska in 1908.

<p><em>"Physicists at the University of Tübingen are developing a method for increasing the accuracy of high-precision sensors Quantum sensors already measure quantities such as temperature, magnetic field strength or accelerations very accurately. And they work even more precisely with chaotic dynamics. Physicists at the University of Tübingen showed this in a study in which they developed a method with which the measurement accuracy of high-precision sensors could be improved by a further 70 percent. Doctoral candidate Lukas Fiderer and Professor Daniel Braun from the Institute of Theoretical Physics used weak laser pulses in a computer simulation to disturb the dynamics of a magnetic field sensor. The results of the study were published in the journal Nature Communications.

<p><em>"Shopping well-fitting clothes online or making bespoke garments can be done more easily with the intelligent 3D human modelling technology developed by The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), which digitally reconstructs the shape and size of a person accurately from two full body photographs within 5-10 seconds. With online shopping gaining popularity, this PolyU innovation, developed by Dr Tracy P.Y. Mok, Associate Professor from the Institute of Textiles and Clothing at PolyU, and Dr Zhu Shuaiyin, PhD graduate of the same institute, can solve the ill-fitting problem and enhance the online shopping experience. Existing methods to achieve automatic shape modeling and dynamic poses deformation, including scan-based, image-based and example-based have known limitations. They involve expensive and bulky scanners and too much approximation, and therefore are of questionable accuracy.

<p><em>"In an article that appears in the journal “Review of Modern Physics”, researchers at the Laboratory for Attosecond Physics (LAP) assess the current state of the field of ultrafast physics and consider its implications for future technologies. Physicists can now control light in both time and space with hitherto unimagined precision. This is particularly true for the ability to generate ultrashort light pulses in the infrared and visible regions of the spectrum. Extremely high-energy laser pulses, each lasting for a few femtoseconds, have made spectacular experiments possible, which have in turn yielded revolutionary insights. Above all, the growth in understanding of the interaction between light and electrons opens up entirely new prospects for the future of electronics. In the journal Review of Modern Physics (10 April 2018), Dr. Stanislav Kruchinin, Prof. Ferenc Krausz and Dr. Vladislav Yakovlev from the Laboratory for Attosecond Physics (which is jointly run by Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität (LMU) and the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics (MPQ)) in Munich, provide a timely overview of current research in ultrafast solid-state physics."</em> <a href="http://www.mpq.mpg.de/5660186/18_04_12">[...]</a>

<p><em>"UCI engineers find that innovative material facilitates effective on-chip cooling Electronics miniaturization has put high-powered computing capability into the hands of ordinary people, but the ongoing downsizing of integrated circuits is challenging engineers to come up with new ways to thwart component overheating. Scientists at the University of California, Irvine made a breakthrough recently in verifying a new material configuration to facilitate cooling. In a study in the journal Nanotechnology, members of UCI’s Nano Thermal Energy Research Group highlight the attributes of holey silicon, a computer chip wafer with tiny, vertically etched orifices that work to shuttle heat to desired locations. “We found that heat prefers to travel vertically through but not laterally across holey silicon, which means the material can effectively move the heat from local hot spots to on-chip cooling systems in the vertical direction while sustaining the necessary temperature gradient for thermoelectric junctions in the lateral direction,” said corresponding author Jaeho Lee, UCI assistant professor of mechanical &amp; aerospace engineering. “This innovation could potentially be ideal for keeping electronic devices such as smartphones cool during operation,” said lead author Zongqing Ren, a graduate student researcher in the NTERG. He said that lab simulations demonstrated that the cooling effectiveness of holey silicon is at least 400 percent better than chalcogenides, compounds commonly used in thermoelectric cooling devices."</em> <a href="https://news.uci.edu/2018/04/12/could-holey-silicon-be-the-holy-grail-of-electronics/">[...]</a>

Our research points to this new combination as a much safer option. We’re excited that our findings might have the potential to change the landscape of information technology.” In their study, recently published in the journal Science Advances, the researchers outline their proposed combination which would allow for a more stable perpendicular anisotropic energy (PMA), the key driving component in a computer’s RAM (random-access memory) or data storage."</em> <a href="https://www.unh.edu/unhtoday/news/release/2018/04/12/unh-researchers-find-combination-small-data-storage-and-tinier-computers">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Controlling the anomalous and topological Hall effects by applying an electric field could lead to new types of memory and logic devices Two magnetic phenomena that could be harnessed for memory or logic applications can be controlled by simply applying an electric field to suitably designed structures, RIKEN researchers have shown1. The Hall effect was discovered in 1879 by Edwin Hall, who realized that applying a magnetic field at right angles to an electric current causes the flowing electrons to veer in the direction perpendicular to both the applied magnetic field and the current, creating a voltage in that direction. In ferromagnetic materials, the Hall effect can occur even without applying a magnetic field; in this case, it is called the anomalous Hall effect. Furthermore, in certain materials, local magnetic moments arrange themselves into stable vortex-like configurations known as skyrmions, and the fictitious magnetic field produced by the skyrmions gives rise to an analogous phenomenon known as the topological Hall effect. Both the anomalous and topological Hall effects arise due to the strong coupling between the spin and orbital angular momenta of electrons in some materials. Inspired by the recent observation of the topological Hall effect in structures consisting of SrRuO3 and SrIrO3, Jobu Matsuno from the RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science and his co-workers explored the effect of applying an electric field in heterostructures composed of these materials."</em> <a href="http://www.riken.jp/en/research/rikenresearch/highlights/20180413_0065/">[...]</a>

Using caffeine as a catalyst, the researchers have devised a way to create gummy, biocompatible gels that could be used for drug delivery and other medical applications. “Most synthetic approaches for synthesizing and cross-linking polymeric gels and other materials use catalysts or conditions that can damage sensitive substances such as biologic drugs. In contrast, here we used green chemistry and common food ingredients,” says Robert Langer, the David H.

<p><em>"2D materials produce a semi-floating gate memory that falls somewhere between DRAM and SRAM Researchers at Fudan University in Shanghai, China have leveraged two-dimensional (2D) materials to fabricate a relatively new gate design for transistors that may fill the gap between volatile and non-volatile memory. The result is what the researchers are dubbing a “quasi-non-volatile” device that combines the benefits of static random access memory (SRAM) and dynamic random access memory (DRAM). The new device will make up for DRAM’s limited data retention ability and its need to be frequently refreshed and SRAM’s high cost. In research described in Nature Nanotechnology, the Chinese researchers leveraged a gate design that has been gaining popularity, recently called semi-floating gate (SFG) memory technology. The SFG gate design is similar to a typical field effect transistor except that SFG transistor can “remember” the applied voltage from the gate. The researchers have shown that the 2D SFG memory they have fabricated has 156 times longer refresh time (10 seconds) than DRAM (64 milliseconds), which saves power, and ultrahigh-speed writing operations on nanosecond timescales (15 nanoseconds), which puts it on par with DRAM (10 nanoseconds)."</em> <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/nanoclast/semiconductors/devices/quasinonvolatile-memory-looks-to-fill-gap-between-volatile-and-nonvolatile-memory">[...]</a>

Measuring force with high sensitivity is important for investigating the fundamental physics of magnetic, atomic, quantum and surface phenomena.

Such a manual process is clearly unsuitable for industrial production of electronic devices containing van der Waals heterostructures Now, a Japanese research team led by the Institute of Industrial Science at The University of Tokyo has solved this issue by developing an automated robot that greatly speeds up the collection of 2D crystals and their assembly to form van der Waals heterostructures. The robot consists of an automated high-speed optical microscope that detects crystals, the positions and parameters of which are then recorded in a computer database."</em> <a href="http://www.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/news/2890/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=212666">Researchers Engineer New Pathways for Self-Assembled Nanostructures</a></h2>

<p><em>" One way that scientists control the structure of materials at the nanoscale – where features are a few to several hundred nanometers (nm) – is by using “self-assembly,” in which molecules are designed such that they spontaneously come together to form a desired structure or pattern. Self-assembly is a powerful approach to controlling order at the nanoscale and is one way that scientists can design certain properties into a material for specific applications, such as solar energy conversion and storage. Self-assembly is driven mainly by the system’s desire to minimize its energy and achieve equilibrium, but kinetic effects – the natural forces that move atoms and molecules around – can also play a strong role. Typically, these effects are viewed as complications to be overcome, but a collaboration of researchers from the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Brookhaven National Laboratory, Yale University, and the University of Warsaw (Poland) has recently shown that these effects can be exploited to engineer a nanostructure in a polymer thin film. Their results are published in the December 6, 2017 online edition of the journal Nanoscale. The group worked with a type of polymer known as a block copolymer."</em> <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=212666">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Known as the polychaete worm, it uses the tip of its jaw to inject lethal venom. The design of the jaw, with a gradient of hard materials at the tip connected to softer tissues, dissipates force and prevents serious damage to the jaw. The gradient in mechanical properties is correlated to the number of metal ions available for bonding. This mechanism inspired a novel approach to generate stiffness gradients in human-made polymers. Through a simple process, scientists controlled the density of the metal ions along a sample. The gradient in metal ion interactions created a continuous gradient in mechanical properties that spanned over a 200-fold change in stiffness, approaching that of biology."</em> <a href="https://science.energy.gov/bes/highlights/2018/bes-2018-04-e/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers have shown that certain superconductors – materials that carry electrical current with zero resistance at very low temperatures – can also carry currents of ‘spin’. The successful combination of superconductivity and spin could lead to a revolution in high-performance computing, by dramatically reducing energy consumption. Spin is a particle’s intrinsic angular momentum, and is normally carried in non-superconducting, non-magnetic materials by individual electrons. Spin can be ‘up’ or ‘down’, and for any given material, there is a maximum length that spin can be carried. In a conventional superconductor electrons with opposite spins are paired together so that a flow of electrons carries zero spin. A few years ago, researchers from the University of Cambridge showed that it was possible to create electron pairs in which the spins are aligned: up-up or down-down."</em> <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/some-superconductors-can-also-carry-currents-of-spin">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Cryptography experts at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) are kicking off an effort to protect the data created by innumerable tiny networked devices such as those in the “internet of things” (IoT), which will need a new class of cryptographic defenses against cyberattacks. Creating these defenses is the goal of NIST’s lightweight cryptography initiative, which aims to develop cryptographic algorithm standards that can work within the confines of a simple electronic device. Many of the sensors, actuators and other micromachines that will function as eyes, ears and hands in IoT networks will work on scant electrical power and use circuitry far more limited than the chips found in even the simplest cell phone. Similar small electronics exist in the keyless entry fobs to newer-model cars and the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags used to locate boxes in vast warehouses. All of these gadgets are inexpensive to make and will fit nearly anywhere, but common encryption methods may demand more electronic resources than they possess. Today, NIST is launching an effort to create worthy solutions to the problem of securing data in this sort of constrained environment."</em> <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2018/04/nist-issues-first-call-lightweight-cryptography-protect-small-electronics">[...]</a>

Two and a half years ago, a team of researchers led by groups at MIT, the University of California at Berkeley, and Boston University announced a milestone: the fabrication of a working microprocessor, built using only existing manufacturing processes, that integrated electronic and optical components on the same chip. The researchers’ approach, however, required that the chip’s electrical components be built from the same layer of silicon as its optical components. That meant relying on an older chip technology in which the silicon layers for the electronics were thick enough for optics. In the latest issue of Nature, a team of 18 researchers, led by the same MIT, Berkeley, and BU groups, reports another breakthrough: a technique for assembling on-chip optics and electronic separately, which enables the use of more modern transistor technologies.

Researchers led by a University of Houston engineer have reported a new class of soft robot, composed of ultrathin sensing, actuating electronics and temperature-sensitive artificial muscle that can adapt to the environment and crawl, similar to the movement of an inchworm or caterpillar. Cunjiang Yu, Bill D. Cook Assistant Professor of mechanical engineering, said potential applications range from surgery and rehabilitation to search and rescue in natural disasters or on the battlefield. Because the robot body changes shape in response to its surroundings, it can slip through narrow crevices to search for survivors in the rubble left by an earthquake or bombing, he said. “They sense the change in environment and adapt to slip through,” he said.

<p><em>"Soldering tiny SMD components can be quite challenging, but the process can also be automated. This can be done by applying soldering paste and baking it, either in a (reflow) oven or on a hot plate (like a cooking plate in your kitchen). Around the web, I've seen many DIY reflow ovens; in my opinion they have one big downside: they take up a lot of space. So I decided to build a hotplate instead. The hotplate is fully programmable, so that any reflow profile can be added. The reflow process is then fully automated."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Reflow-Soldering-Hotplate/">[...]</a>
