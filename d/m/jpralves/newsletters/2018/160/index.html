<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1544, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gilbert_(astronomer)">William Gilbert</a>. Este Cientista inglês, conhecido como o "pai dos estudos eléctricos" e pesquisador pioneiro do magnetismo, passou anos a investigar as atracções magnéticas e eléctricas. Gilbert definiu as designações atracção eléctrica, força eléctrica e pólo magnético. Ele tornou-se o homem mais ilustre da ciência na Inglaterra durante o reinado da rainha Elizabeth I. Observando que uma agulha da bússola não apenas aponta para o norte, mas também mergulha para baixo, ele pensa que a Terra age como um imã. Como Copérnico, ele acreditava que a Terra girava no seu eixo e que as estrelas fixas não estavam todas à mesma distância da Terra. Gilbert pensou que era uma forma de magnetismo que mantinha planetas nas suas órbitas.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1641, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayow">John Mayow</a>. Este químico inglês, cerca de cem anos antes de Joseph Priestley e Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier, identificou o spiritus nitroaereus (oxigénio) como uma entidade atmosférica distinta. Ele reconheceu ainda o papel do oxigénio na combustão de metais. Os seus textos médicos incluem uma descrição anatómica notavelmente correta da respiração.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1686, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Gabriel_Fahrenheit">Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit</a>. Este físico germano-holandês e fabricante de instrumentos (meteorológicos) ficou conhecido por ter inventado o termómetro de álcool (1709) e o termómetro de mercúrio (1714) e desenvolvido a escala de temperatura de Fahrenheit. Para o zero da sua escala, ele usou a temperatura de uma mistura igual de sal e gelo; 30° para o ponto de congelação da água; e 90° para a temperatura normal do corpo. Mais tarde, ajustou-se a 32° para o ponto de congelação da água e 212° para o ponto de ebulição da água, sendo o intervalo entre os dois dividido em 180 partes. Ele também inventou um higrómetro para medir a humidade relativa e experimentou com outros líquidos, descobrindo que cada líquido tinha um ponto de ebulição diferente que mudava com a pressão atmosférica. Actualmente a unidade de temperatura Fahrenheit é apenas usada no Estados Unidos, no Belize, nas ilhas Caimão e nas Bahamas.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1794, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Whewell">William Whewell</a>. Este filósofo e estudioso Inglês ficou conhecido pelo levantamento que fez do método científico e para a criação de palavras científicas. Ele fundou a cristalografia matemática e desenvolveu uma revisão da classificação de minerais de Friedrich Mohs. Ele criou as palavras cientista e físico por analogia com a palavra artista. Outras palavras úteis foram definidas para ajudar seus amigos: biometria para John Lubbock; Eocine, Miocene e Pliocene para Charles Lyell; e para Michael Faraday, ânodo, cátodo, dia-magnético, para-magnético e ião (de onde os diversos outros nomes de partículas terminam em -ião). Na meteorologia, Whewell inventou um anemómetro de autorregisto.</p>

<p>Esta semana foi apresentada a nova família de placas Arduino. A MKR Vidor 4000 e a Uno WiFi Rev 2. A MKR Vidor 4000 é a primeira Arduino baseada num chip FPGA, equipado com um microcontrolador SAM D21, um módulo WiFi Nina W102 da u-blox e um chip de criptografia ECC508 para conexão segura a redes locais e à Internet. A MKR Vidor 4000 é a mais recente adição à família MKR, projectada para uma ampla gama de aplicações IoT, com seu formato distinto e poder computacional para alto desempenho.</p>

<p>Foi igualmente anunciado esta semana, que em Novembro, em Versalhes, na França, representantes de 57 países vão fazer história. Vai ser votada a transformação do sistema internacional que sustenta a ciência e o comércio global. Esta acção finalmente concretizará o sonho de 150 anos dos cientistas de um sistema de medição baseado inteiramente em propriedades fundamentais imutáveis da natureza. O Sistema Internacional de Unidades (SI), informalmente conhecido como o sistema métrico - a maneira pela qual o mundo mede tudo, do café ao cosmos - vai mudar de uma maneira mais profunda do que qualquer coisa desde o seu estabelecimento após a Revolução Francesa.</p>

<p>Esta semana também a SpaceX lançou sondas gémeas da NASA para observar a água da Terra e cinco satélites de comunicações Iridium Next. A missão de transporte de carga descolou num foguetão Falcon 9 da Base Aérea de Vandenberg, na Califórnia, às 15h47. EDT (12:47 p.m. PDT, 1947 GMT). Para este lançamento, a SpaceX usou o mesmo foguete Falcon 9 que lançou a missão classificada Zuma para a Força Aérea dos EUA em Janeiro.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. É apresentada a revista HispaBrick que comemora 10 anos assim como a revista Hackspace número 7.</p>

<p><em>"This November, in Versailles, France, representatives from 57 countries are expected to make history. They will vote to dramatically transform the international system that underpins global science and trade. This single action will finally realize scientists’ 150-year dream of a measurement system based entirely on unchanging fundamental properties of nature. The International System of Units (SI), informally known as the metric system — the way in which the world measures everything from coffee to the cosmos — will change in a way that is more profound than anything since its establishment following the French Revolution. It will be a turning point for humanity.

<p><em>"SpaceX launched two new Earth science satellites for NASA and five Iridium Next communications satellites into orbit today (May 22). The ride-share mission lifted off on a pre-flown Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California at 3:47 p.m. EDT (12:47 p.m. PDT, 1947 GMT). "Liftoff for GRACE Follow-On, continuing the legacy of the GRACE mission of tracking the movement of water across our planet," NASA TV's launch commentator Gay Yee Hill announced as the Falcon 9 rocket soared into the sky. "That's a beautiful launch," replied her fellow commentator Sammy Kayali, director for the Office of Mission Safety and Success at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and former deputy manager for GRACE-FO. For today's launch, SpaceX used the same Falcon 9 rocket booster that launched the classified Zuma mission for the U.S. Air Force in January. Zuma ended up crashing into the ocean instead of reaching orbit, but investigators determined that the Falcon 9 rocket did not cause the accident."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/40672-spacex-launches-grace-fo-iridium-satellites.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Today I’m thrilled to share a new collaboration between Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) and Microsoft’s Quantum team demonstrating the power of quantum computing. With the goal of improving patient care, Case Western Reserve will use Microsoft’s quantum-inspired algorithms to enhance their approach to detecting cancerous tumors. This scenario is a great example of an organization using quantum technology to solve the real-world challenges of today. Case Western Reserve has been leading groundbreaking research in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a space that previously hadn’t drastically changed in decades. To improve accuracy of MRI results in less time, Case Western introduced an approach called magnetic resonance fingerprinting. Where typical MRI machines use a series of fixed acquisitions to establish a diagnosis, magnetic resonance fingerprinting uses a constantly varying sequence of pulses, resulting in a single, unified exam."</em> <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/05/18/microsoft-quantum-helps-case-western-reserve-university-advance-mri-research/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.microchip.com/pressreleasepage/easily-implement-low-power-touch-pads-with-surface-gestures">Easily Implement Low-power Touch Pads with Surface Gestures Using Microchip's New Software Library</a></h2>

<p><em>"Capacitive touch has become ubiquitous across a wide range of industries and applications, replacing the knobs and buttons that once controlled our electronics with smooth, intuitive touch panels. Previously a novelty on high-end products, consumers now expect touch control on everyday devices such as headphones, remote controls, coffee makers and thermostats without paying a premium for the interface. Microchip Technology Inc. (NASDAQ: MCHP) today announced a new 2D Touch Surface library that enables designers to easily implement touch pads using the company’s 8-bit PIC® and AVR® microcontrollers (MCUs) and 32-bit SAM MCUs. Available free of charge with the purchase of any compatible MCU, the library provides a simplified, low-cost solution for embedded applications. Ideal for implementing small touch pads and screens, the 2D Touch Surface library eliminates costs by running on a device’s existing MCU. This removes the need for a dedicated touch controller, giving product designers the flexibility to add finger position tracking and gesture detection, such as swipes, pinch and zoom, to products."</em> <a href="https://www.microchip.com/pressreleasepage/easily-implement-low-power-touch-pads-with-surface-gestures">[...]</a>

Where there are calmer winds, the robot can dip a keel into the water to ride like a highly efficient sailboat instead.

This shortcut may open possibilities in heat management of nanoscale materials. Imagine the possibility of a thermal circuit breaker, for example.” The scientists used neutron scattering to measure phasons with velocities about 2.8 times and about 4.3 times faster than the natural “speed limits” of longitudinal and transverse acoustic waves, respectively. “We didn't expect them to be going that fast without [fading],” Manley said."</em> <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/news/supersonic-waves-may-help-electronics-beat-heat">[...]</a>

For some time, researchers have been working on using two-dimensional materials, atomically thin nanomaterials, as components for faster-charging, longer-lasting batteries and supercapacitors.

In the search for ways to harvest small amounts of energy to run mobile electronic devices or sensors for health monitoring, researchers typically add hard ceramic nanoparticles or nanowires to a soft, flexible polymer support. The polymer provides the flexibility, while the piezo nanoparticles convert the mechanical energy into electrical voltage. But these materials are relatively inefficient, because upon mechanical loading the mechanical energy is largely absorbed by the bulk of the polymer, with a very small fraction being transferred to the piezo nanoparticles. While adding more ceramic would increase the energy efficiency, it comes with the tradeoff of less flexibility. “The hard ceramics in the soft polymer is like stones in water."</em> <a href="https://www.mri.psu.edu/mri/news/flexible-highly-efficient-multimodal-energy-harvesting">[...]</a>

Despite their promise, to date, most soft robots move slowly and clumsily when compared with many conventional robots."</em> <a href="http://www.news.ucsb.edu/2018/019016/soft-machines">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The first measurement of a subatomic particle’s mechanical property reveals the distribution of pressure inside the proton. Inside every proton in every atom in the universe is a pressure cooker environment that surpasses the atom-crushing heart of a neutron star. That’s according to the first measurement of a mechanical property of subatomic particles, the pressure distribution inside the proton, which was carried out by scientists at the Department of Energy's Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. The nuclear physicists found that the proton’s building blocks, the quarks, are subjected to a pressure of 100 decillion Pascal (1035) near the center of a proton, which is about 10 times greater than the pressure in the heart of a neutron star. The result was recently published in the journal Nature. “We found an extremely high outward-directed pressure from the center of the proton, and a much lower and more extended inward-directed pressure near the proton’s periphery,” explains Volker Burkert, Jefferson Lab Hall B Leader and a co-author on the paper."</em> <a href="https://www.jlab.org/node/7928">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers at Nagoya University find an inorganic semiconductor is brittle when exposed to light, but flexible in the dark Inorganic semiconductors such as silicon are indispensable in modern electronics because they possess tunable electrical conductivity between that of a metal and that of an insulator. The electrical conductivity of a semiconductor is controlled by its band gap, which is the energy difference between its valence and conduction bands; a narrow band gap results in increased conductivity because it is easier for an electron to move from the valence to the conduction band. However, inorganic semiconductors are brittle, which can lead to device failure and limits their application range, particularly in flexible electronics. A group at Nagoya University recently discovered that an inorganic semiconductor behaved differently in the dark compared with in the light. They found that crystals of zinc sulfide (ZnS), a representative inorganic semiconductor, were brittle when exposed to light but flexible when kept in the dark at room temperature. The findings were published in Science."</em> <a href="http://en.nagoya-u.ac.jp/research/activities/news/2018/05/keep-the-light-off-a-material-with-improved-mechanical-performance-in-the-dark.html">[...]</a>

Researchers at the University of Illinois applied a technique using 3D X-ray tomography of an electrode to better understand what is happening on the inside of a lithium ion battery and ultimately build batteries with more storage capacity and longer life. Put simply, when a lithium battery is being charged, lithium ions embed themselves into host particles that reside in the battery anode electrode and are stored there until needed to produce energy during the battery discharge.

That pioneering research, which won the 2014 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, has enabled researchers to track proteins in fertilized eggs, visualize how molecules form electrical connections between nerve cells in the brain, and study the nanoscale motion of miniature motors. Now, research developments at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) enable the microscopes to measure these nanometer-scale details with a new level of accuracy. “We put the optical microscope under a microscope to achieve accuracy near the atomic scale,” said NIST’s Samuel Stavis, who served as the project leader for these efforts. Because optical microscopes have not traditionally been used to study the nanometer scale, they typically lack the calibration—comparison to a standard to check that a result is correct—necessary to obtain information that is accurate at that scale.

Over the past decade, squeezing light into tiny devices and circuits has been a major goal of nanophotonics researchers. Electronic oscillations at the surface of metals, known as surface plasmon polaritons or plasmons for short, have become an intense area of focus. Plasmons are hybrids of light (photons) and electrons in a metal. If researchers can harness this nanolight, they will be able to improve sensing, subwavelength waveguiding, and optical transmission of signals.

Combined with nanoscale optical imaging, this scanning photocurrent microscopy technique provides a powerful tool for understanding the processes affecting the generation of electrical current (photocurrent) in these materials. Such an understanding is key to improving the performance of solar cells, optical sensors, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and other optoelectronics—electronic devices that rely on light-matter interactions to convert light into electrical signals or vice versa. “Anyone who wants to know how light-induced electrical current is distributed across a semiconductor will benefit from this capability,” said CFN materials scientist Mircea Cotlet, co-corresponding author on the May 17 Advanced Functional Materials paper describing the work.

Unlike normal computer bits, the qubit units used by quantum computers store information in two-state systems, such as electrons or photons, that are considered to be in all possible quantum states at once (a phenomenon known as superposition). “In classical computing, you write in bits of zero and one,” said Thomas Papenbrock, a theoretical nuclear physicist at the University of Tennessee and ORNL who co-led the project with ORNL quantum information specialist Pavel Lougovski. “But with a qubit, you can have zero, one, and any possible combination of zero and one, so you gain a vast set of possibilities to store data.” In October 2017 the multidivisional ORNL team started developing codes to perform simulations on the IBM QX5 and the Rigetti 19Q quantum computers through DOE’s Quantum Testbed Pathfinder project, an effort to verify and validate scientific applications on different quantum hardware types."</em> <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/news/nuclear-physicists-leap-quantum-computing-first-simulations-atomic-nucleus">[...]</a>

Liquid crystals undergo a peculiar type of phase change. At a certain temperature, their cigar-shaped molecules go from a disordered jumble to a more orderly arrangement in which they all point more or less in the same direction. LCD televisions take advantage of that phase change to project different colors in moving images. For years, however, experiments have hinted at another liquid crystal state — an intermediate state between the disordered and ordered states in which order begins to emerge in discrete patches as a system approaches its transition temperature. Now, chemists at Brown University have demonstrated a theoretical framework for detecting that intermediate state and for better understanding how it works."</em> <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2018/05/order">[...]</a>

Sorry to say that Dhaka has been ranked highest in the US Air Quality Index (AQI), for having the worst level of air pollution in the world. Noise also always goes far beyond the permissible level. Sound pollution has reached the highest 120-130 decibels (dB) at many points of the city -- almost double the permissible level."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/taifur/solar-powered-environmental-monitoring-kit-b1d03d">[...]</a>

Okay the constraints were: Used in conjunction with the HEADER JIG during soldering on the panels.Used after full assembly of the ICOS10 if needed.Reuse the IDC CABLE TESTER.Be able to run the continuity and isolation tests.The approach I took was: Have a simple IDC 6 wire cable from the IDC HEADER installed on the panel to one header on the IDC CABLE TESTER.Use a 1" Double sided protoboard to breakout 6 male pins, fitting the ASSIMILATE SENSOR BREAKOUT, and not obstructing use of the HEADER JIG. Also on the board is another IDC HEADER.Have a simple IDC 6 wire cable from the header on the protoboardl to the other header on the IDC CABLE TESTER.

<p><em>"There are a wide range of solutions on the market today to help the avid gardener with their plants, some are low tech battery-less meters designed to give you a simple view of how your plant is doing, others are much more high-tech (and expensive). Two of the most important variables to monitor in a greenhouse are temperature and humidity, too hot and plants start to scorch and wilt, too cold and they can be damaged, and humidity is important for a whole host of plants you may find in a greenhouse. At home I have a modest greenhouse, at 3 metres by 1.8 meters it has just enough room to start off delicate plants early and keep the family supplied throughout the season with chillies, tomatoes, cucumbers, strawberries, herbs, and even lemons. Although I can just barely make out the digital temperature gauge hanging on the inside of the greenhouse from my office window I thought is would be much better to have a more high-tech monitoring solution. After a bit of research I came across the Xiaomi Temperature and Humidity sensor which can be bought for as little as £9 from several Chinese online retailers. The sensor itself is a small, ZigBee-based device powered by a CR2032 button cell battery and capable of detecting temperatures from -20 to 60 celsius as well as humidity, perfect for this use case."</em> <a href="http://www.linuxuk.org/post/monitoring-plants-with-ubuntu/">[...]</a>

Perhaps the most interesting is a shift register based white noise generator, useful for drums, gunshots, explosions and other similar sound effects. The chip also uses a digital mixer to combine the chip's different sound generators. An unusual feature of the chip is that it uses Integrated Injection Logic (I2L), a type of digital logic developed in the 1970s with the goal of high-density, high-speed chips."</em> <a href="http://www.righto.com/2018/05/inside-76477-space-invaders-sound.html">[...]</a>

After I graduated from Arduino to ESP8266, my first project last year was also my most complex to date: detecting when a washer or dryer cycle has finished and sending a notification to my phone.

Altogether, between this and the part 1 instructable, the following topics are discussed/demonstrated: TopicATtiny84ATtiny85Serial Communication using the SoftwareSerial classX X Sharing device pins between application and downloadX X Pin Change interruptXExternal interruptXSleep in POWER_DOWN mode; wake on interruptXWork-around for the "multiply defined" interrupt vector link error related to SoftwareSerialX In-circuit modify, download, debug, ... development cycle for the ATtiny devicesX X Adding a hardware I/O component to one of the pins dedicated to the SPI programming interface is sometimes OK, sometimes not. For example, adding a LED to MISO just causes the LED to flicker during download and then it is available for the application. However, adding a piezo buzzer to MISO will result in a horrible screeching sound followed by download failure. This instructable explains how to use a 4x2:1 multiplexer to "recover" use of the pins assigned to the SPI interface MISO, MOSI, and SCK signals by protecting them during download. Reuse of the RESET pin requires a fuse change and is not covered by this approach."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/ATtiny8485-SPI-Interface-Pin-Reuse/">[...]</a>

This project describes a technique of measuring the heart rate through a fingertip using a PIC microcontroller. While the heart is beating, it is actually pumping blood throughout the body, and that makes the blood volume inside the finger artery to change too. This fluctuation of blood can be detected through an optical sensing mechanism placed around the fingertip. The signal can be amplified further for the microcontroller to count the rate of fluctuation, which is actually the heart rate. Update: For those who are interested to replicate this project, you can use Easy Pulse sensor that covers the complete sensor and instrumentation part."</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Microcontroller-measures-heart-rate-through-finger/">[...]</a>
