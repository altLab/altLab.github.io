<p>Faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1586, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_Zucchi">Niccolò Zucchi</a>. Este astrónomo italiano projectou um dos primeiros telescópios reflectores, anteriores aos de James Gregory e Sir Isaac Newton. Como professor do Colégio dos Jesuítas em Roma, Zucchi desenvolveu um interesse pela astronomia a partir de uma reunião com Johannes Kepler. Com este telescópio, Zucchi descobriu os cinturões do planeta Júpiter (1630) e examinou os pontos em Marte (1640). Ele também demonstrou (em 1652) que os fósforos geram em vez de armazenar luz. O seu livro "Optica philosophia experimentalis et ratione a fundamentis constituta" (1652-56) inspirou Gregory e Newton a construir telescópios melhorados.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1778, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Louis_Gay-Lussac">Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac</a>. Este Químico francês é mais conhecido pelo seu trabalho em gases. Em 1805, ao fazer explodir juntos volumes específicos de hidrogénio e oxigénio, Gay-Lussac descobriu que eles combinaram na proporção de 2: 1 em volume para formar água. Em 1808, depois de pesquisas usando outros gases, ele formulou sua famosa lei de combinar volumes - que quando os gases combinam seus volumes relativos possuem uma relação numérica simples entre si (por exemplo, 1: 1, 2: 1) e seu produto gasoso ( sob pressão e temperatura constantes). Ele desenvolveu técnicas de análise química quantitativa, confirmou que o iodo era um elemento, descobriu o cianogénio, melhorou o processo de fabricação de ácido sulfúrico, preparado de potássio e boro (1808).</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1835, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Rudolph_Fittig">Wilhelm Rudolph Fittig</a>. Este Químico orgânico alemão é famoso pelo seu extenso trabalho de sintetizar compostos orgânicos no final do século XIX. A acção do sódio em compostos orgânicos descobertos por Wurtz (1817-84), foi estendida por Fittig usando uma mistura de um aromático e alquil halóide para produzir homólogos de benzeno. Fittig preparou pinacones (que ele denominou), difenil, fenantreno (1872), cumarona (1883), tolueno (com Tollens em 1864) e muitas outras substâncias. Ele separou vários compostos aromáticos do alcatrão de carvão, estudou as reacções de ácidos insaturados. Fittig propôs as estruturas corretas para as quinonas e (1871, com Ira Remsen) para a piperina alcalóide que dá ao tempero pimenta preta seu sabor e cheiro.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1863, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Martin_Hall">Charles Martin Hall</a>. Este Químico americano inventou o método electrolítico barato de extrair alumínio do seu minério, permitindo o amplo uso comercial deste metal. Enquanto jovem químico, ele experimentou num abrigo de madeira, com a intenção de encontrar um método para separar o alumínio do seu minério. No início, ele não teve sucesso, mas depois percebeu que precisava de um solvente não aquoso para o óxido de alumínio durante a electrólise. Em 23 de Fevereiro de 1886, Hall descobriu que a criolita fundida (o fluoreto de alumínio e sódio mineral) era um solvente adequado e, usando eléctrodos de carbono com baterias caseiras, produziu os seus primeiros pequenos glóbulos de alumínio. Em 1914, o processo de Hall tinha baixado o custo do alumínio, anteriormente um metal precioso usado para jóias finas, para 18 centavos de dólar por libra-peso.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1900, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Uhlenbeck">George Uhlenbeck</a>. Este Físico holandês-americano que, com Samuel A. Goudsmit, propôs o conceito da rotação do electrão (Jan 1925) que era um meio inteiro. Isto forneceu o “quarto número quântico” antecipado por Wolfgang Pauli. Na sua experiência, um feixe horizontal de átomos de prata deslocando-se através de um campo magnético vertical foi deflectido em duas direcções de acordo com a interacção da sua rotação (subida ou descida) com o campo magnético. Esta foi a primeira demonstração desse efeito quântico e uma confirmação precoce da teoria quântica. Além do trabalho fundamental sobre mecânica quântica, Uhlenbeck trabalhou na estrutura atómica, na teoria cinética da matéria e ampliou a equação de Boltzmann para gases densos.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1920, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Porter">George Porter</a>. Este químico inglês, recebeu uma parte do Prémio Nobel da Química de 1967, com o inglês Ronald Norrish e o alemão Manfred Eigen, "pelos seus estudos de reações químicas extremamente rápidas, afretado por perturbar o equilíbrio por meio de pulsos de energia muito curtos". Porter mostrou como o método de fotólise por flash - uma técnica para observar os estágios intermediários de reacções químicas muito rápidas - pode ser estendido e aplicado a muitos problemas diversos de física, química e biologia. Um exemplo é o exame da fotossíntese. Ele estendeu essas técnicas para as regiões de nano-segundos e pico-segundos.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que a reparação da câmara do Hubble fez 25 anos. A NASA manteve sua respiração quando sete astronautas do vaivém espacial Endeavour alcançaram o Telescópio Espacial Hubble a 568 quilómetros da Terra. A sua missão: reparar uma falha devastadora no espelho primário do telescópio. Com o tamanho de um autocarro escolar, o Telescópio Espacial Hubble tem um espelho primário de 2,4 metros. O maior telescópio óptico já lançado ao espaço, onde podia observar o universo livre dos efeitos distorcidos da atmosfera da Terra, o Hubble tinha muito a seu redor. Mas depois das primeiras imagens recebidas e cuidadosamente analisadas após a implantação do telescópio em 25 de Abril de 1990, ficou claro que algo estava errado: as imagens estavam turvas.</p>

<p>Também esta semana ficámos a saber que depois de 26 sucessos sequenciais, a SpaceX não conseguiu pousar Falcon 9. É o primeiro acidente desde 2016. No entanto a carga composta por mais de sessenta e quatro satélites foi colocada em orbita com sucesso. E foram batidos pelo menos quatro recordes, o recorde americano para colocação de mais satélites, o maior numero de lançamentos num ano (19). O lançador (booster) designado por B1046 foi lançado pela terceira vez e nas três plataformas de lançamento disponíveis - no pad 39A do Kennedy Space Center, no complexo de lançamento 40 no Cabo Canaveral, e agora no complexo de lançamento 4E na Base aérea de Vandenberg na California.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como um modelo 3D que poderá ser útil.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7297">The 'Camera That Saved Hubble' Turns 25</a></h2>

<p><em>"Twenty-five years ago this week, NASA held its collective breath as seven astronauts on space shuttle Endeavour caught up with the Hubble Space Telescope 353 miles (568 kilometers) above Earth. Their mission: to fix a devastating flaw in the telescope's primary mirror. About the size of a school bus, the Hubble Space Telescope has an 8-foot (2.4-meter) primary mirror. The largest optical telescope ever launched into space, where it could observe the universe free from the distorting effects of Earth's atmosphere, Hubble had a lot riding on it. But after the first images were obtained and carefully analyzed following the telescope's deployment on April 25, 1990, it was clear that something was wrong: The images were blurry. Astronomers and engineers rallied to study a variety of solutions to the problem, and NASA convened an independent committee to find the source."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7297">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Something unexpected happened after the launch of a Falcon 9 rocket to the International Space Station—the first-stage booster did not come back to Earth as intended. Instead, it made an unscheduled landing in the Atlantic Ocean, just off the Florida coast. At about 7 minutes and 25 seconds after the launch, the first stage began spinning out of control as it descended back toward Kennedy Space Center along the Florida coast. There was a problem with one of the grid fins that are used to stabilize the first stage during its return to Earth through the thickening atmosphere. "Grid fin hydraulic pump stalled, so Falcon landed just out to sea," SpaceX founder and lead designer Elon Musk tweeted shortly after the rocket landed. "Appears to be undamaged &amp; is transmitting data."</em> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/12/after-26-straight-successes-spacex-fails-to-land-a-rocket-it-wanted-back/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"New images from NASA's Mars InSight lander show its robotic arm is ready to do some lifting. With a reach of nearly 6 feet (2 meters), the arm will be used to pick up science instruments from the lander's deck, gently setting them on the Martian surface at Elysium Planitia, the lava plain where InSight touched down on Nov. 26. But first, the arm will use its Instrument Deployment Camera, located on its elbow, to take photos of the terrain in front of the lander. These images will help mission team members determine where to set InSight's seismometer and heat flow probe - the only instruments ever to be robotically placed on the surface of another planet. "Today we can see the first glimpses of our workspace," said Bruce Banerdt, the mission's principal investigator at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. "By early next week, we'll be imaging it in finer detail and creating a full mosaic.""</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7298">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.allegromicro.com/en/About-Allegro/News-Room/2018/APS11700-60-Press-Release.aspx">Rugged Micropower Magnetic Sensor ICs Maximize Battery Life, Improve System Efficiency</a></h2>

<p><em>"Allegro MicroSystems has announced the release of a family of Micropower Hall-effect switch ICs—the APS11700 and APS11760—designed specifically for battery powered applications in harsh industrial and automotive environments. Automatic power management enables average supply current as low as 6µA while operating directly from a vehicle battery or other unregulated supply. The power management happens in the background and is transparent to the host system, making them a drop-in upgrade for existing Hall-effect switches or a solid-state replacement for mechanical microswitches or reed switches. "Thanks to the APS11700/760’s unique combination of ruggedness and ultra-low power, there is finally a reliable, solid-state upgrade for reed and microswitches, even in the most power-sensitive applications where the sensor will be connected directly to the battery," explains Jim Judkins, Product Line Director for Allegro's Position Sensor ICs. These monolithic devices include either a standard Hall plate or a vertical Hall plate, a small-signal amplifier, chopper stabilization, a Schmitt trigger, automatic power management controller, and an NMOS output transistor. The APS11700 uses a standard planar Hall-effect sensing element, while the APS11760 implements AVHT technology in the form of a silicon-based vertical Hall-effect sensing element."</em> <a href="https://www.allegromicro.com/en/About-Allegro/News-Room/2018/APS11700-60-Press-Release.aspx">[...]</a>

It’s foundational for so many different things that we’ve decided to provide it to the world in an open source fashion. Meanwhile, we’re building on more than a decade of continuous investment in this area to simulate the world with ever greater fidelity, with ongoing research and development to meet the needs of those working in robotics and with autonomous vehicles. Free, Open-Source, GPU-Accelerated PhysX will now be the only free, open-source physics solution that takes advantage of GPU acceleration and can handle large virtual environments."</em> <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2018/12/03/physx-high-fidelity-open-source/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In an article published online today in Science Advances, a team of scientists from Arizona State University's School of Molecular Sciences and Germany offer an explanation of how a particular phase-change memory (PCM) material can work a thousand times faster than current flash computer memory, while being significantly more durable with respect to the number of daily read-writes. PCMs are a form of computer random-access memory (RAM) that store data by altering the state of the matter of the “bits” (millions of which make up the device) between liquid, glass and crystal states. PCM technology has the potential to provide inexpensive, high-speed, high-density, high-volume, nonvolatile storage on an unprecedented scale. The basic idea and material were invented by Stanford Ovshinsky in 1975, but applications have lingered due to lack of clarity about how the material can execute the phase changes on such short time scales and technical problems related to controlling the changes with necessary precision. Now high tech companies like Samsung, IBM and Intel are racing to perfect it. The semimetallic material under current study is an alloy of germanium, antimony and tellurium in the ratio of 1:2:4."</em> <a href="https://asunow.asu.edu/20181130-new-light-significantly-faster-computer-memory-devices">[...]</a>

Currently, wearable electronics are achieved by essentially gluing devices to fabrics, which can mean they are too rigid and susceptible to malfunctioning. The new research instead integrates the electronic devices into the fabric of the material, by coating electronic fibres with light-weight, durable components that will allow images to be shown directly on the fabric. The research team believe that the discovery could revolutionise the creation of wearable electronic devices for use in a range of every day applications, as well as health monitoring, such as heart rates and blood pressure, and medical diagnostics.

<p><em>"Real-time imaging has shown the surprising flexibility of a crystal surface upon guest molecule introduction, with implications for storage and sensing devices Images taken using an atomic force microscope have allowed researchers to observe, for the first time, the flexible and dynamic changes that occur on the surfaces of 'porous coordination polymer' crystals when guest molecules are introduced. The findings, published in the journal Nature Chemistry, have implications for investigations into materials that can be used for storing and sensing molecules. "We were surprised to find that the porous coordination polymer surface is exceptionally flexible and constantly fluctuating in solution," says Nobuhiko Hosono of Kyoto University's Institute for Integrated Cell-Material Sciences (iCeMS), "on the contrary to the common perception that the crystal is hard and immobile." Porous coordination polymers are crystalline materials that form by the self-assembly of metal ions and organic binding molecules called ligands. They are currently being investigated by materials scientists due to their ability to change their structure when other molecules are introduced to them or when they are exposed to certain external stimuli, without losing their crystallinity.

Both of these languages support digital I/O in/out, analog inputs, serial buses, and, most key to the nRF52840, support for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). We’ll be mostly focusing on using these programming tools on the SparkFun Pro nRF52840 Mini, but any other nRF52840 should be adaptable. The only caveat is the Adafruit nRF52840 Bootloader should be installed on the nRF52840."</em> <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/nrf52840-development-with-arduino-and-circuitpython/all">[...]</a>

To allow the connection of sensors and the pHAT to the GPIO of the Pi I placed a Pimorini Pico HAT hacker with two female headers attached between the GPIO and the display. The device has been used to attach several sensors, so the BME280 version described here is just an example. Unlike LCD displays, e-ink displays keep the image even if power has been switched off. Therefore they are a very good solution if you want to display information that is updated just from time to time, especially to build low energy devices.

<p><em>"The "Breathing Exercise Light" described here is a simple and relatively inexpensive pulsing light that may support you in your breathing execises and help you to keep a constant breathing rhythm. It could also be used e.g. as a soothing night light for children. In the current stage, it is hardly more than a working prototype. But you may also see it as an inexpensive and simple to build example for "physical computing" with a Raspberry Pi, and it might be used as a educational project on the beginners level. It is based on the Firefly Light example by Pimoroni (see here)."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/A-Breathing-Light-Controlled-by-a-Raspberry-Pi/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Introduction The Arduino IDE (integrated development environment) is great at achieving its intended purpose: It’s a simple, single-file application development environment. It has just enough integrated tools to help achieve that purpose. But for larger application development – whether you’re designing Arduino libraries or developing new Arduino cores – it doesn’t compare with a full-featured C/C++ IDE. The Arduino IDE lacks a number of “professional” code-assistance features, like: Code navigation – Whether it’s find-by-reference (instantly navigating to the definition of the function you’re using), search-by-symbol (quick navigation to function or symbol definitions within a file), or a quick link to a compilation error, code navigation is critical to managing large code bases. Auto-Complete – This feature can, of course, help complete long constant names, but it can also provide insight into the parameters that a function may expect. Version control integration – Whether you’re using git or SVN, many modern IDE’s provide source-control integration that can show, line-by-line, the changes you’ve made since your last commit."</em> <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/efficient-arduino-programming-with-arduino-cli-and-visual-studio-code/all">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Welcome to my latest instructable to build a self contained information station! This awesome device uses an Arduino Uno with an ethernet shield to connect to the internet and pull down latest news and local weather and display it on an LCD display. This project is relitavely inexpensive and has many options for expansion and further work. You can just build the whole thing out on breadboard but if you want to use a nice clean housing there is some soldering required.. So lets get started with the list of components that you will need: 1 Arduino Uno 1 Ethernet Shield. (I use the hanran shield here) 1 4x20 LCD display like this one."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Information-Station-Arduino/">[...]</a>
