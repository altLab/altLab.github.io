<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1858, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihajlo_Pupin">Mihajlo Pupin</a>. Este Físico americano-sérvio desenvolveu um mecanismo de ampliar enormemente o alcance da comunicação telefónica de longa distância, colocando bobines de carregamento (de arame) em intervalos predeterminados ao longo do fio transmissor. Pupin tornou-se instrutor de física matemática (1890) na Columbia University, em Nova York. Em 1986, ele descobriu que os átomos atingidos pelos raios X emitem radiação de raios X secundária. Ele também inventou uma forma de tirar fotografias de raio X de curta exposição. A Bell Telephone Company, em 1901, adquiriu a patente de sua invenção para telefonia de longa distância. Pupin ganhou um Prémio Pulitzer (1924) pelo seu trabalho autobiográfico, From Immigrant to Inventor (1923).</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1903, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Stanley_Smith">Cyril Stanley Smith</a>. Este Metalúrgico britânico-americano determinou em 1943-44 as propriedades e a tecnologia do plutónio e do urânio, os materiais essenciais nas bombas atómicas que explodiram pela primeira vez em 1945. Smith já tinha então 15 anos de experiência como investigador metalúrgico da American Brass Co. ., durante o qual ele estudou propriedades de ligas e sua micro-estrutura. Na Segunda Guerra Mundial, ele juntou-se ao Laboratório Los Alamos no seu início (1943). As propriedades e tecnologia do plutónio tinham que ser conduzidas com quantidades extremamente limitadas de material disponível. Smith e seu grupo descobriram que era único, com cinco formas alotrópicas diferentes, com enormes diferenças de densidade entre elas.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1903, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Vincent_Atanasoff">John Vincent Atanasoff</a>. Este físico americano foi oficialmente mas tardiamente conhecido pelo desenvolvimento do primeiro computador digital electrónico. Construído em 1937-42 na Universidade do Estado de Iowa por Atanasoff e um estudante de pós-graduação, Clifford Berry, introduziu as ideias de aritmética binária, memória regenerativa e circuitos lógicos. Essas ideias foram comunicadas de Atanasoff a John Mauchly, que as utilizou no projecto do mais conhecido ENIAC, construído e patenteado vários anos depois. Em 19 de outubro de 1973, um juiz federal dos EUA assinou sua decisão após um longo julgamento no tribunal que declarou a patente do ENIAC inválida e nomeou Atanasoff como o inventor original do computador digital electrónico, o Atanasoff-Berry Computer ou ABC.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1916, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitaly_Ginzburg">Vitaly Ginzburg</a>. Este Físico soviético e astrofísico ficou conhecido pela sua pesquisa sobre a teoria da supercondutividade e a teoria dos processos de alta energia na astrofísica, teorias da propagação de ondas electromagnéticas em plasmas, radioastronomia e a origem dos raios cósmicos. Ele ajudou a desenvolver a bomba de hidrogénio soviética. Em 2003, Ginzburg dividiu o Prémio Nobel de Física (com Alexei A. Abrikosov e Anthony J. Leggett) por “contribuições pioneiras à teoria dos super-condutores e super-fluidos.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1918, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenichi_Fukui">Kenichi Fukui</a>. Este Químico japonês partilhou o Prémio Nobel de Química de 1981 com Roald Hoffmann pela investigação dos mecanismos das reacções químicas. Em 1952, na Universidade de Kyoto, Fukui introduziu sua “teoria de reacções orbitais de fronteira”. Ele propôs que a evolução de uma reacção é determinado pela geometria e energias relativas de orbitais moleculares de reagentes. A teoria explica o ataque electrolítico, por exemplo, que ocorre no átomo de carbono com a maior densidade de electrões de fronteira (energia mais alta). Em meados da década de 1960, Fukui e Hoffmann descobriram - quase simultaneamente e independentemente um  do outro - que as propriedades de simetria dos orbitais de fronteira poderiam explicar certos cursos de reacção que antes eram difíceis de entender.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1924, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Karnaugh">Maurice Karnaugh</a>. Este físico norte-americano ficou conhecido na historia por ter criado os mapas de Karnaugh. O mapa de Karnaugh (KM ou K-map) é um método de simplificação das expressões de álgebra booleana.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que existem fortes indícios que espiões chineses conseguiram infiltrar-se em mais de 30 companhias de tecnologia norte-americanas através da colocação de um chip nas motherboards dos servidores usados por estas companhias. As motherboards foram fabricadas na china pela Supermicro e os chips foram implantados em fabricas que forneciam a Supermicro. Posteriormente quando um servidor era instalado e ligado, o chip alterava o núcleo do sistema operativo para aceitar modificações. O chip também poderia entrar em contacto com computadores controlados pelos espiões em busca de mais ordens e/ou código mais recente.</p>

<p>Também esta semana a Wi-Fi Alliance introduziu o Wi-Fi 6. A Wi-Fi Alliance apresenta o Wi-Fi 6 como a designação da indústria para produtos e redes que suportam a próxima geração de Wi-Fi®, com base na tecnologia 802.11ax. O Wi-Fi 6 faz parte de uma nova abordagem de nomenclatura da Wi-Fi Alliance, que fornece aos utilizadores uma designação de fácil compreensão para a tecnologia Wi-Fi suportada pelo seu dispositivo e usada numa ligação que o dispositivo faz com uma rede Wi-Fi. O novo sistema de nomeação identifica as gerações de Wi-Fi por uma sequência numérica que corresponde aos principais avanços no Wi-Fi. Os nomes de geração podem ser usados por fornecedores de produtos para identificar a tecnologia Wi-Fi mais recente que um dispositivo suporta, por fornecedores de SO para identificar a geração de conexão Wi-Fi entre um dispositivo e a rede e por provedores de serviço para identificar os recursos de uma rede Wi-Fi para seus clientes.</p>

<p>Também esta semana a NASA anunciou que vai proceder ao "Switch" temporário dos 'Brains' do rover Curiosity. Engenheiros do Laboratório de Propulsão a Jato da NASA em Pasadena, Califórnia, nesta semana, ordenaram que o rover Curiosity da agência mudasse para seu segundo computador. A troca permitirá que os engenheiros façam um diagnóstico detalhado de um problema técnico que impediu que o computador activo do rover armazene informação e alguns dados importantes de engenharia desde 15 de Setembro.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker.

<p><em>"The attack by Chinese spies reached almost 30 U.S. companies, including Amazon and Apple, by compromising America’s technology supply chain, according to extensive interviews with government and corporate sources. In 2015, Amazon.com Inc. began quietly evaluating a startup called Elemental Technologies, a potential acquisition to help with a major expansion of its streaming video service, known today as Amazon Prime Video. Based in Portland, Ore., Elemental made software for compressing massive video files and formatting them for different devices. Its technology had helped stream the Olympic Games online, communicate with the International Space Station, and funnel drone footage to the Central Intelligence Agency. Elemental’s national security contracts weren’t the main reason for the proposed acquisition, but they fit nicely with Amazon’s government businesses, such as the highly secure cloud that Amazon Web Services (AWS) was building for the CIA. To help with due diligence, AWS, which was overseeing the prospective acquisition, hired a third-party company to scrutinize Elemental’s security, according to one person familiar with the process."</em> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.wi-fi.org/news-events/newsroom/wi-fi-alliance-introduces-wi-fi-6">Wi-Fi Alliance introduces Wi-Fi 6</a></h2>

<p><em>"New generational approach enables users to easily differentiate between Wi-Fi® technologies Wi-Fi Alliance® introduces Wi-Fi 6 as the industry designation for products and networks that support the next generation of Wi-Fi®, based on 802.11ax technology. Wi-Fi 6 is part of a new naming approach by Wi-Fi Alliance that provides users with an easy-to-understand designation for both the Wi-Fi technology supported by their device and used in a connection the device makes with a Wi-Fi network. The new naming system identifies Wi-Fi generations by a numerical sequence which correspond to major advancements in Wi-Fi. The generation names can be used by product vendors to identify the latest Wi-Fi technology a device supports, by OS vendors to identify the generation of Wi-Fi connection between a device and network, and by service providers to identify the capabilities of a Wi-Fi network to their customers. The generational terminology may also be used to designate previous Wi-Fi generations, such as 802.11n or 802.11ac. The numerical sequence includes: Wi-Fi 6 to identify devices that support 802.11ax technology Wi-Fi 5 to identify devices that support 802.11ac technology Wi-Fi 4 to identify devices that support 802.11n technology Each generation of Wi-Fi offers new features – faster speeds, increased throughput, and better experiences."</em> <a href="https://www.wi-fi.org/news-events/newsroom/wi-fi-alliance-introduces-wi-fi-6">[...]</a>

<p><em>"NASA Curiosity Mission Status Report Engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, this week commanded the agency's Curiosity rover to switch to its second computer. The switch will enable engineers to do a detailed diagnosis of a technical issue that has prevented the rover's active computer from storing science and some key engineering data since Sept. 15. Like many NASA spacecraft, Curiosity was designed with two, redundant computers -- in this case, referred to as a Side-A and a Side-B computer -- so that it can continue operations if one experiences a glitch. After reviewing several options, JPL engineers recommended that the rover switch from Side B to Side A, the computer the rover used initially after landing. The rover continues to send limited engineering data stored in short-term memory when it connects to a relay orbiter. It is otherwise healthy and receiving commands."</em> <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8371/curiosity-rover-to-temporarily-switch-brains/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A new, full-size Hyperloop capsule designed to carry passengers at 1,000 kilometers per hour (620 mph) was unveiled Tuesday, offering a glimpse at what could be the future of travel. Hyperloop is the megafast, cutting edge transport technology first envisaged by controversial business magnate Elon Musk. It's designed to transport people through low-pressure steel tubes at speeds to match a typical passenger aircraft. Several companies are now competing to be the first to make the Hyperloop concept a reality. Hyperloop Transportation Technologies, a US start-up with no connections to Musk, hopes its new full-size prototype capsule puts it ahead in the game. The sleek capsule was unveiled Puerto de Santa Maria, Spain, near where it was constructed at the aerospace facilities of Airtificial, a partner of HyperloopTT."</em> <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/hyperloop-capsule/index.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Today, 3-D printing generates parts used in ships, planes, vehicles and spacecraft, but it also requires a lot of babysitting. High-value and intricate parts sometimes require constant monitoring by expert specialists to get them right. Furthermore, if any one section of a part is below par, it can render the whole part unusable. That's why Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) and the Office of Naval Research are exploring how to apply artificial intelligence to train robots to independently oversee—and optimize—3-D printing of complex parts. The two-year, $5.8 million contract specifically studies and will customize multi-axis robots that use laser beams to deposit material. The team led by Lockheed Martin's Advanced Technology Center will develop software models and sensor modifications for the robots to build better components."</em> <a href="https://news.lockheedmartin.com/2018-10-01-Lockheed-Martin-Contract-to-Marry-Machine-Learning-with-3-D-Printing-for-More-Reliable-Parts#assets_all#assets_all">[...]</a>

But they do know it's some sort of cosmic ray — a high-energy particle that's blasted its way through space, into the Earth, and back out again. But the particles physicists know about — the collection of particles that make up what scientists call the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics — shouldn't be able to do that.

<h2><a href="https://www.space.com/41995-dwarf-planet-the-goblin-discovery-planet-nine.html">Newfound Dwarf Planet 'The Goblin' May Lead to Mysterious Planet Nine</a></h2>

<p><em>"Scientists have discovered yet another marker on the trail toward the putative Planet Nine. That clue is 2015 TG387, a newfound object in the far outer solar system, way beyond Pluto. The orbit of 2015 TG387 shares peculiarities with those of other extremely far-flung bodies, which appear to have been shaped by the gravity of a very large object in that distant, frigid realm — the hypothesized Planet Nine, also known as Planet X. "These distant objects are like breadcrumbs leading us to Planet X," study leader Scott Sheppard, of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C., said in a statement. [The Evidence for 'Planet Nine' in Our Solar System (Gallery)] "The more of them we can find, the better we can understand the outer solar system and the possible planet that we think is shaping their orbits — a discovery that would redefine our knowledge of the solar system's evolution," he added. And 2015 TG387 is special among these bread crumbs, because it was found during a relatively uniform survey of the northern and southern skies rather than a targeted hunt for clustered objects in certain parts of the sky, Sheppard said."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/41995-dwarf-planet-the-goblin-discovery-planet-nine.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Computers in the future could be more energy-efficient, thanks to new research from Binghamton University, State University at New York. Devices like drones depend on a constant WiFi signal – if the WiFi stops, the drone crashes. Louis Piper, associate professor of physics and director of materials science and engineering at Binghamton University, wants to make more energy-efficient computers, so things like drones could be responsive to their environment without worrying about a WiFi signal linking it to a larger computer machine. “You could put 5G and 6G everywhere and assume that you have a reliable internet connection all the time, or you could address the problem with hardware processing, which is what we’re doing,” said Piper. “The idea is we want to have these chips that can do all the functioning in the chip, rather than messages back and forth with some sort of large server. It should be more efficient that way.” Scientists have developed “neuristor” circuits that behave similarly to biological neurons in the human brain, which can perform complex computations using an incredibly small amount of power."</em> <a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/news/story/1356/new-research-could-lead-to-more-energy-efficient-computing">[...]</a>

The team is now building a version that is capable of charging vehicles more quickly, while also charging multiple vehicles at the same time. The new technology is called a medium voltage fast charger (MVFC). Conventional, 50 kilowatt (kW) state-of-the-art chargers include a distribution transformer, which weighs 1000 kilograms, and a separate fast charger unit, which weighs 200 to 600 kg. To support the weight, this transformer-and-charger system usually needs to be installed on a concrete slab. The transformer takes power from a utility medium-voltage line line and steps down the voltage to 480 V so that it that can be used by the fast charger."</em> <a href="https://news.ncsu.edu/2018/10/better-fast-charger/">[...]</a>

However, it is brittle and has poor mechanical stability, so it is often modified by adding reinforcing polymers and by incorporating different polymerization methods. Unfortunately, these modifications also reduce the material's strength and elastic modulus, which limits its applications. Now, Chaobin He, Beng Hoon Tan and colleagues at the A*STAR Institute of Materials Research and Engineering, Singapore, report the increased toughness of PLA, while maintaining the strength and modulus of the material, by the addition of core-shell nanoparticles as a filler.

<h2><a href="http://www.righto.com/2018/09/two-bits-per-transistor-high-density.html">Two bits per transistor: high-density ROM in Intel's 8087 floating point chip</a></h2>

<p><em>"The 8087 chip provided fast floating point arithmetic for the original IBM PC and became part of the x86 architecture used today. One unusual feature of the 8087 is it contained a multi-level ROM (Read-Only Memory) that stored two bits per transistor, twice as dense as a normal ROM. Instead of storing binary data, each cell in the 8087's ROM stored one of four different values, which were then decoded into two bits. Because the 8087 required a large ROM for microcode1 and the chip was pushing the limits of how many transistors could fit on a chip, Intel used this special technique to make the ROM fit. In this article, I explain how Intel implemented this multi-level ROM. Intel introduced the 8087 chip in 1980 to improve floating-point performance on the 8086 and 8088 processors."</em> <a href="http://www.righto.com/2018/09/two-bits-per-transistor-high-density.html">[...]</a>

I have zener diodes that are higher than 30V, which makes the lab supply useless, and filament LEDs with forward voltage over 60V. When I need to test them quickly, I used to hook up a simple rectifier circuit to a variable AC power supply (nothing more than a slidac with isolation transformer). While this gets job done, the setup is capable of supplying much too high current (1A or more), so I was always very nervous and extra careful in handling the circuit. All I need is a little HV generator that gives me around 200V DC and only capable of supplying a milliamp or less.

If you need to do any other significant processing there's a chance that the GPS handling may interfere with your other tasks. Providing the GPS processing as a separate I2C module solves this problem.

If we connect the sensor to 5V power and at the same time to 3.3V pins, the Echo pin's output will also be 5V and will most likely destroy the 3.3V pins of our microcontroller board.
