<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1787, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_L._Stevens">Robert Livingston Stevens</a>. Este engenheiro norte-americano e projectista de navios inventou o carril ferroviário T invertido e o espigão de fixação ferroviário. Ele descobriu que os trilhos colocados em barrotes de madeira, com brita ou cascalho por baixo, proporcionavam uma estrada superior a qualquer outra conhecida anteriormente. Ele também adicionou o piloto - objecto em forma de V para desviar obstáculos da linha - à locomotiva, e aumentou o número de rodas motrizes para oito para melhor tracção.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1799, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Friedrich_Sch%C3%B6nbein">Christian Friedrich Schönbein</a>. Este Químico germano-suíço descobriu e deu nome ao ozónio (1840) e foi o primeiro a descrever o guncotton (nitro-celulose). Ele notou que o ozónio aparecia durante tempestades e chamou ao ozónio o gás pelo seu cheiro peculiar (ozo é grego para o olfacto). Experiências posteriores mostraram que o envio de uma corrente eléctrica através de oxigénio puro e seco (O2) cria ozónio (O3). A sua descoberta do poderoso explosivo chamado nitrato de celulose, ou arma de algodão, foi o resultado de um acidente de laboratório. Um dia, em 1845, derramou ácido sulfúrico e nítrico e encharcou-o com um avental de algodão. Depois que o avental secou, ele explodiu em chamas - ele tinha criado a celulose nitrada. Ele descobriu que o nitrato de celulose podia ser moldado e tinha algumas propriedades elásticas. Eventualmente foi usado para pólvora sem fumo.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1902, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascual_Jordan">Pascual Jordan</a>. Este físico alemão no final dos anos 1920 co-fundou (com Max Born e depois Werner Heisenberg) a mecânica quântica usando métodos matriciais, mostrando como a luz poderia ser interpretada como composta de quantum de energia. Mais tarde, (com Wolfgang Pauli e Eugene Wigner), enquanto ainda estava nos seus estágios iniciais de desenvolvimento, ele contribuiu para as mecânicas quânticas de interacções electrão-fotão, agora chamadas de electrodinâmica quântica. Ele também originou (concomitantemente com Robert Dicke) uma teoria da cosmologia que propunha fazer as constantes universais da natureza (como a constante gravitacional universal G), variável ao longo do tempo.</p>

<p>Foi hoje lançado o mais recente sistema da Canonical o Ubuntu 18.10. Este sistema encontra-se focado em ambientes multi-cloud, desenvolvimento de software de Inteligência Artificial, traz um novo tema de ambiente de trabalho comunitário e uma integração mais afinada com os SNAPs. Este sistema usa o GNOME 3.30 e o Kernel Linux 4.18. Outros destaques incluem o suporte VeraCrypt no GNOME Disks, efeitos suaves de visualização e zoom de desktop, suporte para desbloquear o seu PC com impressões digitais, melhor suporte Snap, integração de telefone móvel com GS Connect, assim como suporte para a gestão de dispositivos Thunderbolt no painel de configurações. Na base do sistema foram actualizadas as ferramentas de desenvolvimento que consistem em GNU C Library (Glibc) 2.28, GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) 8.2, OpenSSL 1.1.1, Python 3.6.7 (padrão) e 3.7.1, Boost 1.67, Ruby 2.5.1, Perl 5.26.2, PHP 7.2.10, Golang 1.10.4, Rust 1.28 e OpenJDK 11.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. É apresentada a revista Hackspace Nº12 e o Volume 4 do "The Official Raspberry PI Projects Book".</p>

<p><em>"TSMC taped out its first chip in a process making limited use of extreme ultraviolet lithography and will start risk production in April on a 5-nm node with full EUV. Separately, the foundry forged partnerships with four partners to support online services for back-end chip design. The foundry’s update showed that area and power gains continue in its leading-edge nodes, but chip speeds are no longer advancing at their historic rate. To compensate, TSMC gave an update on a half-dozen packaging techniques that it is developing to speed connections between chips. Backers say that cloud-based services will shorten the time and extend the reach of chip design tools, helping expand a semiconductor industry facing the slowdown of Moore’s Law. However, they note that cloud design is still in an early phase that typically requires setting up and optimizing custom sites."</em> <a href="https://www.eetasia.com/news/article/18100502-tsmc-to-start-5nm-production-in-april">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/about/media-center/press-item.html/p4087.html">STMicroelectronics Introduces STM32L5 Ultra-Low-Power Microcontrollers for a More Secured IoT</a></h2>

<p><em>"STMicroelectronics, a global semiconductor leader serving customers across the spectrum of electronics applications, is bringing sophisticated cyber-protection to power-conscious connected devices with the new STM32L5 microcontroller (MCU) series featuring the Arm® Cortex® -M33 core. Building on the Cortex-M33, which boosts protection for small devices by integrating Arm’s TrustZone® hardware-based security, ST’s STM32L5-series MCUs add further enhancements including flexible software isolation, secure boot, key storage, and hardware cryptographic accelerators. They also provide rich functionality, high performance, and long run-times powered by coin cells or energy harvesting. Consuming as little as 33nA in shutdown mode and achieving 402 ULPMark-CP in the EEMBC[1] ULPBench, the new MCU series builds on the Company’s expertise in low-power techniques such as adaptive voltage scaling, real-time acceleration, power gating, and multiple reduced-power operating modes proven in previous STM32L series. “The STM32L5 series with TrustZone and additional custom protection features considerably strengthens and hardens cyber-protection for small IoT devices,” said Ricardo De Sa Earp, Microcontroller Division General Manager, STMicroelectronics. “Also featuring our unique energy-saving technologies, rich connectivity, and smart digital and analog peripherals, these devices will be the first choice to host cutting-edge connected applications.” With extensive integrated digital and analog peripherals, and consumer and industrial interfaces such as CAN FD[2], USB Type-C™, and USB Power Delivery, STM32L5 MCUs provide an ideal platform for products such as industrial sensors or controls, home-automation devices, smart meters, fitness trackers, smart watches, medical pumps or meters, and many others."</em> <a href="https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/about/media-center/press-item.html/p4087.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Prosthetic limbs have come a long way from the heavy, solid hands and legs of yesteryear, but it’s still difficult to pack a range of motion into them without complex or bulky machinery. But new research out of Cornell uses a cleverly designed 3D-printed mechanism to achieve speed and strength with simple construction — and it costs a lot less, too. “Developing prosthetic limbs requires designers to make difficult trade-offs among size, weight, force, speed, and cost of the actuation system,” the researchers say in their paper. For example, they point out, state of the art mechanical prosthetic hands can cost well over $10,000, with the high-end motors inside alone costing hundreds each. Cheaper hands use cheaper components, of course, which might mean that the hand can grip hard but not quickly, or vice versa. This is partly because a mechanical hand needs to be able to adjust the force it’s applying very quickly on the fly, and this usually involves some kind of variable transmission or dynamic gear ratio."</em> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/17/this-3d-printed-prosthetic-hand-combines-speed-and-strength-with-simplicity/">[...]</a>

It’s doing so using artificial intelligence (AI) powered by Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors and Intel® 3D NAND SSDs for storage. How It Works: Ships have dedicated Intel Xeon Scalable processor-based servers on board, turning them into cutting-edge floating data centers with heavy computation and AI inference capabilities. Rolls-Royce’s Intelligent Awareness System (IA) uses AI-powered sensor fusion and decision-making by processing data from lidar, radar, thermal cameras, HD cameras, satellite data and weather forecasts. This data allows vessels to become aware of their surroundings, improving safety by detecting objects several kilometers away, even in busy ports. This is especially important when operating at night, in adverse weather conditions or in congested waterways."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news/intel-artificial-intelligence-rolls-royce-push-full-steam-autonomous-shipping/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Astronomers from Lund University in Sweden have now found the explanation to a recent mystery at the centre of the Milky Way galaxy: the high levels of scandium discovered last spring near the galaxy’s giant black hole were in fact an optical illusion. Last spring, researchers published a study about the apparent presence of astonishing and dramatically high levels of three different elements in red giant stars, located less than three light years away from the big black hole at the centre of our galaxy. Various possible explanations were presented, for example that the high levels were a result of earlier stars being disrupted as they fall into the black hole, or a result of debris from the collisions of neutron stars. Now another group of astronomers from Lund University among others, in collaboration with UCLA in California, have found an explanation for the high levels of scandium, vanadium and yttrium. They argue that the so-called spectral lines presented last spring were actually an optical illusion. Spectral lines are used to find out which elements a star contains - by using its own light."</em> <a href="https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/article/researchers-solve-mystery-at-the-centre-of-the-milky-way">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Graphene enables ultra-wide bandwidth communications coupled with low power consumption, with potential to surpass the needs of 5G, IoT and Industry 4.0. Researchers within the Graphene Flagship project, one of the biggest research initiatives of the European Commission, showed that integrated graphene-based photonic devices offer a unique solution for the next generation of optical communications. Researchers in the initiative have demonstrated how properties of graphene enable ultra-wide bandwidth communications coupled with low power consumption to radically change the way data is transmitted across the optical communications systems. This could make graphene-integrated devices the key ingredient in the evolution of 5G, the Internet-of-Things (IoT), and Industry 4.0. The findings were published in Nature Reviews Materials and highlighted on the cover. "As conventional semiconductor technologies are approaching their physical limitations we need to explore entirely new technologies to realise our most ambitious visions of a future networked global society," explains Wolfgang Templ, Department Head of Transceiver Research at Nokia Bell Labs in Germany, which is a Graphene Flagship partner."</em> <a href="https://graphene-flagship.eu/news/Pages/Graphene-shows-unique-potential-to-exceed-bandwidth-demands-of-future-telecommunications.aspx">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This paper describes a system for autonomous spray painting using a UAV, suitable for industrial applications. The work is motivated by the potential for such a system to achieve accurate and fast painting results. The PaintCopter is a quadrotor that has been custom fitted with an arm plus a spray gun on a pan-tilt mechanism. To enable long deployment times for industrial painting tasks, power and paint are delivered by lines from an external unit. The ability to paint planar surfaces such as walls in single color is a basic requirement for a spray painting system. But this work addresses more sophisticated operation that subsumes the basic task, including painting on 3D structure, and painting of a desired texture appearance."</em> <a href="https://www.disneyresearch.com/publication/paintcopter/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/188572/pentacene-patterns-prove-crucial-solar-power/">Pentacene patterns prove crucial for solar power</a></h2>

<p><em>"Renewable solar power can be harnessed using solar cells, which are made of materials called semiconductors. In a solar cell, electrons are generated when photons, or packets of light, are absorbed by semiconductors and released as high energy electrons. However, in some materials, one photon can generate two excited electrons – a highly unusual phenomenon known as singlet fission.

Also, this is still a work in progress, so expect a few updates and changes (especially to the Matlab code) To get started I want to warn you, this requires three programs (one of them is pretty expensive), quite a few libraries and support packages for the programs, and you need to have them all speak to each other.

<p><em>"A few days ago I started playing with some idea I had from a few weeks already, using a Raspberry Pi Zero W to make a mini WiFi deauthenticator: something in my pocket that periodically jumps on all the channels in the WiFi spectrum, collects information about the nearby access points and their connected clients and then sends a deauthentication packet to each one of them, resulting in some sort of WiFi jammer on the 802.11 level. As an interesting “side effect” of this jammer (the initial intent was purely for the lulz) is that the more it deauths, the higher the changes to also sniff WPA2 handshakes. Thanks to the awesome work of the Kali and Nexmon communities in packaging the nexmon drivers and utilities and to the recent changes we released in bettercap, this was very easy to setup and to script and given the interest the tweet had I thought to share this writeup :)"</em> <a href="https://www.evilsocket.net/2018/07/28/Project-PITA-Writeup-build-a-mini-mass-deauther-using-bettercap-and-a-Raspberry-Pi-Zero-W/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"I found the personal compass project at Instructables.com quite interesting. Basically, a personal compass works like a regular compass, but instead of pointing to magnetic north, it points to a particular location of personal interest. Maybe it is pointing to the place where you were married, perhaps where your childhood home is. All this compass magic is done using an Arduino with a compass (magnetometer) sensor, GPS module and a servo motor to point the way. However, there were a couple of things I didn’t like about the original project: Extra gears were needed to increase the servo’s sweep to 360 degrees Location was hard coded into the code The extra gears complicated the build and it still had to “rewind” itself when it reached its 360 degree limit, so I decided to use a continuous servo with feedback. This allowed for full 360 degree rotation and beyond of the compass needle."</em> <a href="http://danthegeek.com/2018/10/12/improved-personal-compass/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This project describes a simple routine for plotting a function on a 128x64 I2C OLED graphics display. Unlike most Arduino graphics libraries this routine doesn't require a RAM buffer, and so will work on any processor down to an ATtiny85: The routine will work on monochrome 128x64 I2C OLED displays based on either the SSD1306 driver, such as the display available from Adafruit, or the SH1106 driver, used in displays available from Chinese suppliers. Introduction My earlier Tiny Graphics Library supported text and graphics plotting on displays using the SH1106 driver chip. Unlike those routines, these simpler routines will also work on the more commonly available displays based on an SSD1306 driver, such as Adafruit's 128x64 monochrome OLED display. A restriction with these routines is that they can only plot one value or pixel in each column; in other words, a function. For many applications, such as plotting the value from a sensor against time, this is exactly what you want, so this minimal routine is ideal."</em> <a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2CFT">[...]</a>

For short range, low-budget communication between two microcontrollers, one of the most preferred medium used is Radio Frequency (RF) communication using the 433MHz RF transmitter and receiver modules.

This logs to emoncms.org and optionally, either locally to a Raspberry PI or your own emoncms server. It features the LOLIN (formerly WEMOS) D1 Mini which incorporates the ESP8266 core. Temperature and Humidity sensor is the LOLIN DHT 3.0 I2C sensor. The software is Arduino and naturally, open source."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/IOT-Temp-Cheap-Durable-Temperature-and-Humidity-In/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"For projects with just a few LEDs, a small display or a buzzer, power is usually not a big issue and can easily be supplied by the Arduino pins itself or through a battery or small USB power supply. But for projects that involve larger motors, solenoids, high-power LEDs, Peltier elements, etc, the power management is often non-trivial and appropriate power supplies and switches (relays, MOSFETs, BJTs) become non-trivial parts of the design, often the most challenging! To test whether the project can handle the required current, it is often crucial to test it with a dummy load instead of the actual motor/lamp/relay. This allows in particular to stress-test the system by making it sure it can run with for example 400mA, when the actual motor only requires 300mA. Fancy dummy loads with constant current, constant power or constant resistance can be bought, but it's a niche market for professionals, and for a hobbyist a simpler system is often sufficient. The most common small-signal resistors used in circuits have a power rating of 0.25W, which is really not a lot."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/48W-Resistive-Load/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Cool little Pocket Metal Locator sensitive enough to identify small nails and tacks in wood with four independent search coils and LEDs. This cool little Pocket Metal Locator is sensitive enough to identify small nails and tacks in wood and compact enough to fit into awkward spaces making it convenient to carry and use for metal locating. The unit has four independent search coils and color LED indicators making it easy to cover a larger search area quickly while being able to accurately identify the target. This neat little device is self-calibrating with one button operation, rechargeable through a USB port and uses color LEDs, sound and vibration to indicate target strength. Included in the tutorial is all of the designs, testing, code and 3D files required to build on your own. I hope you enjoy building and using this as much as I have!!"</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/NZDoug/pocket-metal-locator-4f75fa">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/news/2799">Interactive Spooky Halloween Cat</a></h2>

<p><em>"Check out this distance sensing Halloween prop designed to spook the willies out of trick-or-treaters. As we approach the end of October, the spooky Halloween energy is starting to find its way into my world. I’m not much of a Halloween-er myself, but I have always felt that Halloween is an excellent excuse to show off your killer maker skills, creativity and maybe even scare some folks. This week I made a little interactive Halloween decoration that activates when someone walks by. My Interactive Spooky Halloween Cat consists of a plastic skeleton cat I found at Michaels and an enclosure that I laser cut from black acrylic. Inside the enclosure is a SparkFun BlackBoard as the brains of the project, an Ultrasonic Sensor for distance sensing, a Qwiic MP3 Trigger Board to add some hissing sound effects, a small hamburger speaker for the sound, a small servo motor to create motion in the cat’s jaw, 16 WS2812 LEDs to create the red light and a small breadboard to make the circuit building quick and easy."</em> <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/news/2799">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This is a very easy and low cost route to a digital photo frame – with the advantage of adding /removing photos over WiFi via ‘click and drag’ using a (free) file transfer program. It can be powered by the tiny £4.50 Pi Zero. You can also transfer photos direct from a mobile phone (e.g. via ES File Explorer on Android). This can be a standalone digital picture frame or can be the screensaver for a Pi based system (doing something else) and show pictures when it is not being used. For example, this could be the screensaver for a Pi based media controller or for an interface to my Pi based music and radio player."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Digital-Photo-Picture-Frame-WiFi-Linked-Raspberry-/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A signal generator is a very useful piece of test gear. This one uses an AD9833 module and an Arduino Nano - that's all, not even a PCB. You can optionally add an OLED display. The AD9833 can gererate sine, triangle and square waves from 0.1 MHz to 12.5 MHz - the software in this project is limited to 1Hz to 100kHz. There have been other Instructables using an Arduino and an AD9833, here and here. This is simpler and can be used as a sweep generator."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Signal-Generator-AD9833/">[...]</a>
