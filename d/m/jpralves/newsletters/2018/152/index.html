<p>Faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1819, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Drake">Edwin Drake</a>. Este engenheiro norte-americano da industria petrolífera perfurou o primeiro poço de petróleo produtivo perto de Titusville, Pensilvânia, que lançou a indústria moderna de petróleo dos EUA. O seu sucesso em atingir o petróleo baseou-se na sua crença de que a perfuração seria a melhor maneira de obter petróleo da Terra. Ele organizou a Seneca Oil Co., arrendou terras, e em 27 de Agosto de 1859, atingiu petróleo a uma profundidade de 21 metros. Drake usou um antigo motor a vapor para alimentar a perfuradora. Depois o seu poço começou a produzir petróleo.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1853, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elihu_Thomson">Elihu Thomson</a>. Este engenheiro e inventor inglês-americano foi responsável por descobertas no campo dos fenómenos da corrente alternada que conduziram ao desenvolvimento de motores de corrente alternada com sucesso. Thomson inventou a soldadura eléctrica e outras invenções importantes em iluminação eléctrica e energia, com um total de cerca de 700 patentes. Thomson também foi co-fundador da indústria General Electric Company (em 1892, numa fusão com a Edison Company).</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1873, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tullio_Levi-Civita">Tullio Levi-Civita</a>. Este matemático italiano foi um dos fundadores do cálculo diferencial absoluto (análise tensorial) que teve aplicações na teoria da relatividade. Em 1887, ele publicou um famoso artigo em que ele desenvolveu o cálculo de tensores. Em 1900, ele publicou, em conjunto com Ricci, a teoria dos tensores "Méthodes de calcul differential absolu et leures", numa forma que foi utilizada por Einstein 15 anos depois. Weyl também usou as idéias de Levi-Civita para produzir uma teoria unificada de gravitação e electromagnetismo. Além das importantes contribuições do seu trabalho na teoria da relatividade, Levi-Civita produziu uma série de artigos tratando elegantemente o problema dum campo gravitacional estático.</p>

<p>Na semana que passou ficámos a saber que produção em massa de carros impressos em 3-D está a chegar. O primeiro será da XEV e da Polymaker, um construtor de materiais de impressão 3D. O carro de US $ 7.500, chamado LSEV, levou apenas três dias para ser feito, de acordo com o criador. Todos os componentes no LSEV foram impressos, excepto o chassis, assentos e vidro. O carro de dois lugares parece muito com um carro inteligente, mas não é tão rápido. A sua velocidade máxima é de cerca de 43 quilómetros por hora.</p>

<p>Esta semana também ficámos a saber que a China está a construir um comboio super-maglev que atingirá velocidades perto de 1.000 quilómetros por hora. Cientistas chineses construíram a primeira plataforma de testes de protótipos do mundo para um comboio de levitação magnética a vácuo de altíssima velocidade (maglev). Desenvolvido pela Southwest Jiaotong University, de Sichuan, é o primeiro circuito de teste maglev supercondutor de alta temperatura na China. O circuito de 45 metros, com uma capacidade de carga projectada de 300 kg e uma carga máxima de 1.000 kg, pode levitar o comboio para mais de 20 milímetros acima da pista. É um sistema maglev supercondutor que tem a menor secção transversal e usa a menor quantidade de materiais magnéticos permanentes. O loop é capaz de realizar testes dinâmicos que variam de 0 a 50 quilómetros por hora.</p>

<p>E está a aproximar-se a colisão com a Terra da estação espacial Tiangong-1. Lançada para o espaço em 2011, à cerca de dois anos atrás a agência espacial chinesa informou a perda da telemetria e por consequência do controlo da estação começando nessa altura a mesma a decair em direcção à Terra. Com o peso de 8.5 toneladas, comprimento de 10 metros e diâmetro de 3.3 metros estima-se que este objecto reentre na atmosfera terrestre entre o meio-dia do dia 31 de Março e a tarde do dia 1 de Abril (hora UTC). Não havendo a certeza do local exacto onde irão cair os destroços que sobreviverem à reentrada, as probabilidades dos mesmo colidirem com pessoas ou habitações é imensamente reduzida, sendo provável que se irão despenhar no oceano. Existem um número de fontes na Internet que permitirão acompanhar este evento.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker. São apresentados também a revista MagPI 68 e um livro sobre circuitos baseados em desenhos de referência de laboratório da Analog Devices.</p>

<p><em>"Chinese scientists have built the world's first prototype testing platform for an ultra-high-speed vacuum magnetic levitation （maglev） train that can travel at a whopping 1,000 kilometers per hour under ideal conditions. Developed by Sichuan-based Southwest Jiaotong University, it is the first high-temperature superconducting maglev test loop in China. The 45-meter loop, with a designed load capacity of 300 kilograms and a maximum load of 1,000 kilograms, can levitate the train to over 20 millimeters above the track. It is a superconducting maglev system that has the smallest cross section and uses the smallest amount of permanent magnet materials. The loop is capable of conducting dynamic tests ranging from 0 to 50 kilometers per hour. According to team leader Deng Zigang, also professor from the Sichuan-based university, the actual load capacity of 1,000 kilograms is the core competence of the technology."</em> <a href="http://en.people.cn/n3/2018/0311/c90000-9435653.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"China’s spiraling space station, Tiangong-1, looks like it will plummet to Earth and burn up in the atmosphere sometime on April 1st — though where it will fall is still up for debate. So if you want to keep an eye on Tiangong-1’s whereabouts over the weekend, there are numerous space agencies and websites to follow. First off, a reminder: this space station is the last thing you need to worry about. Tiangong-1 has been hyped up since it’s particularly heavy and dense, so large chunks of it are expected to survive to the ground. Plus, China lost the ability to control the station from Earth, so the country’s space agency can’t simply dump the station over open ocean. That said, the chances of Tiangong-1 crashing on a person or house are infinitesimal."</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/29/17175864/china-space-station-tiangong-1-space-debris-track-fall">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Since its launch in 2013, the Yùn–a small Linux machine and a microcontroller in a small Arduino form factor–found its way into hundreds of thousands of projects and professional applications. Last year, we decided that it was time for a refresh and began working hard to develop a true open-source design, with more compelling features and better overall software support. The new board, which is expected to hit the market in the second half of April, will include enhanced functionality and compatibility with its predecessor. Why a New Yùn The Yùn enjoyed tremendous success; however, it ended up being affected by the internal issues we dealt with over the past couple of years and support has been quite intermittent. For example, the board was never really an open-source product and the software had some challenges that we wanted to fix, especially from a security point of view. What’s New in Rev.2 Hardware: - Much better, more robust power supply - New Ethernet connector with a clever mounting solution that enables the use of all possible shields with no risk for accidental short circuits - Horizontal USB connector to save vertical space - Improved USB hub Software: - Software stack updated to OpenWRT latest version, including all patches - SSL support on the bridge Arduino / Linux bridge"</em> <a href="https://blog.arduino.cc/2018/03/29/arduino-yun-rev-2-is-here/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Nissan unveiled research today that will enable vehicles to interpret signals from the driver’s brain, redefining how people interact with their cars. The company’s Brain-to-Vehicle, or B2V, technology promises to speed up reaction times for drivers and will lead to cars that keep adapting to make driving more enjoyable. Nissan will demonstrate capabilities of this exclusive technology at the CES 2018 trade show in Las Vegas. B2V is the latest development in Nissan Intelligent Mobility, the company’s vision for transforming how cars are driven, powered and integrated into society. “When most people think about autonomous driving, they have a very impersonal vision of the future, where humans relinquish control to the machines. Yet B2V technology does the opposite, by using signals from their own brain to make the drive even more exciting and enjoyable,” said Nissan Executive Vice President Daniele Schillaci."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.nissan-global.com/releases/release-3459ed449767a2e07b2e465ced0014bc-180103-01-e">[...]</a>

<p><em>"GPU Technology Conference NVIDIA today announced the NVIDIA Quadro GV100 GPU with NVIDIA RTX technology, delivering for the first time real-time ray tracing to millions of artists and designers. The biggest advance in computer graphics since the introduction of programmable shaders nearly two decades ago, NVIDIA RTX when combined with the powerful Quadro GV100 GPU makes computationally intensive ray tracing possible in real time when running professional design and content creation applications. Media and entertainment professionals can see and interact with their creations with correct light and shadows, and do complex renders up to 10x faster than with a CPU alone. Product designers and architects can create interactive, photoreal visualizations of massive 3D models all in real time. NVIDIA has reinvented the workstation by taking ray-tracing technology optimized for our Volta architecture, and marrying it with the highest-performance hardware ever put in a workstation, said Bob Pette, vice president of Professional Visualization at NVIDIA. Artists and designers can simulate and interact with their creations in ways never before possible, which will fundamentally change workflows across many industries."</em> <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-reinvents-the-workstation-with-real-time-ray-tracing-6683520">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Team Advances Exploration of UAE’s Sand as Thermal Energy Storage Material for Particle Solar Receiver Technology A Khalifa University research team has taken another step towards unlocking the potential of the UAE’s sand as a thermal energy storage material with research showing the utilization of sand in a Direct Absorption Receiver (DAR) through an innovative gravity-fed solar receiver and storage system. The ‘Sandstock’ project, launched by a research team at Masdar Institute in 2013, has the aim of utilizing the UAE’s sand in place of the molten salts typically used in Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) with storage systems. That research has explored the use of sand as a material that has a higher temperature tolerance than conventional thermal storage materials while also being more environmentally friendly and lower cost. Earlier research by the team, led by Dr. Nicolas Calvet, Assistant Professor of Mechanical and Materials Engineering and Chair of the Masdar Institute Solar Platform (MISP), found that the UAE’s sand was thermally stable between approximately 650°C to 1000°C. Because conventional molten salt thermal energy storage media start to degrade at about 565°C, sand is a potentially more suitable thermal energy storage material than molten salt for high temperature Concentrated Solar Power (CSP). TES materials with high thermal stability can transfer significant heat to the working fluids that spin the turbines in CSP power plants and this makes for higher efficiency power plants."</em> <a href="https://news.masdar.ac.ae/explore-news/stories-by-type/innovation/item/10413-research-guides-sand-sourcing-for-innovative-solar-technology.html">[...]</a>

A motif of Japanese basketweaving known as the kagome pattern has preoccupied physicists for decades. Kagome baskets are typically made from strips of bamboo woven into a highly symmetrical pattern of interlaced, corner-sharing triangles. If a metal or other conductive material could be made to resemble such a kagome pattern at the atomic scale, with individual atoms arranged in similar triangular patterns, it should in theory exhibit exotic electronic properties. In a paper published today in Nature, physicists from MIT, Harvard University, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory report that they have for the first time produced a kagome metal — an electrically conducting crystal, made from layers of iron and tin atoms, with each atomic layer arranged in the repeating pattern of a kagome lattice. When they flowed a current across the kagome layers within the crystal, the researchers observed that the triangular arrangement of atoms induced strange, quantum-like behaviors in the passing current."</em> <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2018/physicists-discover-new-quantum-electronic-material-0319">[...]</a>

This approach, which operates quantum logic gates with 99.9 per cent precision, offers an attractive pathway for manufacturing fault-tolerant quantum computers on a large scale. Quantum bits, or ‘qubits’, exploit quantum superposition states to generate far higher computational powers than conventional semiconductor circuits. Electron spins are leading candidates for such qubits, which can be implemented in structures similar to today’s computing devices. To perform practical numbers of computing operations, these spin qubits need to maintain the superposition of ‘up’ and ‘down’ spin orientations for extended times—a property known as coherence. Unfortunately, these spin states are highly sensitive to magnetic noise from surrounding atoms, such as those on silicon chips."</em> <a href="http://www.riken.jp/en/research/rikenresearch/highlights/20180323_0057/">[...]</a>

With the rise of cloud computing services like Facebook and Google, datacenters have to process exponentially increasing amounts of information. To fulfill the need for more bandwidth, they keep adding more servers, leading to enormous datacenters which currently in The Netherlands alone consume about 2 Terawatt-hour a year ­̶ 2 percent of the total national electrical energy consumption.

<h2><a href="http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/news/news_releases/release.sfe?id=2502">Flexible ultrasound patch could make it easier to inspect damage in odd-shaped structures</a></h2>

<p><em>"Researchers have developed a stretchable, flexible patch that could make it easier to perform ultrasound imaging on odd-shaped structures, such as engine parts, turbines, reactor pipe elbows and railroad tracks—objects that are difficult to examine using conventional ultrasound equipment. The ultrasound patch is a versatile and more convenient tool to inspect machine and building parts for defects and damage deep below the surface. A team of researchers led by engineers at the University of California San Diego published the study in the Mar. 23 issue of Science Advances. The new device overcomes a limitation of today’s ultrasound devices, which are difficult to use on objects that don’t have perfectly flat surfaces. Conventional ultrasound probes have flat and rigid bases, which can’t maintain good contact when scanning across curved, wavy, angled and other irregular surfaces."</em> <a href="http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/news/news_releases/release.sfe?id=2502">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Students at The University of Manchester have designed and built a 3D printed, low-cost robotic prosthetic hand that could provide a much cheaper alternative for amputees. The hand’s joints are all fully posable with each individual finger and the thumb being able to move as well as make a fist. The functionality of the hand allows its user to do simple everyday tasks such as picking up items, eating using a knife and fork, typing and clicking a mouse or opening doors. It can even play rock-paper-scissors. But what also makes the prototype limb standout is its cost. The students built the hand for just £307 and reckon they can make it evening cheaper."</em> <a href="http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/students-create-3d-printed-robot-prosthetic-limb-for-amputees/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Have you ever wondered how your computer knows all the characteristics of your monitor— the supported resolutions, the model, and even the serial number? Most monitors use a system called DDC to communicate this information to the computer.1 This information is transmitted using the I2C communication protocol—a protocol also popular for connecting hobbyist devices. In this post, I look inside a VGA monitor cable, use a tiny PocketBeagle (a single-board computer in the BeagleBone family) to read the I2C data from an LCD monitor, and then analyze this data. To connect to the monitor, I cut a VGA cable in half and figured out which wire goes to which pin.3 The wire (above) is constructed in an interesting way, more complicated than I expected. The red, green, blue and horizontal sync signals are transmitted over coaxial-like cables formed by wrapping a wire a spiral of thin copper wires for shielding.2 The remaining signals travel over thinner plain wires. Several strands of string form the structural center of the VGA cable, and the ten internal wires are wrapped in a foil shield and woven outer shield."</em> <a href="http://www.righto.com/2018/03/reading-vga-monitors-configuration-data.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This Rotating Lithophane box is a derivative of my previous box, with the added feature of rotation! My wife liked the first version, but said that it would be much better if it rotated. Makes sense. I thought about incorporating a small stepper motor, or a servo motor to get the box to rotate, but since this is more of a static object that will be sitting around most of the time, it doesn't need to be fancy, or overly complicated. A slow, nearly imperceptible rotation would be ideal, about one full rotation every hour or so. Hmm, what rotates once every hour?"</em> <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Rotating-Lithophane-Box/">[...]</a>

To demonstrate the graphics library I've written a simple application to measure the temperature every 15 minutes over a 24-hour period and display it as a live chart. Introduction The monochrome OLED graphics displays are accessed a byte at a time, and each byte represents 8 pixels; to plot a point you need to change just one pixel leaving the others unaffected, so you need to know what the previous contents of the byte were. The usual way to implement graphics commands on this type of display is to use a RAM buffer, and do all the drawing into the buffer.
