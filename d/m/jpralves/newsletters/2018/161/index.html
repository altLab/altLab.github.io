<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1744, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Lovell_Edgeworth">Richard Lovell Edgeworth</a>. Este Inglês-irlandês foi inventor de inovações mecânicas, incluindo uma tentativa de comunicação telegráfica (possivelmente a primeira), um velocípede, um carro medidor, um cortador de nabos, máquinas agrícolas melhoradas e fez igualmente descobertas no campo da electricidade. No final da década de 1790, ele propôs o tellograph para "transmitir inteligência secreta e rápida" usando 30 torres altas espaçadas entre Dublin e Galway (130 milhas). Retransmitidos de torre em torre usando grandes ponteiros triangulares, as mensagens codificadas poderiam chegar a Dublin em apenas oito minutos. Infelizmente, a fraca visibilidade devido ao tempo condenou a ideia.</p>

<p>Faz também anos hoje que nascia, em 1852, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Richard_Petri">Julius Richard Petri</a>. Este médico e bacteriologista alemão é conhecido pelo seu nome dado à placa de Petri. Trata-se de um prato cilíndrico, raso, feito de plástico ou vidro com uma cobertura, usado para culturas de tecidos e para manter meios sólidos para cultura e sub-cultura de bactérias. Petri desenvolveu-o para uma técnica de clonagem de cepas bacterianas usando um declive de ágar e sub-cultura no seu prato, reconhecendo diferentes colónias bacterianas e novamente sub-cultivando.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente anos hoje que nascia, em 1930, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Toomer">Ron Toomer</a>. Este Engenheiro americano ficou conhecido por ter sido um lendário criador de montanhas-russas de aço. O seu início de carreira foi na indústria aeroespacial, onde ajudou a projectar o escudo térmico para a nave espacial Apollo e também se envolveu com os primeiros lançamentos de satélites da NASA. Em 1965, ele juntou-se à Arrow Development Company para aplicar a tecnologia de aço tubular ao projeto Runaway Mine Ride, a primeira montanha-russa de aço do mundo. Abriu no ano seguinte no Six Flags sobre o Texas. Em 1975, ele projectou o Corkscrew da Roaring 20 para a Knott's Berry Farm, introduzindo as primeiras voltas de 360°, na verdade dois deles. Mais tarde, o seu projecto incluiu sete inversões na montanha-russa Shockwave para o Six Flags Great America. Ele produziu mais de 80 montanhas-russas antes de se aposentar em 1998.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz anos hoje que nascia, em 1931, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Robert_Schrieffer">John Robert Schrieffer</a>. Este físico americano partilhou (com John Bardeen e Leon N. Cooper) o Prémio Nobel de Física de 1972 por desenvolver a teoria do BCS (para suas iniciais), a primeira teoria microscópica bem-sucedida da supercondutividade. Embora descrito pela primeira vez por Kamerlingh Onnes (1911), nenhuma explicação teórica foi aceita. Explica como certos metais e ligas perdem toda a resistência à corrente eléctrica a temperaturas extremamente baixas. O principio da teoria do BCS é que a temperaturas muito baixas, sob certas condições, os electrões podem formar pares ligados (pares de Cooper). Este par de electrões actua como uma única partícula na supercondutividade.</p>

<p>Na semana que passou a Intel apresentou a nova geração do Intel Optane DC. Trata-se de uma nova classe de memória e tecnologia de armazenamento desenhada para extrair mais valor dos dados. Encontrando-se posicionada entre os dispositivos SSD e a DRAM, a memória persistente Intel Optane DC oferecerá a combinação inédita de alta capacidade, acessibilidade e persistência. Ao expandir as capacidades de memória de sistema acessíveis (maior que 3 terabytes por socket de CPU), os clientes finais podem usar sistemas habilitados com essa nova classe de memória para otimizar melhor suas cargas de trabalho movendo e mantendo grandes quantidades de dados mais próximas do processador e minimizando a latência de ler dados do armazenamento do sistema. A memória persistente da Intel estará disponível em capacidades de até 512 GB por módulo.</p>

<p>Também esta semana ficámos a saber que na Holanda, na cidade de Eindhoven, começará a ser construída a primeira das cinco casas planeadas de betão impressas em 3D ainda este ano. O projecto, chamado Project Milestone, é o primeiro do mundo, já que as casas estarão todas ocupadas. O projecto será realizado na área de expansão da cidade de Eindhoven, Meerhoven, nos próximos cinco anos. A primeira casa, que será uma casa de piso único, deve estar pronta para ocupação em meados de 2019. As outras quatro casas serão de vários andares.</p>

<p>A Virgin Galactic mostrou que a utilização do seu motor de foguete químico no seu avião espacial não foi por acaso, depois do esforço do mês passado com outra saída de sucesso na Califórnia. O último voo de teste levou o veículo espacial de transporte turístico um pouco mais próximo do espaço, literal e figuradamente, com os engenheiros a examinar os dados com preparando-se já para a próxima volta de testes. Onde algumas empresas espaciais privadas, como a Blue Origin, imaginam enviar turistas ao espaço com veículos de lançamento convencionais que descolam do solo, a SpaceShipTwo VSS Unity da Virgin Galactic funciona de forma um pouco diferente. Durante o voo de teste no mês passado, foi transportado para o ar por uma nave mãe chamada WhiteKnightTwo e liberada a uma altitude de 14.173 m. Segundos depois, o seu motor de foguete híbrido foi accionado por cerca de 30 segundos para impulsionar o avião a cerca de Mach 1,9 (2.328 km / h) e uma altitude de 25.686 m. O segundo voo de teste foi executado de forma bastante similar, mas foi montado para observar o comportamento do avião numa configuração que se assemelharia mais a sua configuração comercial final.</p>

<p>Ainda esta semana foi anunciado que cientistas descobrem os segredos das dunas de metano de Plutão. A análise dos dados da NASA descobriu que o planeta anão tem um ambiente altamente dinâmico. Há dunas em Plutão feitas de areia de metano, os cientistas que estudam os dados do sobrevoo da New Horizons em 2015 tendo anunciado os resultados na revista Science. Quando viram pela primeira vez as imagens da New Horizons, os investigadores, liderados por Matt Telfer, da Universidade de Plymouth, no Reino Unido, acharam que pareciam dunas de areia na Terra, mas não acreditavam nos seus olhos. Com uma atmosfera 100.000 vezes menos densa que a do nosso próprio planeta, parecia não haver possibilidade de que Plutão fosse forte o suficiente para mover quaisquer partículas. Os cientistas começaram a procurar explicações para as 357 cordilheiras semelhantes a dunas e seis estrias escuras em uma grande planície chamada Sputnik Planitia, ao lado de uma série de altas montanhas.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversos projetos de maker assim como alguns modelos 3D que poderão ser úteis. É apresentada a revista newelectronics de 22 de Maio e a revista MagPI nº70 de Junho.</p>

<p><em>"Intel Optane DC Persistent Memory Represents a New Class of Memory and Storage Technology Architected to Extract Further Value from Data We’ve all heard about escalating mountains of data – and yes, there is a tremendous amount of data generated daily that must be stored, secured and organized. More interesting than the amount of data is the value it represents. Value that comes from analysis and the resulting insights. Data may store the next great business opportunity, societal advancement or scientific discovery. While we’ve made great progress as an industry in providing the infrastructure, tools and best practices to drive this analysis, limitations are also emerging. Not only is the volume and variety of data growing, but the velocity of desired insights is accelerating."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/re-architecting-data-center-memory-storage-hierarchy/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In the city of Eindhoven (The Netherlands) the realization of the first of five planned 3D-printed concrete houses will start this year. The project, called Project Milestone, is a world’s first, as the houses will all be occupied. The project partners (municipality of Eindhoven, Eindhoven University of Technology, contractor Van Wijnen, real estate manager Vesteda, materials company Saint Gobain-Weber Beamix and engineering firm Witteveen+Bos) revealed the design and the building site today. The project will be realized in the Eindhoven city expansion area Meerhoven over the next five years. The first house, which will be a single-floor house, is expected to be ready for occupation mid 2019. The other four houses will be multi-storey houses."</em> <a href="https://www.3dprintedhouse.nl/en/news/2050/the-first-3d-concrete-printing-housing-project/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://newatlas.com/virgin-galactic-vss-unity-flight-space/54828/">Virgin Galactic's spaceplane hits new heights in second powered flight</a></h2>

<p><em>"Virgin Galactic has shown the first firing of its spaceplane's chemical rocket engine was no fluke, following last month's effort with another successful outing in California. The latest test flight took the tourist-carrying space vehicle a little closer to space, literally and figuratively, with engineers now poring over data with an eye to the next round of testing. Where some private space companies, such as Blue Origin, imagine firing tourists into space with conventional launch vehicles that blast off from the ground, Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo VSS Unity works a little differently. During the test flight last month, it was carried into the air by a mothership called WhiteKnightTwo and released at an altitude of 46,500 ft (14,173 m). Seconds later, its hybrid rocket engine was fired up for around 30 seconds to propel the plane to roughly Mach 1.9 (2,328 kph/1,446 mph) and an altitude of 84,271 ft (25,686 m). Today's second test flight played out pretty similarly, but was set up to observe the behavior of the plane in a setup that will more closely resemble its final commercial configuration."</em> <a href="https://newatlas.com/virgin-galactic-vss-unity-flight-space/54828/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Analysis of NASA data finds the dwarf planet has a highly dynamic environment. Phil Dooley reports. There are dunes on Pluto made of methane sand, the scientists studying the data from the NASA 2015 New Horizons flypast have announced in the journal Science. When they first saw the images from New Horizons, the researchers, led by Matt Telfer from the University of Plymouth in the UK, thought they looked like sand dunes on Earth, but didn’t believe their eyes. With an atmosphere 100,000 times less dense than that on our own planet, there seemed no possibility that Pluto experienced strong enough to move any particles about. The scientists began searching for explanations for 357 dune-like ridges and six dark streaks on a large plain called the Sputnik Planitia, next to a range of high mountains."</em> <a href="https://cosmosmagazine.com/space/scientists-unlock-the-secrets-of-pluto-s-methane-dunes">[...]</a>

However, the same cannot be said for laptops, which have struggled to adapt to a slowing Moore’s Law over the last few years, delivering annual performance gains averaging only single-digit percentages while failing to enable any significant increases in battery life. This cadence of significant smartphone performance efficiency increases enabled by Arm did not go unnoticed by the Windows laptop ecosystem which now have integrated Arm-based SoCs from Qualcomm into their initial Always-Connected PC offerings. These Arm-based laptops are already paying off with an unprecedented 20-plus hours of battery life and steadily improving performance thanks to ongoing OS and application optimizations. Yet, the first-generation of Arm-based laptops are just the first step in the aforementioned annual performance cadence for those devices.

The vibrational motion of an atom in a crystal propagates to neighboring atoms, which leads to wavelike propagation of the vibrations throughout the crystal. The way in which these natural vibrations travel through the crystalline structure determine fundamental properties of the material. For example, these vibrations determine how well heat and electrons can traverse the material, and how the material interacts with light. Now, researchers have shown that by swapping out just a small fraction of a material's atoms with atoms of a different element, they can control the speed and frequencies of these vibrations.

The substances are among those applied to devices, such as laptops and music systems, as flame retardants and pigments but remain within the products when they reach the end of their useful lives. Now scientists at the University of Plymouth have shown that a combination of the growing demand for black plastic and the inefficient sorting of end-of-life electrical equipment is causing contaminated material to be introduced into the recyclate. This is in part because despite black plastics constituting about 15 per cent of the domestic waste stream, this waste material is not readily recycled owing to the low sensitivity of black pigments to near infrared radiation used in conventional plastic sorting facilities. The study is published in Environmental International and was conducted by Dr Andrew Turner, a Reader in Environmental Science at the University.

<p><em>"Scientists recently developed a blueprint to fabricate new nanoheterostructures using 2-D materials. Nanoscientists at Northwestern University have developed a blueprint to fabricate new heterostructures from different types of 2-D materials. 2-D materials are single atom layers that can be stacked together like “nano-interlocking building blocks.” Materials scientists and physicists are excited about the properties of 2-D materials and their potential applications. The researchers describe their blueprint in the Journal of Applied Physics, from AIP Publishing. “We’ve outlined an easy, deterministic and readily deployable way to stack and stitch these individual layers into orders not seen in nature,” said Jeffrey Cain, an author on the paper who was formerly at Northwestern University but is now at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California. Cain explained that for nanoscientists, “the dream” is to combine 2-D materials in any order and collate a library of these heterostructures with their documented properties."</em> <a href="https://publishing.aip.org/publishing/journal-highlights/building-nanomaterials-next-generation-computing">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The first human corneas have been 3D printed by scientists at Newcastle University. It means the technique could be used in the future to ensure an unlimited supply of corneas. As the outermost layer of the human eye, the cornea has an important role in focusing vision. Yet there is a significant shortage of corneas available to transplant, with 10 million people worldwide requiring surgery to prevent corneal blindness as a result of diseases such as trachoma, an infectious eye disorder. In addition, almost 5 million people suffer total blindness due to corneal scarring caused by burns, lacerations, abrasion or disease. The proof-of-concept research, published today in Experimental Eye Research, reports how stem cells (human corneal stromal cells) from a healthy donor cornea were mixed together with alginate and collagen to create a solution that could be printed, a ‘bio-ink’."</em> <a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/press/articles/latest/2018/05/first3dprintingofcorneas/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/news/2916/">Cometh the cyborg: improved integration of living muscles into robots</a></h2>

<p><em>"The new field of biohybrid robotics involves the use of living tissue within robots, rather than just metal and plastic. Muscle is one potential key component of such robots, providing the driving force for movement and function. However, in efforts to integrate living muscle into these machines, there have been problems with the force these muscles can exert and the amount of time before they start to shrink and lose their function. Now, in a study reported in the journal Science Robotics, researchers at The University of Tokyo Institute of Industrial Science have overcome these problems by developing a new method that progresses from individual muscle precursor cells, to muscle-cell-filled sheets, and then to fully functioning skeletal muscle tissues. They incorporated these muscles into a biohybrid robot as antagonistic pairs mimicking those in the body to achieve remarkable robot movement and continued muscle function for over a week. The team first constructed a robot skeleton on which to install the pair of functioning muscles."</em> <a href="https://www.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/news/2916/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"NIST researchers have developed a compact, high-accuracy, point-of-use high-power laser power meter in the form of a folding mirror called “Smart Mirror,” making in-situ, real-time measurement of laser power possible Orlando, FL – High-power lasers are now widely used in additive manufacturing and laser welding systems to precisely cut and weld metal, making all kinds of metal parts for medical devices, aerospace applications, automotive industries, and more. With the rise in industrial use of high-power laser processing, manufacturers increasingly seek high-accuracy, point-of-use laser power meters that can quickly report laser powers at any time in the manufacturing process -- a vital aspect to controlling product quality. Traditional laser power meters, however, are often bulky in size and slow in response time. Power measurements can also only be taken separately, interrupting the manufacturing process. Now, a group of researchers from National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Boulder, Colorado, have developed a smaller, faster and more sensitive laser power meter in the form of a folding mirror they call a “smart mirror.” The novel design uses a capacitor-based force transducer and merges optical elements, namely a high reflectivity mirror, and sensing elements into a compact cube package. The four-centimeter-on-a-side cubes can be conveniently embedded into laser optical systems or laser-welding systems for point-of-use, real-time laser power measurement and calibration."</em> <a href="https://www.osa.org/en-us/about_osa/newsroom/news_releases/2018/novel_power_meter_opens_the_door_for_in-situ_real/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Advancement could pave the way for less expensive, longer-lasting batteries for electric vehicles A Northwestern University research team has found ways to stabilize a new battery with a record-high charge capacity. Based on a lithium-manganese-oxide cathode, the breakthrough could enable smart phones and battery-powered automobiles to last more than twice as long between charges. “This battery electrode has realized one of the highest-ever reported capacities for all transition-metal-oxide-based electrodes. It’s more than double the capacity of materials currently in your cell phone or laptop,” said Christopher Wolverton, the Jerome B. Cohen Professor of Materials Science and Engineering in Northwestern’s McCormick School of Engineering, who led the study. “This sort of high capacity would represent a large advancement to the goal of lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles.” The study was published online May 18 in Science Advances. Lithium-ion batteries work by shuttling lithium ions back and forth between the anode and the cathode."</em> <a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2018/may/northwestern-researchers-predict-materials-to-stabilize-record-high-capacity-lithium-ion-battery/">[...]</a>

Such energy-efficient scenarios may one day be possible with improvements in thermoelectric materials — which spontaneously produce electricity when one side of the material is heated. Over the last 60 years or so, scientists have studied a number of materials to characterize their thermoelectric potential, or the efficiency with which they convert heat to power.

Check both for print quality and for how well each curve lines up with the backing. I've included pictures of a 40mm version of this printed out on an Ultimaker 3 with PLA and standard Cura settings. You can see fairly typical results for this type of overhang test: a relatively serene and normal top surface, concealing the horror show that increasingly engulfs the underside as the overhang passes the magic 45-degree mark. With thin curves like this, errors are introduced from at least two sources: the usual sag of unsupported material at the edge of each layer, and the slight mismatches caused by the curves being pushed ever-so-slightly back and forth by the tip of the nozzle.Feedback is welcomed."</em> <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2930478">[...]</a>
