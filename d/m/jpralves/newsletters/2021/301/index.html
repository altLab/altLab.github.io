<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1875, o físico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Prandtl">Ludwig Prandtl</a>. Ele é conhecido pelo seus estudos de aerodinâmica e hidrodinâmica. Ele estabeleceu a existência da camada limite adjacente à superfície de um sólido sobre o qual flui um fluido. O desenho de uma forma, peso e massa eficientes para navios e aeronaves deve muito ao seu trabalho, pelo qual ele é considerado o pai da aerodinâmica. Ele fez grandes estudos sobre os efeitos da racionalização e as propriedades das asas de aeronaves. Ele fez melhorias em construções como túneis de vento. O número de Prandtl é um grupo adimensional usado no estudo da convecção. A equação de von Karman-Prandtl descreve a variação logarítmica da velocidade da água dentro de um canal de fluxo zero no leito do riacho a uma velocidade máxima na superfície da água.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1896, o físico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hund">Friedrich Hund</a>. Ele ficou conhecido pelo seu trabalho sobre a estrutura electrónica de átomos e moléculas. Ele introduziu um método de uso de orbitais moleculares para determinar a estrutura electrónica das moléculas e a formação de ligações químicas. As suas regras empíricas de Hund (1925) para espectros atómicos determinam o nível de energia mais baixo para dois electrões com os mesmos n e l números quânticos num átomo de muitos electrões (1). O estado de menor energia tem a multiplicidade máxima consistente com o princípio de exclusão de Pauli. O estado de menor energia tem o número quântico total máximo do momento angular orbital do electrão, consistente com a regra (1). Eles são explicados pela teoria quântica dos átomos por cálculos envolvendo a repulsão entre dois electrões.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1902, o aviador norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Lindbergh">Charles Lindbergh</a>. Ele fez o primeiro voo sozinho sem escalas, em 1927, através do Atlântico. Em 20 de maio de 1927, Lindbergh partiu de Nova York para Paris, carregando sanduiches e água. Ele decidiu não carregar pára-quedas e rádio, preferindo mais gasolina. Ele lutou contra a névoa, o gelo e a sonolência e pousou em Paris em 21 de maio, após 33 horas e meia em seu voo de cerca de 5.800 Km.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1906, o astrónomo norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clyde_Tombaugh">Clyde Tombaugh</a>. Ele descobriu Plutão, então conhecido como planeta. Ele tinha 24 anos, trabalhava no Observatório Lowell, Flagstaff, Arizona, quando o localizou em 13 de Março de 1930. Ele estava comparando uma chapa fotográfica tirada a 23 de Janeiro de 1930, com outra feita alguns dias depois, e viu um ponto que mudou de posição entre elas. Assim terminou uma busca sistemática de décadas instigada pelas previsões de outros astrónomos. Tombaugh também descobriu vários aglomerados de estrelas e galáxias, estudou a distribuição aparente de nebulosas extra-galácticas e fez observações das superfícies de Marte, Vénus, Júpiter, Saturno e da Lua. Plutão foi o único planeta descoberto no século 20 e o único encontrado por um norte-americano.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1925, o Matemático inglês, nascido no Japão, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Zeeman">Christopher Zeeman</a>. Ele é conhecido pelo seu trabalho promovendo a teoria da catástrofe depois que ela foi introduzida na década de 1960 pelo matemático francês René Thom. Tal teoria diz que a probabilidade de que eventos repentinos ocorrerão pode ser prevista marcando os desenvolvimentos matematicamente. Um exemplo sobre o qual Zeeman escreveu como um evento repentino é para água aquecida quando começa a ferver. Como outras áreas de aplicabilidade, ele oferece uma gama de disciplinas tão diversas quanto equilíbrios pontuados em evolução, meteorologia e psicologia comportamental. Este último aplicaria matemática para analisar situações de sequestro ou refém.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1927, o físico norte-americano nascido na Alemanha <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolf_Landauer">Rolf Landauer</a>. Ele é conhecido pela sua formulação do princípio de Landauer sobre a energia usada durante a operação de um computador. Sempre que a máquina é reiniciada para outro cálculo, os bits são libertados da memória do computador e, nessa operação electrónica, uma certa quantidade de energia é perdida. Assim, quando a informação é apagada, há um inevitável "custo termodinâmico do esquecimento", que governa o desenvolvimento de computadores mais eficientes em termos de energia. Enquanto os engenheiros lidavam com as limitações práticas de compactar cada vez mais circuitos em minúsculos chips, Landauer considerou o limite teórico de que, se a tecnologia melhorasse indefinidamente, em quanto tempo ela barraria com as fronteiras insuperáveis estabelecidas pela natureza?</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1943, o pioneiro norte-americano da ciência da computação <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson">Ken Thompson</a>. Ele trabalhou na Bell Labs durante a maior parte de sua carreira, onde projectou e implementou o sistema operativo Unix original. Ele também inventou a linguagem de programação B, a predecessora directa da linguagem de programação C, e foi um dos criadores do sistema operativo Plan 9. Desde 2006, Thompson trabalha no Google, onde co-inventou a linguagem de programação Go. Outras contribuições notáveis incluíram seu trabalho em expressões regulares e primeiros editores de texto de computador QED e ed, a definição da codificação UTF-8 e seu trabalho em xadrez de computador que incluiu a criação de bases de mesa de final de jogo e a máquina de xadrez Belle. Ele ganhou o Prémio Turing em 1983 com seu colega de longa data Dennis Ritchie.</p>

<p>E nesta semana que passou, e depois de alguns adiamentos, a SpaceX lançou o foguetão SN9. A missão não teve o fim esperado uma vez que o foguetão explodiu à aterragem tendo o mesmo final que o seu antecessor, o SN8. O foguetão de três motores voou até uma altitude de 10 quilómetros, desligando então os seus motores em sequência enquanto subia mais alto. De seguida, começou uma longa queda de volta à Terra, como fez seu antecessor SN8 durante um voo de teste em Dezembro. Ao chegar para aterrar, o SN9 executou uma queima final para se orientar verticalmente, então deu-se a aterragem que foi violenta e não totalmente vertical, explodindo no impacto.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou, a SpaceX teve outra missão, esta sim com sucesso, colocando mais 60 satélites Starlink usando um foguetão que bateu o recorde de utilizações conseguindo aterrar com sucesso. O foguetão Falcon 9 de dois estágios, fez um voo de cerca de 9 minutos, retornando à Terra e aterrando numa das barcaças que se encontra no oceano Atlântico. A barcaça gigante "Of Course I Still Love You," é uma das duas que tem o trabalho de recolher os foguetões lançados. Este foi o quinto lançamento deste primeiro estágio do Falcon 9, que tinha voado pela última vez há apenas 27 dias - a reutilização mais rápida entre as missões para qualquer foguetão SpaceX. O lançamento de hoje também foi o primeiro de duas descolagens Starlink quase consecutivas; outros 60 satélites estão programados para voar na manhã de sexta-feira (5 de Fevereiro) noutro Falcon 9 diferente.</p>

<p><em>"After delays and a flap with the FAA, the Mars rocket prototype ran a vertical 10K on Tuesday. The second flight of a prototype of Elon Musk's next-generation Starship rocket, meant for eventual trips to Mars, was picture-perfect right up until the landing, which like the test of an earlier prototype, ended in a fiery explosion on Tuesday. After several delays and a dust-up with the Federal Aviation Administration over its launch license, SpaceX launched the vehicle dubbed SN9 from its Boca Chica, Texas, facility at around 12:30 p.m. PT. The three-engine rocket flew to an altitude of 6.2 miles (10 kilometers), shutting off its three engines in sequence as it climbed higher. It then began a long fall back to Earth, as its predecessor SN8 did during a test flight in December. As it came in for a landing, SN9 executed a landing burn to orient itself vertically for touchdown, then appeared to land hard and not quite vertical, exploding on impact just as SN8 did."</em> <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/spacex-starship-sn9-rocket-flies-high-explodes-on-landing-just-like-sn8/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-starlink-18-satellites-launch-rocket-landing">SpaceX launches 60 Starlink satellites on record-setting used rocket, nails landing</a></h2>

<p><em>"SpaceX launched 60 more Starlink internet satellites to orbit this morning (Feb. 4) on a mission that notched a booster-reusability milestone for the company. A two-stage Falcon 9 rocket topped with the 60 broadband spacecraft lifted off from Space Launch Complex 40 here at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station today at 1:19 a.m. EST (0619 GMT). Approximately nine minutes later, the rocket's first stage returned to Earth, landing smoothly on one of SpaceX's drone ships in the Atlantic Ocean. The massive ship, "Of Course I Still Love You," is one of two SpaceX vessels that catch falling boosters and return them to port. It was the fifth launch for this Falcon 9 first stage, which last flew just 27 days ago — the quickest turnaround between missions for any SpaceX booster. Today's launch was also the first of two nearly back-to-back Starlink liftoffs; another 60 satellites are scheduled to take flight early Friday morning (Feb. 5) on a different Falcon 9."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-starlink-18-satellites-launch-rocket-landing">[...]</a>

<p><em>"We’re thrilled to say bonjour to the Dunant submarine cable system, which has been deployed and tested and is now ready for service. Crossing the Atlantic Ocean between Virginia Beach in the U.S. and Saint-Hilaire-de-Riez on the French Atlantic coast, the system expands Google’s global network to add dedicated capacity, diversity, and resilience, while enabling interconnection to other network infrastructure in the region. It’s named in honor of Swiss businessman and social activist Henry Dunant, the founder of the Red Cross and first recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. The historic landing was made possible in partnership with SubCom, a global partner for undersea data transport, which engineered, manufactured and installed the Dunant system on schedule despite the ongoing global pandemic. Delivering record-breaking capacity of 250 terabits per second (Tbps) across the Atlantic As we shared when we originally announced the Dunant cable, Dunant is the first long-haul subsea cable to feature a 12 fiber pair space-division multiplexing (SDM) design, and will deliver record-breaking capacity of 250 terabits per second (Tbps) across the ocean—enough to transmit the entire digitized Library of Congress three times every second. Increased cable capacity is delivered in a cost-effective manner with additional fiber pairs (twelve, rather than six or eight in past generations of subsea cables) and power-optimized repeater designs."</em> <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure/googles-dunant-subsea-cable-is-now-ready-for-service">[...]</a>

<p><em>"For many, the term “autonomous vehicles” conjures up images of self-driving cars. Autonomy, however, is transforming much more than personal transportation. Autonomous trucks are commercial vehicles that use AI to automate everything from shipping yard operations to long-haul deliveries. Due to industry pressures from rising delivery demand and driver shortages, as well as straightforward operational domains such as highways, these intelligent trucks may be the first autonomous vehicles to hit public roads at scale. This technology uses long-range, high-resolution sensors, a range of deep neural networks and high-performance, energy-efficient compute to improve safety and efficiency for everyday logistics. With the rise of e-commerce and next-day delivery, trucking plays an increasingly vital role in moving the world forward."</em> <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/02/04/what-is-autonomous-truck/">[...]</a>

Army researchers built the quantum sensor, which can sample the radio-frequency spectrum—from zero frequency up to 20 GHz—and detect AM and FM radio, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and other communication signals. The Rydberg sensor uses laser beams to create highly-excited Rydberg atoms directly above a microwave circuit, to boost and hone in on the portion of the spectrum being measured. The Rydberg atoms are sensitive to the circuit’s voltage, enabling the device to be used as a sensitive probe for the wide range of signals in the RF spectrum. “All previous demonstrations of Rydberg atomic sensors have only been able to sense small and specific regions of the RF spectrum, but our sensor now operates continuously over a wide frequency range for the first time,” said Dr. Kevin Cox, a researcher at the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command, now known as DEVCOM, Army Research Laboratory. “This is a really important step toward proving that quantum sensors can provide a new, and dominant, set of capabilities for our Soldiers, who are operating in an increasingly complex electro-magnetic battlespace.” The Rydberg spectrum analyzer has the potential to surpass fundamental limitations of traditional electronics in sensitivity, bandwidth and frequency range."</em> <a href="https://www.army.mil/article/242980/army_researchers_detect_broadest_frequencies_ever_with_quantum_receiver">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Physicists use atomic magnetometers to measure the biomagnetic signals of the carnivorous plant The Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) is a carnivorous plant that encloses its prey using modified leaves as a trap. During this process, electrical signals known as action potentials trigger the closure of the leaf lobes. An interdisciplinary team of scientists has now shown that these electrical signals generate measurable magnetic fields. Using atomic magnetometers, it proved possible to record this biomagnetism. "You could say the investigation is a little like performing an MRI scan in humans," said physicist Anne Fabricant. "The problem is that the magnetic signals in plants are very weak, which explains why it was extremely difficult to measure them with the help of older technologies.""</em> <a href="https://www.uni-mainz.de/presse/aktuell/13025_ENG_HTML.php">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Using salt as a key ingredient, Chinese and British researchers have designed a new type of rechargeable battery that could accelerate the shift to greener, electric transport on our roads. Many electric vehicles (EV) are powered by rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, but they can lose energy and power over time. Under certain conditions, such batteries can also overheat while working or charging, which can also degrade battery life and reduce miles per charge. To solve these issues, the University of Nottingham is collaborating with six scientific research institutes across China to develop an innovative and affordable energy store with the combined performance merits of a solid-oxide fuel cell and a metal-air battery. The new battery could significantly extend the range of electric vehicles, while being fully recyclable, environmentally-friendly, low-cost and safe. A solid-oxide fuel cell converts hydrogen and oxygen into electricity as a result of a chemical reaction."</em> <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/salt-battery-that-helps-electric-cars-go-the-extra-mile">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Physicists have discovered a potentially game changing feature of quantum bit behaviour which would allow scientists to simulate complex quantum systems without the need for enormous computing power. For some time, the development of the next generation of quantum computer has limited by the processing speed of conventional CPUs. Even the world’s fastest supercomputers have not been powerful enough, and existing quantum computers are still too small, to be able to model moderate-sized quantum structures, such as quantum processors. However, a team of researchers from the University of Nottingham's School of Physics &amp; Astronomy and Loughborough and Innopolis universities have now found a way to bypass the need for such massive amounts of power by harnessing the chaotic behaviour of qubits - the smallest unit of digital information. When modelling the behaviour of quantum bits (qubits) they found that when an external energy source, such as a laser or microwave signal, was used the system became more chaotic – eventually demonstrating the phenomenon known as hyperchaos. When the qubits were excited by the power source they switched states, like regular computer bits which shift between 0 and 1, but in a much more irregular and unpredictable way."</em> <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/physicists-use-hyperchaos-to-model-complex-quantum-systems-at-a-fraction-of-the-computing-power">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Structure may reveal conditions needed for high-temperature superconductivity. When two sheets of graphene are stacked atop each other at just the right angle, the layered structure morphs into an unconventional superconductor, allowing electric currents to pass through without resistance or wasted energy. This “magic-angle” transformation in bilayer graphene was observed for the first time in 2018 in the group of Pablo Jarillo-Herrero, the Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Physics at MIT. Since then, scientists have searched for other materials that can be similarly twisted into superconductivity, in the emerging field of “twistronics.” For the most part, no other twisted material has exhibited superconductivity other than the original twisted bilayer graphene, until now. In a paper appearing today in Nature, Jarillo-Herrero and his group report observing superconductivity in a sandwich of three graphene sheets, the middle layer of which is twisted at a new angle with respect to the outer layers.

This artform is actually a little difficult to get into if you haven't tried, so I decided to make a platform for lighting some LEDs to start with while I improve my ability to solder brass and copper wires. Supplies: Equipment: - Soldering Iron - Solder - File (to file down the brass wires) Parts (Per Board): 8x - 22uF capacitors (can be larger) 7x - Transistors (2N3904 is fine) 7x - 33kOhm resistors (can be changed based on capacitor) 7x - 220Ohm resistors 1x - Button Battery Cell Clip 1x - On/Off Switch For the Sculptures: 7x - 5mm LEDs - Brass wire or copper wire"</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Circuit-Board-for-Making-Freeform-Circuit-Sculptur/">[...]</a>

A probe equipped with a Hall effect sensor is placed near or on top of the counter; the digit revolves when the gas flows and so does the magnet which becomes periodicaly detectable by the sensor. Keeping track of revolutions over time allows to calculate the amount of gas consumed during a certain period. While this project has been designed with gas meters in mind, it could theoretically work with other meters, such as water meters, as long as they have a detectable magnet moving along one of the indicators.

Trackers minimally consist of a GPS receiver feeding the current position to a small computer, which in turn controls a radio transmitter to send that position to the ground. That position is then fed to a live map to aid chasing and recovering the flight. This essential role of the tracker computer is thus a simple one, and those making their own trackers can choose from a variety of microcontrollers chips and boards, for example Arduino boards, PIC microcontrollers or the BBC Microbit. Anything with a modest amount of code memory, data memory, processor power and I/O (serial, SPI etc depending on choice of GPS and radio) will do. A popular choice is Raspberry Pi, which, whilst a sledgehammer to crack a nut for tracking, does make it easy to add a camera."</em> <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-pico-balloon-tracker/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/how-to-add-a-reset-button-to-your-raspberry-pi-pico/">How to add a reset button to your Raspberry Pi Pico</a></h2>

<p><em>"We’ve tried to make it as easy as possible for you to load your code onto your new Raspberry Pi Pico: press and hold the BOOTSEL button, plug your Pico into your computer, and it’ll mount as a mass storage volume. Then just drag and drop a UF2 file onto the board. However, not everybody is keen to keep unplugging their micro USB cable every time they want to upload a UF2 onto the board. Don’t worry — there’s more than one way around that problem. Firstly, if you’re developing in MicroPython there isn’t any real need to unplug and replug Pico to write code. The only time you’ll need to do it is the initial upload of the MicroPython firmware, which comes as a UF2."</em> <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/how-to-add-a-reset-button-to-your-raspberry-pi-pico/">[...]</a>
