<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1896, a química alemã <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ida_Noddack">Ida Noddack</a>. Ela, conjuntamente com  Walter Noddack e Otto Berg descobriram em 1925 o elemento 75, o rénio, ao qual foi dado o nome do rio Reno. Eles encontraram vestígios no mineral columbite. Eles também estavam a tentar encontrar o elemento 43, que eles chamaram de masurium, mas o anúncio dessa descoberta foi errado. Ela comentou sobre a possibilidade de fissão ao ouvir os relatórios das observações de Fermi de 1934 sobre o bombardeamento de neutrões de urânio. A sua ideia permaneceu adormecida. Porém, quando Frisch, cinco anos depois, apresentou a mesma ideia, ela foi aceita. Na fotoquímica, os Noddack trabalharam na sensibilização de substâncias corantes, a fotoquímica do olho humano entre outros.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1909, o físico soviético <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Artsimovich">Lev Artsimovich</a>. Ele ficou conhecido por ter criado a base do Tokamak, um dispositivo capaz de confinar plasma em temperatura ultra-alta, adequado para pesquisas em fusão nuclear controlada. Após a Segunda Guerra Mundial, ele começou com a tarefa de separação de isótopos para combustível de bomba nuclear e, a partir daí, passou a trabalhar com o objectivo de fusão nuclear controlada.</p>

<p>Na semana que passou, o rover Perseverance aterrou em Marte para uma serie de experiências e a bordo deste aterrou também o drone Ingenuity. Este drone foi construído com peças disponíveis no mercado, incluindo o processador Snapdragon 801 da Qualcomm, um chip de smartphone e tem como sistema operativo o Linux. Trata-se de uma novidade em termos de missões espaciais a Marte com equipamentos geridos por este sistema. Habitualmente recorrem a sistemas proprietários, no entanto face à escolha do Hardware a melhor opção era o Linux como sistema operativo.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou a sonda chinesa Tianwen-1 entrou na órbita de Marte e representa o esforço ambicioso da China para fazer inovações. Esta sonda vai passar cerca de três meses a realizar pesquisas científicas na órbita  estacionária.</p>

<p>Também relacionada com Marte a ultima noticia que destaco é a da divulgação das imagens da aterragem do rover Perseverance na superfície de Marte cujo para-quedas continha uma mensagem secreta, graças a um amante de quebra-cabeças da equipe da NASA. Os engenheiros queriam um padrão fora do comum nas listras laranjas e brancas do pára-quedas de nylon de 21 metros para que pudessem ver como ele foi orientado durante a descida do Perseverance ao Planeta Vermelho. O engenheiro de sistemas e adepto das palavras cruzadas Ian Clark teve a ideia, há dois anos, de usar um código binário para soletrar uma mensagem oculta: "Dare Mighty Things". É uma linha do ex-presidente dos Estados Unidos Theodore Roosevelt e a mantra do Jet Propulsion Laboratory, que está a executar o projecto Perseverance.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker assim como alguns videos interessantes. É apresentada a revista MagPI  nº 103 de Março e os livros "Dapr for .NET Developers", "Modeling and Simulation in Python" e "Computer Science I".</p>

<p><em>"Previous NASA Mars rovers mostly used an operating system from Wind River Systems. But this time, the space agency chose Linux for Perseverance's Ingenuity helicopter drone. When NASA’s Perseverance rover landed on Mars this week, it also brought the Linux operating system to the Red Planet. The tidbit was mentioned in an interview NASA software engineer Tim Canham gave to IEEE Spectrum. The helicopter-like drone on board the Perseverance rover uses a Linux-powered software framework the space agency open-sourced a few years ago. “This the first time we’ll be flying Linux on Mars."</em> <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/linux-is-now-on-mars-thanks-to-nasas-perseverance-rover">[...]</a>

<p><em>"China’s first Mars exploration mission Tianwen-1 successfully slowed down for the third time near Mars at 06:29 a.m. on Feb. 24 Beijing time and entered the Mars parking orbit. The Mars probe will spend about three months conducting scientific surveys in the parking orbit. Earlier on Feb. 10 Beijing time, the Tianwen-1 Mars probe reached the orbit around Mars after traveling in space for 202 days, becoming the country’s first man-made satellite of Mars. Tianwen-1 probe embarked on its journey to Mars on July 23, 2020. After flying 475 million km in space, the spacecraft conducted a “braking” operation to decelerate and make sure it would be captured by Mars’ gravity, and then started to orbit the red planet. The successful completion of such key steps during the space voyage laid a solid foundation for the Mars exploration mission of China."</em> <a href="http://en.people.cn/n3/2021/0225/c90000-9821936.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The huge parachute used by NASA's Perseverance rover to land on Mars contained a secret message, thanks to a puzzle-lover on the spacecraft team — and space lovers solved it within hours. Engineers wanted an unusual pattern in the orange and white stripes of the 21-metre nylon parachute so they'd be able to see how it was oriented during Perseverance's descent to the Red Planet. Systems engineer and crossword hobbyist Ian Clark came up with the idea two years ago to use a binary code to spell out a hidden message: "Dare Mighty Things". It's a line from former US president Theodore Roosevelt and a mantra of Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is running the Perseverance project. The message adorns many of the walls of JPL's mission headquarters in Pasadena, California. Mr Clark's message also included GPS coordinates to a spot just 3 metres from JPL's visitor centre."</em> <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2021-02-24/mars-nasa-perseverance-rover-parachute-carried-secret-message/13187476">[...]</a>

Early observations with Webb will demonstrate its ability to distinguish the individual light of stars in the local universe in a range of environments and provide astronomers with tools for making the most of Webb’s powerful capabilities. “NASA’s Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes have been transformative, opening the door to the infrared universe, beyond the realm of red visible light. Webb is a natural evolution of those missions, combining Spitzer’s view of the infrared universe with Hubble’s sensitivity and resolution,” says Daniel Weisz of the University of California, Berkeley, the principal investigator on Webb’s early release science (ERS) program on resolved populations of stars. Webb’s ability to resolve individual stars that are shrouded behind gas and dust in visible light will be applicable to many areas of astronomical research."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2021/nasa-s-webb-telescope-will-show-us-more-stars-at-higher-resolution-here-s-what-that-means">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Simulation of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics using a quantum computer goes beyond centuries old conventions Aalto researchers have used an IBM quantum computer to explore an overlooked area of physics, and have challenged 100 year old cherished notions about information at the quantum level. The rules of quantum physics – which govern how very small things behave – use mathematical operators called Hermitian Hamiltonians. Hermitian operators have underpinned quantum physics for nearly 100 years but recently, theorists have realized that it is possible to extend its fundamental equations to making use of operators that are not Hermitian. The new equations describe a universe with its own peculiar set of rules: for example, by looking in the mirror and reversing the direction of time you should see the same version of you as in the actual world. In their new paper, a team of researchers led by Docent Sorin Paraoanu used a quantum computer to create a toy-universe that behaves according to these new rules.

<p><em>"Reducing internal losses could pave the way to low-cost perovskite-based photovoltaics that match silicon cells’ output. Perovskites are a leading candidate for eventually replacing silicon as the material of choice for solar panels. They offer the potential for low-cost, low-temperature manufacturing of ultrathin, lightweight flexible cells, but so far their efficiency at converting sunlight to electricity has lagged behind that of silicon and some other alternatives. Now, a new approach to the design of perovskite cells has pushed the material to match or exceed the efficiency of today’s typical silicon cell, which generally ranges from 20 to 22 percent, laying the groundwork for further improvements. By adding a specially treated conductive layer of tin dioxide bonded to the perovskite material, which provides an improved path for the charge carriers in the cell, and by modifying the perovskite formula, researchers have boosted its overall efficiency as a solar cell to 25.2 percent — a near-record for such materials, which eclipses the efficiency of many existing solar panels.

To achieve this key step toward commercialization, the report calls for an aggressive public-private effort to produce by 2028 a pilot plant design that can, when built, accommodate any of the developmental approaches seeking to realize fusion’s potential as a safe, carbon-free, on-demand energy source.

<p><em>"A team of researchers designed and manufactured a new sodium-ion conductor for solid-state sodium-ion batteries that is stable when incorporated into higher-voltage oxide cathodes. This new solid electrolyte could dramatically improve the efficiency and lifespan of this class of batteries. A proof of concept battery built with the new material lasted over 1000 cycles while retaining 89.3% of its capacity—a performance unmatched by other solid-state sodium batteries to date. Researchers detail their findings in the Feb. 23, 2021 issue of Nature Communications. Solid state batteries hold the promise of safer, cheaper, and longer lasting batteries. Sodium-ion chemistries are particularly promising because sodium is low-cost and abundant, as opposed to the lithium required for lithium-ion batteries, which is mined at a high environmental cost."</em> <a href="https://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/new-material-is-next-step-toward-stable-high-voltage-long-life-solid-state-sodium-ion-batteries">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Unexpected twist in the Kibble-Zurek theory offers a new approach to solving two famous physics problems regarding matter/antimatter asymmetry and isotope separation A team of quantum theorists seeking to cure a basic problem with quantum annealing computers—they have to run at a relatively slow pace to operate properly—found something intriguing instead. While probing how quantum annealers perform when operated faster than desired, the team unexpectedly discovered a new effect that may account for the imbalanced distribution of matter and antimatter in the universe and a novel approach to separating isotopes. “Although our discovery did not cure the annealing time restriction, it brought a class of new physics problems that can now be studied with quantum annealers without requiring they be too slow,” said Nikolai Sinitsyn, a theoretical physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Sinitsyn is author of the paper published Feb. 19 in Physical Review Letters, with coauthors Bin Yan and Wojciech Zurek, both also of Los Alamos, and Vladimir Chernyak of Wayne State University. Significantly, this finding hints at how at least two famous scientific problems may be resolved in the future.

<p><em>"The breakthrough combines excellent electromagnetic shielding with ease of manufacture and electrical isolation As electronic devices saturate all corners of public and personal life, engineers are scrambling to find lightweight, mechanically stable, flexible, and easily manufactured materials that can shield humans from excessive electromagnetic radiation as well as prevent electronic devices from interfering with each other. In a breakthrough report published in Advanced Materials—the top journal in the field— engineers at the University of California, Riverside describe a flexible film using a quasi-one-dimensional nanomaterial filler that combines excellent electromagnetic shielding with ease of manufacture. “These novel films are promising for high-frequency communication technologies, which require electromagnetic interference shielding films that are flexible, lightweight, corrosion resistant, inexpensive, and electrically insulating,” said senior author Alexander A. Balandin, a distinguished professor of electrical and computer engineering at UC Riverside’s Marlan and Rosemary Bourns College of Engineering. “They couple strongly to high-frequency radiofrequency radiation while remaining electrically insulating in direct current measurements.” Electromagnetic interference, or EMI, occurs when signals from different electronic devices cross each other, affecting performance. The signal from a cell phone or laptop WiFi, or even a kitchen blender, might cause static to appear on a TV screen, for example. Likewise, airlines instruct passengers to turn off cellphones during landing and takeoff because their signals can disrupt navigation signals."</em> <a href="https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2021/02/22/polymer-film-protects-electromagnetic-radiation-signal-interference">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Using the IBM Q computer, physicists at EPFL have verified for the first time the tight relationship between quantum entanglement and wave-particle duality, showing that the former controls the latter in a quantum system. “It is possible to do experiments in fundamental physics on the remotely accessible IBM Q quantum computer,” says Marc-André Dupertuis, a physicist at EPFL’s School of Basic Sciences. Working with Nicolas Schwaller, a Master student in Physics at EPFL, and Clément Javerzac-Galy, co-CEO of photonics company Miraex, the three scientists carried out their work by studying a system made of two separate quantum elements, represented in the IBM Q as superconducting quantum bits. EPFL already has a longstanding relationship with IBM’s famed quantum computer, with two teams of students placing second in the annual “IBM Q competition” in 2018 and 2020. The work is published in Physical Reviews A. “We were able to indirectly confirm that the duality of each quantum bit can be turned off completely, or set to any desired amount by controlling the degree of entanglement of the pair,” says Dupertuis."</em> <a href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/ibm-s-quantum-computer-links-two-quantum-revolutio/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A team of researchers led by Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore) has developed a new material, that when electricity is applied to it, can flex and bend forty times more than its competitors, opening the way to better micro machines. Conversely, when it is bent, it generates electricity very effectively and could be used for better “energy harvesting” – potentially recharging batteries in gadgets just from everyday movements. The novel material is both electrostrictive and piezoelectric. Its electrostrictive properties means it can change shape when an electric current is applied, while piezoelectric means the material can convert pressure into electric charges. When an electric field is applied, the atoms that make up electrostrictive materials shift, causing the material to deform and flex. When piezoelectrics are compressed, the pressure is converted to electric charges which accumulate in the material."</em> <a href="https://media.ntu.edu.sg/NewsReleases/Pages/newsdetail.aspx?news=92167e63-6962-46d6-ae15-9b032516c70d">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore), Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) and Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH) have developed a new way to create “food inks” from fresh and frozen vegetables, that preserves their nutrition and flavour better than existing methods. Food inks are usually made from pureed foods in liquid or semi-solid form, then 3D-printed by extrusion from a nozzle, and assembled layer by layer. Pureed foods are usually served to patients suffering from swallowing difficulties known as dysphagia. To present the food in a more visually appetising way, healthcare professionals have used silicone moulds to shape pureed foods, which is labour and time intensive, and requires storage. While 3D food printing means food can be easily produced in a desired shape and texture in a shorter time, the dehydrated food and freeze-dried powders used as food inks usually contain a high percentage of food additives such as hydrocolloids (HCs) to stabilise the ink and enable a smoother printing process. High concentration of hydrocolloids usually changes the taste, texture and aroma of the printed food, making it unappetising to patients with dysphagia."</em> <a href="https://media.ntu.edu.sg/NewsReleases/Pages/newsdetail.aspx?news=6d9062a9-8ced-4545-ba2d-0761f06fc774&amp;fbclid=IwAR3To5Gfdum3CT5ZwOGolQIQqgdDezKw482DUw9j2meeThM9qCiho7j7Y-s">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scientists investigate how a self-repairing polymer can vastly improve the durability of a promising anode material for high-capacity batteries Although silicon anodes could greatly boost the capacity of Li-ion batteries, their performance rapidly degrades with use. Polymeric coatings can help solve this problem, but very few studies have explored the underlying mechanisms. In a recent study, scientists from Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology investigate how a poly(borosiloxane) coating greatly stabilizes the capacity of silicon anodes, paving the way for better and more durable Li-ion batteries for electric cars and renewable energy harvesting. Since their conception, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been constantly improved and adapted so that they can become suitable for vastly different applications, from mobile devices and electric cars to storage units for renewable energy harvesters. In most larger-scale applications (such as the latter two), the focus of LIB research is placed on increasing their capacity and voltage limits without increasing their overall size. Of course, for that to be possible, the components and materials of the battery must be switched up."</em> <a href="https://www.jaist.ac.jp/english/whatsnew/press/2021/02/09-1.html">[...]</a>

These microservices are both stateless and stateful, and run on the cloud and edge, embracing the diversity of languages and frameworks available today. This enterprise shift is driven by both the market forces of faster time to market, as well as the scale and efficiencies of building services for the cloud. Even before COVID-19, cloud adoption was accelerating for enterprises and developers were being asked to do even more to deliver on building these distributed system applications, and that has only accelerated since. Developers in enterprises seek to focus on business logic, while leaning on platforms to imbue their applications with scale, resiliency, maintainability, elasticity, and the other attributes of cloud-native architectures, which is why there is also shift towards serverless platforms that hide the underlying infrastructure.

These basic types tend to be of low capacitance, polystyrene film being an example with capacitance of &lt;=10nF and single layer ceramic up to ~1uF. Variants of these forms exist using different dielectrics and construction for a variety of different uses. Beyond the basic forms are the polarised (Electrolytic), types which employ a gel or liquid electrolyte with capacitance up to ~1F, used in coupling, decoupling, supply and timing applications."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Microbit-Capacitance-Meter/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This project originated from a request of a friend. He asked me to build a so-called smile counter for their college dorm - a segmented display which can show a number. This number must increment every time someone pushed a button and should be memorized even if power goes out. The counter was counting smiles: every time a tenant would pass it by and was in a good mood, happy, smiling or anything in between, they would hit the button. In order to have a processing unit as simple as it can get (and to consume a few of the salvaged ICs I had, and still have on stock), I decided to build this using counters, decoders and buffers - at least on digit level.

<p><em>"Calescere is a culmination of ideas and projects Majenta and Erika have been developing over the last couple of years. When Erika was asked to develop a concept for an interactive audio recording studio lobby, she and Majenta envisioned a space ripe with passive and active synchronized interfaces, these would seamlessly be integrated into the lobby’s furniture, floors, and walls, and they would control the ambient audio experience in the space. Imagine walking into a lobby where the ambient music is controlled by the footsteps of the people around you, the nervous tapping of the person waiting in the chair, the excited swaying of the artist leaning against the wall. More recently, at CES 2020 Majenta and Maddy, Loomia Founder, discussed how heated furniture has the potential to be a more sustainable strategy for heating in homes. We’ve seen through individualization of personal electronics (an app for everything evolving into now a device for every app), the appreciation of glowing aroma diffusers (sometimes combined with audio experiences), and through the design style of Google home and other products, that people are interested in interactive hardware experiences that go beyond the same rectangular touch screens over and over.

Quartz oscillators were introduced in the 1920s and provided accurate frequencies for radio stations. Wristwatches were revolutionized in the 1970s by the use of highly-accurate quartz oscillators. Computers use quartz oscillators to generate their clock signals, from ENIAC in the 1940s to modern computers.1 A quartz crystal requires additional circuitry to make it oscillate, and this analog circuitry can be tricky to design."</em> <a href="http://www.righto.com/2021/02/teardown-of-quartz-crystal-oscillator.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Self-learning UHF receiver consisting of a radio receiver board with Motorola decoding and a module equipped with 8 relays operating in impulse or bistable mode. In many home automation applications and in general where it is necessary to exercise remote control by radio of multiple devices installed in the same place, the classic single and dual-channel handheld transmitters are not particularly practical, because using common radio controls (TX/RX) should be installed more than one receiver, with an obvious increase in cost, space and complexity, since each receiver unit has redundant parts that could be pooled: for example the RF receiver. This is why it would be useful to have a single radio control system and, in particular, a receiver unit that supports all the channels required by the system; an example is a receiver described in these pages, which allows the remote management, via AM radio links at 433.92 MHz, of 8 users manageable with the clean contact of one relay each. It is, therefore, a radio control system in which we can combine a receiver with eight outputs, a single eight-channel transmitter, two four-channel, four two-channel, or eight single-channel transmitters, or combinations of them because the beauty of the receiver is that it learns the code regardless of which transmitter it comes from. Thanks to a suitable relay interface, the receiver can switch users either operating at low DC voltage or at 230Vac mains voltage, which absorbs up to 10 amps each. The coding used is the Motorola MC14502x standard, so it allows a maximum of 19,683 combinations for each channel unless you use multi-channel TX; in fact, in this case, the combinations must be divided by the total number of channels, but this limit is not derived from the receiver (which, as we will see, treats each code individually, regardless of the type of transmitter that generates it) but rather from the encoder of the transmitter."</em> <a href="https://www.open-electronics.org/433-mhz-receiver-8-channels-with-self-learning/">[...]</a>

If you do not know how a phenakistoscope works, you may visit https://youtu.be/r4B3FHHt_k8 to see one in action. It may be amazing to watch the mirror reflected images come to life by peeking through the slits or slots of phenakistoscopes, however, it can be quite tiresome when viewing for an extended period of time. In this instructable, we are going to build a modern phenakistoscope."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/A-Modern-Take-on-the-Phenakistoscope/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"I’ve been reading about the Oskitone 555Poly which looks like a lot of fun. It is a fully polyphonic sound generator based on one 555 oscillator circuit per key, each one individually tuned to the note you want it to play. Unfortunately my budget for making is unlikely to be able to justify getting one myself, but the full development, build and design details are available on github here and it makes for fascinating reading. This project is not attempting to “build my own” but I was inspired by the idea of an oscillator per key and so I thought I’d spectacularly miss the point of the Oskitone and attempt to use a microcontroller to give me a tunable oscillator output for as many keys as I could manage. In the process, I’ve managed full 12-note polyphony (as long as you only need 12 notes in total) on an Arduino Uno. Here is how it works."</em> <a href="https://diyelectromusic.wordpress.com/2021/02/05/arduino-tone-polyphony/">[...]</a>

In the video I go over the process in the code and demonstrate the end result. In order to explain the calibration process we need to go over some basic things. The received data from the hx711 is a 24bit resolution analog to digital read. In order to know what’s that in pounds or in kilo, we need to have a ratio factor. So If we read the data from the hx711 then place 3Kg on the scale and read the data again, the delta divided by 3 will give us that ratio factor we need."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/talofer99/auto-calibrate-hx711-scale-with-known-weight-7ae97d">[...]</a>

<p><em>"With a cheap piezo buzzer, you can set alarms or play whole tunes. Whether you’re building a game that beeps when you lose a turn, an alarm clock that wakes you up or just a cute display that plays 8-bit music, a low-cost piezo buzzer can be a great part of your Raspberry Pi Pico project. The extremely-cheap buzzers -- you can often find them for less than $1 apiece -- are dead-simple to program in MicroPython and can even vary the frequency to produce musical notes. There are two types of piezo buzzers: active and passive. Active buzzers will make noise if they are just hooked up to power with no microcontroller involved while passive ones will not. Passive buzzers are preferred for this kind of project because they offer a better range of sounds, though in our testing, both worked."</em> <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/buzzer-music-raspberry-pi-pico">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Introduction In this project we will build a simple USB MIDI plug-and-play breath controller. It is designed using easy to find cheap components so that the total cost remains affordable and well below commercial equivalents. This is the basic version that only uses the air pressure sensor but the plan is to upgrade it to include a bite and nod/tilt sensor in the future. The project assumes some very basic electronics and Arduino knowledge but even a beginner can build it as there is no soldering involved. Of course more advanced users can solder everything on a perma-protoboard. I am not covering installation of the IDE/libraries and instructions to upload code as there are excellent tutorials on the internet."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/costis/arduino-breath-controller-for-cheap-usb-midi-fe3a8f">[...]</a>

Below we described steps needed to understand how the solution has been programmed to design the audio amplifier. However, if you just want to get the result of programming, download GreenPAK software to view the already completed GreenPAK Design File.

<p><em>"The new RP2040 microcontroller from Raspberry Pi Foundation has a powerful feature: the PIO module, a sort of accelerated I/O processor. In this guide, you will learn how you can use CircuitPython and PIO together to drive 8 separate NeoPixel LED strands using just 3 GPIO pins and a 74HC595 Shift Register. One advantage of driving your NeoPixel LEDs this way is that less time is spent actually sending the pixel data to the LEDs—It is about 7.5x faster to show() your NeoPixels with the parallel method. Depending on your project, having parallel strips as opposed to chained strips can also make for better wiring. Mostly, this guide is just a cool way to show off some of the capabilities of PIO itself.
