<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1742, o químico sueco <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Wilhelm_Scheele">Carl Wilhelm Scheele</a>. Ele foi responsável pela descoberta do oxigénio em 1772. Scheele, um experimentador apurado, trabalhou em condições difíceis e muitas vezes perigosas. No seu único livro, Observações Químicas e Experiências sobre o Ar e o Fogo (1777), ele declarou que a atmosfera é composta por dois gases, um de apoio à combustão, que ele chamou "ar de fogo" (oxigénio), e o outro de prevenção, que ele chamou "ar viciado" (nitrogénio). Devido ao atraso na sua publicação, perdeu a prioridade à descoberta de oxigénio por parte de Priestley em 1774. Scheele descobriu muitas substâncias, tais como o cloro (1774), manganês (1774), tungsténio (1781), molibdénio (1782), glicerol, ácido cianídrico (prussic), ácido cítrico, sulfureto de hidrogénio e fluoreto de hidrogénio. Descobriu também um processo que se assemelha à pasteurização.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1839, o matemático alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Roch">Gustav Roch</a>. Ele deu contribuições significativas para a teoria das superfícies de Riemann.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1868, o Químico e físico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Haber">Fritz Haber</a>. Foi-lhe atribuido o Prémio Nobel da Química (1918) pelo seu desenvolvimento de um método de síntese de amoníaco (1909) directamente a partir do nitrogénio e hidrogénio. Isto levou à produção comercial em larga escala de fertilizante de azoto. Com a perícia de Carl Bosch, um químico que trabalha na Badische Anilin- und Soda- Fabrik (BASF), os obstáculos que impediram a adopção em larga escala do processo foram ultrapassados e o processo Haber-Bosch nasceu. O processo de alta pressão Haber-Bosch seguiu-se na década de 1920. Haber foi também responsável pela introdução de gases venenosos para a guerra química na I Guerra Mundial. Sendo judeu, deixou a Alemanha em 1933 para se exilar na Grã-Bretanha, trabalhando em Cambridge no Laboratório Cavendish.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1906, a matemática norte-americana <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">Grace Hopper</a>. Ela foi pioneira no desenvolvimento da tecnologia informática. Ajudou John Presper Eckert e John William Mauchly na concepção e desenvolvimento do BINAC (Computador Automático Binário). As suas ideias contribuíram para o primeiro computador electrónico comercial, Univac I, e aplicações navais para COBOL (co-mmon b-usiness o-riented l-anguage). Com um doutoramento em Matemática pela Universidade de Yale (1934), ensinou matemática (Vassar, 1931-43), antes de entrar para a Reserva Naval. Em 1944, foi contratada como Tenente (Junior Grade), destacada para o Bureau of Ordnance, onde se envolveu no desenvolvimento precoce do computador electrónico. Durante mais de quatro décadas, foi líder em aplicações informáticas e linguagens de programação.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1917, o físico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Rainwater">James Rainwater</a>. Ele ganhou uma parte do Prémio Nobel da Física em 1975 pela sua parte na determinação das formas assimétricas de certos núcleos atómicos. Durante a II Guerra Mundial, Rainwater trabalhou no Projecto Manhattan para desenvolver a bomba atómica. Em 1949 começou a formular uma teoria de que nem todos os núcleos atómicos são esféricos, como então se acreditava geralmente. A teoria foi testada experimentalmente e confirmada pelos físicos dinamarqueses Aage N. Bohr e Ben R. Mottelson. Pelo seu trabalho, os três cientistas receberam conjuntamente o Prémio Nobel da Física de 1975. Também realizou valiosas pesquisas sobre os raios X e participou em projectos de investigação da Comissão de Energia Atómica e naval.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1919, o químico e físico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lipscomb">William Lipscomb</a>. Ele ganhou o Prémio Nobel da Química em 1976 pela sua investigação sobre a estrutura dos boranos (compostos de hidreto de boro), trabalho que também respondeu a questões gerais sobre a ligação química. Os boranos tornaram-se importantes na investigação química nos anos 40 e 50 devido à necessidade de encontrar compostos de urânio voláteis (boroidridos) para a separação de isótopos, bem como à necessidade de desenvolver combustíveis de alta energia para foguetes e aviões a jacto. Para mapear as estruturas moleculares dos boranos, Lipscomb desenvolveu também técnicas de raios X que mais tarde encontraram aplicação em muitas outras áreas de investigação química. Os interesses de investigação de Lipscomb incluíam a relação da estrutura tridimensional e mecanismos de enzimas e outras proteínas.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1926, o físico nuclear norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Way_Kendall">Henry Way Kendall</a>. Ele partilhou o Prémio Nobel da Física de 1990 com Jerome Isaac Friedman e Richard E. Taylor pela obtenção de provas experimentais da existência das partículas subatómicas conhecidas como quarks. Para estudar a estrutura interna do protão, trabalharam com o acelerador linear de 3 km recentemente inaugurado em Stanford (SLAC). Os electrões foram acelerados para uma energia de 20.000 milhões de electrões-volts e dirigidos contra um alvo de hidrogénio líquido. Em 1969, Kendall ajudou a fundar a União de Cientistas Preocupados. Em 1997, em ligação com a Cimeira do Clima de Quioto, ajudou a produzir uma declaração assinada por 2.000 cientistas apelando à acção sobre o aquecimento global.</p>

<p>Em 1968 era apresentado o primeiro rato para computador. Foi na Fall Joint Computer Conference da American Federation of Information Processing Societies na Universidade de Stanford, Califórnia. O inventor do rato, Doug Engelbart e uma pequena equipa de investigadores do Instituto de Investigação de Stanford abanaram o mundo informático com uma extraordinária demonstração numa conferência informática em São Francisco. Estrearam o rato de computador, a interface gráfica do utilizador, a edição de ecrã e textos e gráficos integrados, hiper-documentos, e vídeo-conferências de duas vias com espaços de trabalho partilhados. Estes conceitos e tecnologias deveriam tornar-se as pedras angulares da moderna computação interactiva. Engelbart patenteou o rato a 17 de Novembro de 1970.</p>

<p>Na semana que passou foi revelada uma fotografia tirada pelo rover chinês, o Yutu-2, de um objecto em forma de cubo na superfície da Lua. A equipa do rover está a planear passar mais perto do local para ver de perto o objecto.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker assim como alguns videos interessantes.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/china-moon-rover-will-investigate-cube-shaped-mystery-object-on-lunar-far-side/">China moon rover will investigate cube-shaped 'mystery' object on lunar far side</a></h2>

<p><em>"The Yutu-2 rover is on a roll. It's been exploring the far side of the moon since early 2019 as part of China's Chang'e-4 lunar lander mission. It now has its eyes set on a strange-looking cube-shaped object it spotted in the distance. Andrew Jones, a journalist who covers the Chinese space program for SpaceNews and Space.com, highlighted a new rover update in a series of tweets Friday. The nickname for the cube-shaped object translates to "mystery house." The rover team is planning to drive over and get a closer look at the object."</em> <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/china-moon-rover-will-investigate-cube-shaped-mystery-object-on-lunar-far-side/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-next-generation-asteroid-impact-monitoring-system-goes-online">NASA’s Next-Generation Asteroid Impact Monitoring System Goes Online</a></h2>

<p><em>"The new system improves the capabilities of NASA JPL’s Center for Near Earth Object Studies to assess the impact risk of asteroids that can come close to our planet. To date, nearly 28,000 near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) have been found by survey telescopes that continually scan the night sky, adding new discoveries at a rate of about 3,000 per year. But as larger and more advanced survey telescopes turbocharge the search over the next few years, a rapid uptick in discoveries is expected. In anticipation of this increase, NASA astronomers have developed a next-generation impact monitoring algorithm called Sentry-II to better evaluate NEA impact probabilities. Popular culture often depicts asteroids as chaotic objects that zoom haphazardly around our solar system, changing course unpredictably and threatening our planet without a moment’s notice. This is not the reality."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-next-generation-asteroid-impact-monitoring-system-goes-online">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A gigantic, "potentially hazardous" space rock bigger than the Eiffel Tower will enter Earth’s orbital path on Dec. 11, according to NASA. The egg-shaped asteroid, named 4660 Nereus, is 1,082 feet (330 meters) long and will break into Earth’s orbit traveling at 14,700 mph (23,700 km/h) on Saturday, Dec. 11. Thankfully for all of our weekend plans, the asteroid is expected to skim past Earth at some distance without making impact, but it will still be closer to us than it has been in 20 years.

<p><em>"High-precision 3D supercomputer simulations reveal the 3D structure of theoretically predicted micron-scale megatesla magnetic fields, optimizing engineering design of laser conditions and micron-size target structures for future laser experiments Recently, a research team at Osaka University has successfully demonstrated the generation of megatesla (MT)-order magnetic fields via three-dimensional particle simulations on laser-matter interaction. The strength of MT magnetic fields is 1-10 billion times stronger than geomagnetism (0.3-0.5 G), and these fields are expected to be observed only in the close vicinity of celestial bodies such as neutron stars or black holes. This result should facilitate an ambitious experiment to achieve MT-order magnetic fields in the laboratory, which is now in progress. Since the 19th century, scientists have strived to achieve the highest magnetic fields in the laboratory. To date, the highest magnetic field observed in the laboratory is in the kilotesla (kT)-order. In 2020, Masakatsu Murakami at Osaka University proposed a novel scheme called microtube implosions (MTI) [1, 2] to generate ultrahigh magnetic fields on the MT-order."</em> <a href="https://resou.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/research/2021/20211202_3">[...]</a>

These are just some of the potential applications that could emerge from optical engineering, the practice of using lasers to rapidly and temporarily change the properties of materials. "These tools could let you transform the electronic properties of materials at the flick of a light switch," says Caltech Professor of Physics David Hsieh. "But the technologies have been limited by the problem of the lasers creating too much heat in the materials." In a new study in Nature, Hsieh and his team, including lead author and graduate student Junyi Shan, report success at using lasers to dramatically sculpt the properties of materials without the production of any excess damaging heat. "The lasers required for these experiments are very powerful, so it's hard to not heat up and damage the materials," says Shan."</em> <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/transforming-materials-with-light">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Using 2D materials, researchers have built superconducting qubits that are a fraction of the size of previous qubits, paving the way for smaller quantum computers. For quantum computers to surpass their classical counterparts in speed and capacity, their qubits—which are superconducting circuits that can exist in an infinite combination of binary states—need to be on the same wavelength. Achieving this, however, has come at the cost of size. Whereas the transistors used in classical computers have been shrunk down to nanometer scales, superconducting qubits these days are still measured in millimeters—one millimeter is one million nanometers. Combine qubits together into larger and larger circuit chips, and you end up with, relatively speaking, a big physical footprint, which means quantum computers take up a lot of physical space.

Humans are pretty good at looking at a single two-dimensional image and understanding the full three-dimensional scene that it captures. Artificial intelligence agents are not. Yet a machine that needs to interact with objects in the world — like a robot designed to harvest crops or assist with surgery — must be able to infer properties about a 3D scene from observations of the 2D images it’s trained on. While scientists have had success using neural networks to infer representations of 3D scenes from images, these machine learning methods aren’t fast enough to make them feasible for many real-world applications.

<p><em>"This is easy to build and very useful project for hobbyists and students to learn and create OPAMP-based projects. The project accommodates a single OPAMP in the MSOP8 package. The project provides the user with multiple choices and extensive flexibility for different applications circuits and configurations. It provides the user with many combinations for various circuit types including active filters, differential amplifiers, and external frequency compensation circuits. A few examples of application circuits are given below. OP777 op-amp is the right choice to use or any other MSOP8 op-amp with the same pin configuration as OP777 can be used."</em> <a href="https://www.electronics-lab.com/project/universal-opamp-board-for-smd-msop8-package/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A solar-powered environmental monitoring system based on the Reyax LoRa module and Grandeur IoT Cloud platform for a smart city. Smart City &amp; Air Quality The World Bank defines a smart city as one that is a technology-intensive city. This means highly efficient public services. One of the fundamental features of smart cities is providing a sustainable environment. For a sustainable environment, it is necessary to monitor the environmental conditions for identifying the sources of pollution and mitigate them. In this context, thousands of air quality sensors are placed to provide real-time information to the government and citizens alike."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/taifur/lora-based-smart-city-air-quality-monitoring-3b5f1d">[...]</a>

<p><em>"After experimenting for many years with artificial muscles that are 3D printed, I have come up with a fairly efficient configuration of muscles and bones that can be printed in modular form. This allows for the muscles and supporting bone structures to be reconfigured in various ways to create many kinds of robots. This creates a kind of erector set that is plug and play--to make robots that are limited only by your own creativity. The most efficient pneumatic artificial muscle I have developed so far, I call the Omega muscle. Shaped like the omega sign, it is at once a muscle, a tendon, and a ligament that locks into a slot in a bone structure. It provides maximum expansion or rotational movement while occupying a small volume at rest."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/3D-Printed-Artificial-Muscles-Erector-Set/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A wireless MIDI controller for an acoustic guitar's pickguard that detects note presses via capacitive touch sensing. I perform and record fingerstyle guitar music and wanted a way to control a software synthesizer during live performances. This would allow me to perform more complex arrangements and diversify my sound. The simplest way I could think of doing this was by adding a MIDI controller to the pickguard (known as a scratchplate in the UK) of my guitar. This is in a convenient place for fingerstyle players as the picking hand rests close to this region of the guitar in most fingerstyle techniques. Capacitive touch sensing was used as it allows larger contact areas to detect note presses."</em> <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/182793-guitar-pickguard-wireless-midi-controller">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In this tutorial, we’ll have a look at how we can create an MQTT sensor for Home Assistant with ESP32 and the Toit platform. Home Assistant is one of the largest open-source platforms for home automation and is very popular for managing things through IoT. Toit on the other hand provides an excellent platform for building and deploying IoT applications with very little effort. Toit recently released the support for MQTT protocol and we’ll be using it to send temperature and humidity values coming from an SHT31-D sensor. The data will then be displayed in Home Assistant in interactive cards with the graphical format. Finally, we’ll also send a high-temperature notification alert through the Home Assistant’s mobile phone app."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/harshkc2000/esp32-and-toit-integrating-home-assistant-through-mqtt-d090a2">[...]</a>
