<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1706, o fabricante inglês de instrumentos ópticos e astronómicos <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dollond">John Dollond</a>. Ele desenvolveu (1758) e patenteou um telescópio refractor acromático (sem distorção de cor) e um heliometro prático, um telescópio usado para medir o diâmetro do Sol e os ângulos entre os corpos celestes. Na década de 1730, Chester More Hall, um advogado com interesse em telescópios, descobriu pela primeira vez que o vidro de sílex parecia ter uma dispersão de cor maior do que o vidro da coroa com as mesmas ampliações. Hall concluiu que se ele cimentasse a face côncava de uma lente de sílex à face convexa de uma lente de vidro coroa, ele podia remover as propriedades de dispersão (e, portanto, a aberração cromática) de ambas as lentes simultaneamente. Dollond aprendeu a técnica na década de 1750 e desenvolveu-a.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1710, o óptico e astrónomo britânico <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Short_(mathematician)">James Short</a>. Ele produziu os primeiros espelhos verdadeiramente parabólicos e elípticos (portanto, quase sem distorção) para telescópios reflectores. Durante a sua vida profissional de mais de 35 anos, Short fez cerca de 1.360 instrumentos - não apenas para clientes na Grã-Bretanha, mas também para exportação: um ainda está preservado em Leninegrado, outro em Uppsala e vários na América. Short foi o principal calculador das observações do Trânsito de Vénus feitas em todo o mundo em 6 de Junho de 1761. Os seus instrumentos viajaram no Endeavour com o Capitão Cook para observar o próximo Trânsito de Vénus em 3 de Junho de 1769, mas Short morreu antes que esse evento acontecesse.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1803, o engenheiro hidráulico francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Darcy">Henry Darcy</a>. Ele foi o primeiro que derivou a equação (agora conhecida como lei de Darcy) que governa o fluxo laminar (não turbulento) de fluidos em meios homogéneos e porosos. Em 1856, os estudos modernos das águas subterrâneas começaram quando Darcy foi contratado para desenvolver um sistema de purificação de água para a cidade de Dijon, França. Ele construiu o primeiro aparato experimental para estudar as características do fluxo da água através da terra. A partir das suas experiências, ele derivou a equação da Lei de Darcy, que descreve o fluxo da água na natureza, que é fundamental para a compreensão dos sistemas de água subterrânea. Ele realizou testes extensivos de filtragem e resistência do tubo.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1832, o engenheiro e inventor alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Otto">Nicolaus Otto</a>. Ele desenvolveu o motor de combustão interna de quatro tempos, que ofereceu a primeira alternativa prática ao motor a vapor como fonte de energia. Um engenheiro francês, Alphonse Beau de Rochas, formulou o projecto básico para o motor de combustão interna de quatro tempos e patenteou-o em 1862, mas nunca construiu um modelo funcional. Em 1876, Otto usou princípios de Beau de Rochas e outros para construir o protótipo dos motores de automóveis de hoje, muitas vezes chamados de motor de ciclo Otto. Ele vendeu milhares de cópias antes que Beau de Rochas o processasse e invalidasse a patente de Otto. Mas motores leves e eficientes do ciclo Otto possibilitaram em grande parte a criação de automóveis, barcos a motor, motocicletas e até aviões.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1927, o físico americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Parker">Eugene Parker</a>. Ele fez extensas pesquisas sobre o vento solar e os efeitos dos campos magnéticos na heliosfera. Além de aumentar a compreensão da coroa solar, seu trabalho investigou as complexas interacções electromagnéticas tanto no sol quanto em sua interacção com o campo magnético terrestre. Ele viveu para ver modelos teóricos (que ele desenvolveu antes da era espacial) serem confirmados por sondas espaciais na heliosfera. As suas ideias originais foram formadas a partir das informações limitadas disponíveis a partir de observações das caudas dos cometas à medida que eram modificados a viajar perto do sol. Ele cunhou o nome de “vento solar” na década de 1950, para a cascata de energia quando propôs como nosso sol (e outras estrelas) emitem energia.</p>

<p>A 1752, Benjamin Franklin usa um papagaio durante uma tempestade e carrega a carga eléctrica ambiente numa jarra de Leyden, permitindo-lhe demonstrar a conexão entre relâmpagos e electricidade. Franklin interessou-se por electricidade em meados da década de 1740, uma época em que ainda se desconhecia muito sobre o assunto, e passou quase uma década a realizar experiências com electricidade. Ele cunhou vários termos usados hoje, incluindo bateria, condutor e electricista. Ele também inventou o pára-raios, usado para proteger edifícios e navios.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou o helicóptero Ingenuity completa o seu sétimo voo na superfície de Marte. O helicóptero de 1,8 quilos voltou aos céus marcianos na terça-feira (8 de Junho), fazendo a sua primeira saída desde que lutou contra uma anomalia em voo, a 22 de Maio. E não houve problemas desta vez.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker assim como alguns videos interessantes. É apresentado o livro "The Computers That Made Britain"</p>

<p><em>"NASA has selected two new missions to Venus, Earth’s nearest planetary neighbor. Part of NASA’s Discovery Program, the missions aim to understand how Venus became an inferno-like world when it has so many other characteristics similar to ours – and may have been the first habitable world in the solar system, complete with an ocean and Earth-like climate. These investigations are the final selections from four mission concepts NASA picked in February 2020 as part of the agency’s Discovery 2019 competition. Following a competitive, peer-review process, the two missions were chosen based on their potential scientific value and the feasibility of their development plans. The project teams will now work to finalize their requirements, designs, and development plans. NASA is awarding approximately $500 million per mission for development."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-2-missions-to-study-lost-habitable-world-of-venus">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Today, we’re announcing Firmina, an open subsea cable being built by Google that will run from the East Coast of the United States to Las Toninas, Argentina, with additional landings in Praia Grande, Brazil, and Punta del Este, Uruguay. Firmina will be the longest cable in the world capable of running entirely from a single power source at one end of the cable if its other power source(s) become temporarily unavailable—a resilience boost at a time when reliable connectivity is more important than ever. As people and businesses have come to depend on digital services for many aspects of their lives, Firmina will improve access to Google services for users in South America. With 12 fiber pairs, the cable will carry traffic quickly and securely between North and South America, giving users fast, low-latency access to Google products such as Search, Gmail and YouTube, as well as Google Cloud services. Single-end power source capability is important for reliability, a key priority for Google’s network. With submarine cables, data travels as pulses of light inside the cable’s optical fibers."</em> <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure/announcing-the-firmina-subsea-cable">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.page-roberts.com/2021/05/feature-advancements/">Page-Roberts reveals EV design concept capable of 30% longer range</a></h2>

<p><em>"Page-Roberts has revealed a patented design concept for an electric vehicle with world beating efficiency, releasing the potential for 30% greater range for an equivalent battery size. Until now, EV manufacturers have been drawn towards placing the batteries under the floor as a convenient way to package sufficient battery energy for an acceptable range. The drawbacks of this are the added height, added weight, body structural complexities, along with an often-extended wheelbase. The Page-Roberts innovation positions the battery between the front row seats and a second row of rear-facing seats. This arrangement is far more compact than standard electric vehicle designs on the market and offers the exciting potential for a lower, more aerodynamic vehicle with a standard wheelbase. The resulting vehicle will be lighter, more streamlined and up to 30% more efficient."</em> <a href="https://www.page-roberts.com/2021/05/feature-advancements/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.onsemi.com/PowerSolutions/newsItem.do?article=1000912">ON Semiconductor Announces New Full Silicon Carbide MOSFET Module Solutions for Charging Electric Vehicles at APEC 2021</a></h2>

<p><em>"ON Semiconductor® (Nasdaq:ON), driving energy efficient innovations, has announced a pair of 1200 V full silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFET 2-PACK modules further enhancing their range of products suitable for the challenging electric vehicle (EV) market. As sales of EV continue to grow, infrastructure must be rolled-out to meet the needs of drivers, providing a network of rapid charging stations that will allow them to complete their journeys quickly and without ‘range anxiety’. Requirements in this sector are rapidly evolving, requiring power levels in excess of 350 kW and efficiencies of 95% becoming the ‘norm’. Given the diverse environments and locations in which these chargers are deployed, compactness, robustness and enhanced reliability are all challenges that designers face. The new 1200 V M1 full SiC MOSFET 2 pack modules, based upon planar technology and suited to a drive voltage in the range of 18-20 V, are simple to drive with negative gate voltages.

<p><em>"Engineers can design high-speed digital control loops with the highest dynamic range and lowest latency while reducing power consumption by as much as 65% Texas Instruments (TI) (Nasdaq: TXN) today expanded its portfolio of high-speed data converters with a broad new family of successive-approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) that enable high-precision data acquisition in industrial designs. Featuring best-in-class dynamic range at the lowest power consumption, the ADC3660 family includes eight SAR ADCs in 14-, 16- and 18-bit resolution at sampling speeds ranging from 10 to 125 MSPS, helping designers improve signal resolution, extend battery life and strengthen system protection. For more information, explore the ADC3660 family at www.ti.com/ADC3660family-pr. Increasing the precision of high-speed data acquisition addresses a rising need for real-time control in industrial systems. In a high-speed digital control loop, the ADC acts in a complex system to respond to fast changes in voltage or current to help prevent costly damage to critical components in power-management systems. As the number of data-intensive tasks in industrial systems increases, it becomes more important for the system to make quick decisions to prevent system failure, requiring higher precision at faster speeds."</em> <a href="https://news.ti.com/ti-bridges-high-speed-and-precision-gap-with-new-sar-adc-family-including-industrys-fastest-18-bit-adc">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Understanding how magnetic correlations change over very short timescales could be harnessed to control magnetism for applications including data storage and superconductivity What happens when very short pulses of laser light strike a magnetic material? A large international collaboration led by the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Brookhaven National Laboratory set out to answer this very question. As they just reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the laser suppressed magnetic order across the entire material for several picoseconds, or trillionths of a second. Understanding how magnetic correlations change on ultrafast timescales is the first step in being able to control magnetism in application-oriented ways. For example, with such control, we may be able to more quickly write data to memory devices or enhance superconductivity (the phenomenon in which a material conducts electricity without energy loss), which often competes with other states like magnetism. The material studied was strontium iridium oxide (Sr3Ir2O7), an antiferromagnet with a bilayer crystal structure and a large magnetic anisotropy."</em> <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=118870">[...]</a>

The study, published in Nature Communications, was carried out in collaboration with teams at the University of Exeter, India, Switzerland, Singapore, and the US. HDDs first appeared in the 1950s, but their use as storage devices in personal computers only took off from the mid-1980s. They have become ever smaller in size, and denser in terms of the number of stored bytes. While solid state drives are popular for mobile devices, HDDs continue to be used to store files in desktop computers, largely due to their favourable cost to produce and purchase.

<p><em>"Like all metals, silver, copper, and gold are conductors. Electrons flow across them, carrying heat and electricity. While gold is a good conductor under any conditions, some materials have the property of behaving like metal conductors only if temperatures are high enough; at low temperatures, they act like insulators and do not do a good job of carrying electricity. In other words, these unusual materials go from acting like a chunk of gold to acting like a piece of wood as temperatures are lowered. Physicists have developed theories to explain this so-called metal–insulator transition, but the mechanisms behind the transitions are not always clear. "In some cases, it is not easy to predict whether a material is a metal or an insulator," explains Caltech visiting associate Yejun Feng of the Okinawa Institute for Science and Technology Graduate University."</em> <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/magnetism-drives-metals-to-insulators-in-new-experiment">[...]</a>

About 60 percent of drugs on the market have hydrophobic molecules as their active ingredients.

The ability to observe solution-based chemical reactions with sub-nanometre resolution in real time has been highly sought after since the invention of the electron microscope 90 years ago. Imaging the dynamics of a reaction can provide mechanistic insights and signpost strategies for tailoring the properties the resulting materials. A transmission electron microscope (TEM) is one of a few instruments capable of resolving individual atoms, though conventionally it requires completely dry samples imaged in a vacuum environment, precluding any wet chemical synthesis. Based on previous work developing graphene liquid cells that allow TEM imaging of liquid-phase nanostructures, a team of researchers based at The University of Manchester’s National Graphene Institute, collaborating with researchers at the Leibniz University Hannover, have shown that two solutions can be mixed inside the microscope and imaged in real time.

The proof of concept opens the door to a range of compact varifocal lenses for possible use in many imaging applications such as satellites, telescopes and microscopes, which traditionally focus light using curved lenses that adjust using mechanical parts. In some applications, moving traditional glass or plastic lenses to vary the focal distance is simply not practical due to space, weight or size considerations. Metalenses are flat arrays of nano-antennas or resonators, less than a micron thick, that act as focusing devices. But until now, once a metalens was fabricated, its focal length was hard to change, according to Melissa Bosch, doctoral student and first author of a paper detailing the research in the American Chemical Society’s journal Nano Letters.

Overview Having worked in corporate America for the better part of 40 years, I’ve seen corporate computer security policies change over that time from almost none to nearly insane. Today many IT groups force the computers they maintain to require a password to be entered if the computer goes to sleep, which can occur in as few as 5 minutes, in some cases. A recent employer of mine also went to a two step authentication scheme using your password and a token device that displays a set of numbers that also have to be entered as a second password. While this security is nice and sometimes essential, it can be very annoying if you actually need to get something done (besides entering passwords). I can’t count the times I’ve been interrupted at my desk by a conversation with a co worker only to find that when I get back to my computer, the screen has gone to the lock screen and I have to enter the password and a token value to continue."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/Rick-G1/mousemover-5b178e">[...]</a>
