<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1904, o físico russo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Cherenkov">Pavel A. Cherenkov</a>. Ele descobriu a radiação Cherenkov (1934), uma luz azul ténue emitida por electrões a passar por um meio transparente quando a sua velocidade excede a velocidade da luz nesse meio. Os colegas cientistas soviéticos Igor Y. Tamm e Ilya M. Frank investigaram o fenómeno a partir do qual o contador Cherenkov foi desenvolvido. A utilização extensiva deste detector Cherenkov foi feita mais tarde em aplicações de física nuclear experimental e de partículas. Pelo seu trabalho, o trio partilhou o Prémio Nobel da Física de 1958.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1915, o físico nuclear norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Ghiorso">Albert Ghiorso</a>. Ele co-descobriu 12 novos elementos da tabela periódica. No início da década de 1940, Seaborg mudou-se para Chicago para trabalhar no Projecto Manhattan. Convidou Ghiorso a juntar-se a ele, e durante os quatro anos seguintes Ghiorso desenvolveu instrumentos sensíveis para detectar a radiação associada à decadência nuclear, incluindo a fissão espontânea. Um dos instrumentos inovadores de Ghiorso foi um analisador de altura de pulso de 48 canais, o que lhe permitiu identificar a energia, e portanto a fonte, da radiação. Durante este tempo descobriram dois novos elementos (95, americium e 96, curium), embora a publicação tenha sido retida até depois da guerra. Após a guerra, Seaborg e Ghiorso regressaram a Berkeley, onde eles e colegas utilizaram o ciclotrão Crocker de 60" para produzir elementos com o número atómico aumentado bombardeando alvos exóticos com iões de hélio. Em experiências durante 1949-1950, produziram e identificaram elementos 97 (berkelium) e 98 (californium). Em 1953, numa colaboração com o Laboratório Argonne, Ghiorso e colaboradores procuraram e encontraram elementos 99 (einsteinium) e 100 (fermium), identificados pela sua radiação característica na poeira recolhida por aviões desde a primeira explosão termonuclear (o teste Mike). Em 1955, o grupo utilizou o ciclotrão para produzir 17 átomos do elemento 101 (mendelevium), o primeiro elemento novo a ser descoberto átomo-por-atomo. A técnica de recuo inventada por Ghiorso foi crucial para a obtenção de um sinal identificável de átomos individuais do novo elemento. Em meados dos anos 50, tornou-se claro que para prolongar ainda mais a tabela periódica, seria necessário um novo acelerador, e foi construído o Berkeley Heavy Ion Linear Accelerator (HILAC), com Ghiorso no comando. Esta máquina foi utilizada na descoberta dos elementos 102-106 (102, nobelium; 103, lawrencium; 104, rutherfordium; 105, dubnium e 106, seaborgium), cada um produzido e identificado com base em apenas alguns átomos. A descoberta de cada elemento sucessivo foi possível graças ao desenvolvimento de técnicas inovadoras de manipulação robótica de alvos, química rápida, detectores de radiação eficientes, e processamento informático de dados. A actualização de 1972 do HILAC para o superHILAC forneceu feixes de iões de maior intensidade, o que foi crucial para produzir átomos novos suficientes para permitir a detecção do elemento 106.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1918, o físico canadiano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertram_Brockhouse">Bertram Brockhouse</a>. Ele desenvolveu técnicas de difracção de neutrões utilizadas para o estudo da estrutura e propriedades da matéria para a qual partilhou o Prémio Nobel da Física em 1994 (com o físico americano Clifford G. Shull). Ao conceber instrumentos para medir a energia dos neutrões dispersos a partir de um material sólido, Brockhouse forneceu uma visão da sua estrutura atómica. Tornou possíveis avanços na tecnologia dos semicondutores. O seu Espectrómetro de Neutrões de Triplo Eixo é agora amplamente utilizado não só para investigar estruturas atómicas, mas também moléculas de vírus e ADN.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1921, o bioquímico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bruce_Merrifield">Robert Bruce Merrifield</a>. Ele recebeu o Prémio Nobel da Química de 1984 pelo seu desenvolvimento do método de síntese de peptídeos de fase sólida para a construção de grandes moléculas orgânicas sobre uma matriz sólida. Primeiro anexou um aminoácido a pequenas esferas de polímero plástico, depois adicionou outros aminoácidos, um após o outro, até se construir uma cadeia de polipeptídeos. A cadeia foi então libertada do polímero. As cadeias de aminoácidos podem assim ser construídas em qualquer ordem pré-determinada para sintetizar uma grande variedade de proteínas, hormonas, e outras moléculas orgânicas. O trabalho de Merrifield abrangeu o desenvolvimento de resinas, a protecção de grupos e estratégias químicas, e a engenharia que trouxe a automatização à química peptídea.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1922, o físico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_M._Lederman">Leon M. Lederman</a>. Ele partilhou (com Melvin Schwartz e Jack Steinberger) o Prémio Nobel da Física de 1988 pela sua investigação conjunta e descoberta (1960-62) de uma nova partícula subatómica, o neutrino muon. Neutrinos são partículas subatómicas sem massa detectável e sem carga eléctrica, que se deslocam à velocidade da luz. A descoberta do neutrino muon, foi seguida de descobertas por outros cientistas de uma série de diferentes "famílias" de partículas subatómicas. Juntas, formam agora um modelo padrão, um esquema que tem sido utilizado para classificar todas as partículas elementares conhecidas.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1930 o matemático americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Smale">Stephen Smale</a>. Ele recebeu a Medalha Fields em 1966 pelo seu trabalho em topologia e sistemas dinâmicos. Um dos seus estudos (1961) foi sobre a conjectura generalizada de Poincaré, um famoso problema do século XX, que afirma que um colector tridimensional fechado simplesmente ligado é uma esfera tridimensional. Smale provou uma conjectura de Poincaré de dimensão superior para um colector n-dimensional onde n é pelo menos 5. Noutro trabalho, relacionado com estranhos atractores, um dos primeiros fractais a ser estudado conhecido, descobriu estranhos atractores que levam a sistemas dinâmicos caóticos. (Um atractor na mecânica clássica é uma forma geométrica de descrever o comportamento de um sistema dinâmico). O seu trabalho recente tem sido sobre a informática teórica.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1943, a astrónomo britânica <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jocelyn_Bell_Burnell">Jocelyn Bell Burnell</a>. Ela descobriu os primeiros quatro pulsares. Era uma estudante graduada da Universidade de Cambridge, com 24 anos, à procura de quasares em 1967, quando reparou num sinal de rádio estelar invulgar - uma série rápida de pulsos que se repete a cada 1.337 segundos. Este farol interestelar não foi feito pelo homem, por isso foi apelidado de diversão como LGM, para "Little Green Man". Nos meses seguintes, Bell encontrou mais três fontes de impulsos de rádio através de uma análise cuidadosa de centenas páginas anotadas a caneta. Estas representavam uma nova classe de objectos celestes - pulsares - que os astrónomos acabaram por associar à matéria superdensa na fase final da evolução das estrelas maciças. Até à data, foram identificados mais algumas centenas de pulsares.</p>

<p>Em 1954, o Boeing 707 fazia o seu primeiro voo. Na altura conhecido como Boeing 376-80 o avião a jacto tornar-se-ia um dos mais populares de todos os tempos. Hoje em dia versões modificadas deste avião ainda voam como o KC-135 tanker e o E-3 AWACS.</p>

<p>Em 1965, depois de ter chegado a Marte no dia anterior, a sonda Mariner 4 envia para a Terra as primeiras 22 fotografias de Marte. Todas elas apresentam Marte como um vasto e estéril deserto de crateras e areia cor de ferrugem, afastando as suspeitas do século XIX de que uma civilização avançada poderia existir no planeta.</p>

<p>Faz hoje quinze anos que uma empresa chamada Odeo lançava oficialmente uma aplicação chamada Twttr. Nem o nome da empresa nem o nome da aplicação ficaram para a história. Hoje em dia a empresa tem o nome actualmente conhecido da aplicação e chama-se Twitter. Esta era apenas um "side-project" da empresa.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou a Virgin Galactic anunciou que a Unidade VSS alcançou com sucesso o espaço, completando o quarto voo espacial da Companhia movido a foguetes. O voo foi o 22º voo de teste do VSS Unity e o primeiro voo de teste com uma tripulação completa na cabine, incluindo o fundador da Companhia, Sir Richard Branson. A tripulação cumpriu uma série de objectivos de teste relacionados com a experiência da cabine e do cliente, incluindo a avaliação da cabine do cliente comercial, as vistas da Terra a partir do espaço, as condições para a realização de investigação e a eficácia do programa de treino de cinco dias de pré-voo no Spaceport America. A Unidade VSS atingiu uma velocidade de Mach 3 após ter sido libertada da nave mãe, VMS Eve. O veículo alcançou o espaço, a uma altitude de cerca de 86 quilómetros, antes de deslizar suavemente para uma pista de aterragem no Spaceport America.</p>

<p><em>"Known as ultraluminous X-ray sources, the emitters are easy to spot when viewed straight on, but they might be hidden from view if they point even slightly away from Earth. It’s hard to miss a flashlight beam pointed straight at you. But that beam viewed from the side appears significantly dimmer. The same holds true for some cosmic objects: Like a flashlight, they radiate primarily in one direction, and they look dramatically different depending on whether the beam points away from Earth (and nearby space telescopes) or straight at it. New data from NASA’s NuSTAR space observatory indicates that this phenomenon holds true for some of the most prominent X-ray emitters in the local universe: ultraluminous X-ray sources, or ULXs. Most cosmic objects, including stars, radiate little X-ray light, particularly in the high-energy range seen by NuSTAR."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/seeing-some-cosmic-x-ray-emitters-might-be-a-matter-of-perspective">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Samsung Electronics, a world leader in advanced semiconductor technology, today introduced ISOCELL Auto 4AC, an automotive image sensor that offers advanced 120-decibel (dB) high dynamic range (HDR) and LED flicker mitigation (LFM) especially for surround-view monitors (SVM) or rear-view cameras (RVC) in high-definition resolution (1280 x 960). The new sensor is Samsung’s first imaging solution optimized for automotive applications. “The new ISOCELL Auto 4AC combines Samsung’s innovative and market-proven image sensor technologies with a unique CornerPixel™ solution for advanced HDR and LFM capabilities, offering exceptional viewing experiences regardless of lighting conditions,” said Duckhyun Chang, executive vice president of sensor business at Samsung Electronics. “Starting with the ISOCELL Auto 4AC, we plan to expand our automotive sensor lineup to areas such as camera monitor systems (CMS), autonomous driving and in-cabin monitoring.” Various lighting situations on the road may pose obstacles to the driver. Quick transitions from a low-lit environment to a brighter one, such as exiting a tunnel, may require a few seconds for the driver’s eyes to adjust. Also, flickering from LED headlamps or road signage, such as street lamps and traffic lights, could become increasingly noticeable on the automotive system’s camera screen."</em> <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-introduces-its-first-isocell-image-sensor-tailored-for-automotive-applications">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.renesas.com/eu/en/about/press-room/new-renesas-solution-automotive-cameras-enables-high-definition-video-using-low-cost-cables-and">New Renesas Solution For Automotive Cameras Enables High-Definition Video Using Low-Cost Cables and Connectors</a></h2>

<p><em>"Automotive HD Link (AHL) Complements Other Renesas Products in Auto Safety Systems; Includes Unique Control Channel That Initializes, Programs and Monitors the Camera Function Renesas Electronics Corporation (TSE:6723), a premier supplier of advanced semiconductor solutions, today introduced its new Automotive HD Link (AHL) technology that enables automotive manufacturers to deliver high-definition video over low-cost cables and connectors that currently support standard-definition video. HD video is increasingly important in car safety systems for object recognition functionality. Renesas is a leader in the Advanced Driver Assist Systems (ADAS) market, and AHL can be paired with other Renesas products, such as the R-Car Automotive SoCs, RH850 MCUs, automotive PMICs, and analog components to cost-effectively implement numerous safety features in virtually any vehicle. The new RAA279971 AHL encoder and RAA279972 decoder use a modulated analog signal to transmit the video, enabling transmission rates 10 times less than required to transmit HD signals digitally.

<p><em>"New Lineup Provides High Reliability and Reduced SWAP; Co-Packaged Solution for Space Delivers World-Class GaN FET Driver Performance Renesas Electronics Corporation (TSE:6723), a premier supplier of advanced semiconductor solutions, today launched a new line of plastic-packaged radiation-hardened (rad-hard) devices for satellite power management systems. The four new devices include the ISL71001SLHM/SEHM point of load (POL) buck regulator, ISL71610SLHM and ISL71710SLHM digital isolators, and the ISL73033SLHM 100V GaN FET and integrated low-side driver. Combining rad-hard assurance levels with the board area savings and cost advantages of plastic packaging, the new portfolio brings space-grade solutions to missions in medium/geosynchronous Earth orbit (MEO/GEO) with longer lifetime requirements, as well as small satellites (smallsats) and higher density electronics, while reducing size, weight, and power (SWaP) costs. The new ICs also complement the radiation-tolerant plastic-package ICs Renesas introduced in 2017 for smallsats in Low Earth Orbit. Together, Renesas’ plastic IC lineup supports multiple orbit ranges, providing the radiation performance and optimal cost balance required for a variety of satellite subsystems and payloads. “With every new mission, customers want more functionality, which requires larger satellite payloads and has traditionally translated into increased SWaP for the satellite systems,” said Philip Chesley, Vice President, Industrial and Communications Business Division at Renesas."</em> <a href="https://www.renesas.com/eu/en/about/press-room/renesas-launches-high-reliability-radiation-hardened-plastic-portfolio-satellites-medium-and">[...]</a>

<p><em>"​Imagine sitting out in the sun, reading a digital screen as thin as paper, but seeing the same image quality as if you were indoors. Thanks to research from Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, it could soon be a reality. A new type of reflective screen – sometimes described as ‘electronic paper’ – offers optimal colour display, while using ambient light to keep energy consumption to a minimum.​​ Traditional digital screens use a backlight to illuminate the text or images displayed upon them. This is fine indoors, but we’ve all experienced the difficulties of viewing such screens in bright sunshine. Reflective screens, however, attempt to use the ambient light, mimicking the way our eyes respond to natural paper. “For reflective screens to compete with the energy-intensive digital screens that we use today, images and colours must be reproduced with the same high quality."</em> <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/chem/news/Pages/New-electronic-paper-displays-brilliant-colours-.aspx">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Wikipedia says : A joule thief is a minimalist self-oscillating voltage booster that is small, low-cost, and easy to build, typically used for driving small loads. This circuit is also known by other names such as blocking oscillator, joule ringer, vampire torch. It can use nearly all of the energy in a single-cell electric battery, even far below the voltage where other circuits consider the battery fully discharged (or "dead"); hence the name, which suggests the notion that the circuit is stealing energy or "joules" from the source the term is a pun on "jewel thief". The circuit is a variant of the blocking oscillator that forms an unregulated voltage boost converter. The output voltage is increased at the expense of higher current draw on the input, but the integrated (average) current of the output is lowered and brightness of a luminescence decreased. I say it's a fun little weekend project that can be done with very few parts (even salvaged) and discharged/dead batteries."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Simple-Joule-Thief-2/">[...]</a>

You have a big power (Watt) when you have a high flow which push hard ;-) As first thing I tested my device, and I started to imagine the best way to build something around it. As you can see I connected it to the battery pack I lately refurbished with ten 18650 cells. Since that Li-Ion power bank is quite powerful now, I wished to take the best advantage from it.

The first thing to do is to choose your object detection algorithm between Faster RCNN, SSD, FPN, YOLO and more."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/shahizat005/face-mask-detection-system-using-ai-and-nvidia-jetson-board-3cfae7">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Make a Forehead thermometer at home! Homemade forehead temperature gun It took a long time to make a work, a forehead gun! The only work that was useful during the epidemic! Recap Since February 2020, the new crown pneumonia epidemic has been out of control, making everyone very scared. In April 2020, when I was studying programs at school, my teacher told me that I found a web page to teach you how to make a cheap forehead gun, so I clicked it in and took a look. The next day, the teacher took out three parts: 1.Arduino Pro Micro 2.mlx90614 3.SSD1306 oled Then tell me that I bought the parts to make the forehead gun, and I can show you the research."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/n20100117/forehead-thermometer-1efa2f">[...]</a>

<p><em>"An air monitor that can measure CO, CO2, H2, CH4, NH3, Alcohol, Bangene, Acetone, Hexane, Toluene, Smoke and Flammable gas concentration. For a long time, I wanted to monitor every component in the air only using low-cost MQ sensors. So I ordered a set of 9 MQ sensors and made this project, in which I can measure the concentration of many kinds of gas in the air only using some MQ sensors. This kind of sensor is not so accurate and needs lots of calibration, but they are the best cheap gas sensors out there. You can find a set of nine gas sensors for only $6 to $7. in my project, I use 6 of them and measure the gas concentration of 12 gases."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/abid_hossain/air-analyzer-using-almost-all-kinds-of-mq-sensors-01c2a4">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Understanding the attire for your morning run based on differences in indoor &amp; outdoor heat indexes built on Particle and local weather data The quest to wear the right clothing based on the difference between indoor and outdoor heat indexes when making my morning run is made easier using this Activewear Suggestion station. That is built using a Particle Boron with a grove shield and Open Weather Map “Current Weather Data” API. I attached a DHT 11 sensor to collect indoor temperature/relative humidity and an OLED screen to display indoor and outdoor temperature/relative humidity collected from Open Weather Map. Finally, an RGB LED that changes color based on the difference between the indoor and outdoor heat indexes calculated using our Indoor heat index and outdoor heat index functions. For this project I will be using Particle Workbench that provides all the tools, libraries and extensions you need for IoT development in a single, easy-to-install package. Additionally, by clicking on this link you’ll be taken to the Particle Web IDE that is an Integrated Development Environment; which just so happens to run in your web browser."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/talal-gedeon/activewear-suggestion-station-897b41">[...]</a>

<p><em>"An analogue proximity circuit built with active and passive components Hey there, thanks for coming around, I would love to walk you through on how to create a fully functional proximity sensor and understanding the logic behind it…They are various way to go about it, like using microcontrollers, but I decided to go analogue by building with a few active and passive component. So let’s get to it... In simple terms, A proximity sensor helps you detect a difference in distance from a point or more. The function of the build will be such that the system can both indicate when an obstacle is within proximity and also when it’s out of proximity, and to achieve that we need to get an understanding of some of the components we’re going to work with... 1. LM358 Operational Amplifier 2. Infrared Emitter 3."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/peterclement/proximity-sensor-d1b884">[...]</a>
