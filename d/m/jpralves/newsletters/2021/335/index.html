<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1802, o químico francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_J%C3%A9r%C3%B4me_Balard">Antoine Jérôme Balard</a>. Ele descobriu o elemento bromo, determinou as suas propriedades, e estudou alguns dos seus compostos. Mais tarde, provou a presença de bromo em plantas e animais marinhos. Esta descoberta foi um subproduto de uma investigação química mais geral sobre o mar e as suas formas de vida. O bromo tinha um peso atómico próximo da média aritmética de dois outros halogéneos conhecidos, o cloro e o iodo, sugerindo que formavam uma "família química". Também investigou a extracção barata de sais da água do mar. Descobriu o ácido oxâmico, utilizando o calor para decompor o oxilato de hidrogénio de amónio. Estudou e nomeou o álcool amílico.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1870, o físico francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Baptiste_Perrin">Jean Baptiste Perrin</a>. Ele, nos seus estudos sobre o movimento browniano de partículas minúsculas suspensas em líquidos, verificou a explicação de Albert Einstein sobre este fenómeno e confirmou assim a natureza atómica da matéria. Utilizando uma emulsão gamboge, Perrin foi capaz de determinar por um novo método, uma das constantes físicas mais importantes, o número de Avogadro (o número de moléculas de uma substância em tantas gramas como indicado pelo peso molecular, por exemplo, o número de moléculas em duas gramas de hidrogénio). O valor obtido correspondia, dentro dos limites de erro, ao dado pela teoria cinética dos gases. Por esta conquista foi galardoado com o Prémio Nobel da Física em 1926.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1882, o físico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Geiger">Hans Geiger</a>. Ele introduziu o contador Geiger, o primeiro detector de partículas alfa individuais e outras radiações ionizantes bem sucedidas. Após ter obtido o seu doutoramento na Universidade de Erlangen em 1906, colaborou na Universidade de Manchester com Ernest Rutherford. Utilizou a primeira versão do seu contador de partículas, e outros detectores, em experiências que levaram à identificação da partícula alfa como núcleo do átomo de hélio e à declaração de Rutherford (1912) de que o núcleo ocupa um volume muito pequeno no átomo. O contador Geiger-Müller (desenvolvido com Walther Müller) tinha melhorado a durabilidade, desempenho e sensibilidade para detectar não só partículas alfa mas também partículas beta (electrões) e fótons electromagnéticos ionizantes. Geiger regressou à Alemanha em 1912 e continuou a investigar os raios cósmicos, a radioactividade artificial, e a fissão nuclear.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1905, o físico inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevill_Francis_Mott">Nevill Francis Mott</a>. Ele partilhou (com PhilipW. Anderson e John H. Van Vleck dos EUA) o Prémio Nobel da Física de 1977 pelas suas pesquisas independentes sobre as propriedades magnéticas e eléctricas dos semicondutores amorfos. Enquanto as propriedades eléctricas dos cristais são descritas pela Teoria da Banda - que compara a condutividade dos metais, semicondutores, e isoladores - uma famosa excepção é fornecida pelo óxido de níquel. Segundo a teoria da banda, o óxido de níquel deveria ser um condutor metálico mas na realidade é um isolante. Mott refinou a teoria para incluir a interacção electrão-electrão e explicou as chamadas transições Mott, através das quais alguns metais se tornam isoladores à medida que a densidade de electrões diminui, separando os átomos uns dos outros de alguma forma conveniente.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1917, o inventor norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_B._Kahn">Irving B. Kahn</a>. Ele inventou o teleprompter. Em meados dos anos 50, Kahn concebeu e construiu o que foi talvez o primeiro sistema de projecção traseira controlada remotamente e com várias imagens no mundo para as instalações do exército dos EUA em Huntsville, Ala., para fazer apresentações persuasivas aos congressistas visitantes. Com cinco imagens (uma grande, 3¼ por 4 diapositivos ou imagem de filme no centro, flanqueada por diapositivos menores em cada lado) e acesso aleatório, poderia pesquisar e seleccionar entre 500 diapositivos. TelePrompTer também fez muitas contribuições tecnológicas para a primitiva indústria da televisão por cabo. Em 1961, Kahn e Hub Schlafley demonstraram a Key TV, um conceito precoce de TV paga, ao mostrar o segundo combate de pesos pesados Patterson vs. Johansson, dando essencialmente origem a pay-per-view.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1939, o químico francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Marie_Lehn">Jean-Marie Lehn</a>. Ele partilhou (com Charles J. Pedersen e Donald J. Cram) o Prémio Nobel da Química de 1987, pela sua contribuição para a síntese laboratorial de moléculas que imitam as funções químicas vitais das moléculas nos organismos vivos. Tais moléculas têm uma interacção altamente selectiva e específica da estrutura. Estas moléculas podem "reconhecer-se" umas às outras e escolher com que outras moléculas irão formar complexos. De baixo peso molecular e com propriedades muito especiais, as moléculas destes compostos ligam-se de forma selectiva, como uma chave encaixa numa fechadura.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1943, o bioquímico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Deisenhofer">Johann Deisenhofer</a>. Ele recebeu o Prémio Nobel da Química de 1988, juntamente com Hartmut Michel e Robert Huber, pela determinação da estrutura tridimensional de certas proteínas essenciais à fotossíntese. Utilizando a cristalografia de raios X (1982-85), desvendaram todos os detalhes de como uma proteína ligada à membrana é construída, revelando a estrutura do átomo da molécula por átomo. A proteína foi retirada de uma bactéria que, como as plantas verdes e as algas, utiliza a energia da luz solar para construir substâncias orgânicas. A fotossíntese em bactérias é mais simples do que em algas e plantas superiores, mas o trabalho levou a uma maior compreensão da fotossíntese também nesses organismos.</p>

<p>Em 1982, H. Ross Perot e Jay Colburn completaram a primeira circum-navegação do mundo num helicóptero, o Espírito do Texas. A sua viagem começou 29 dias, 3 horas, e 8 minutos antes, a 1 de Setembro. Para a sua viagem à volta do mundo, que começou e terminou em Fort Worth, Texas, Perot e Coburn pilotaram um Long Ranger com equipamento de navegação completo, equipamento de sobrevivência, e artigos de emergência. Foram adicionados flutuadores pop-out, e um tanque de combustível auxiliar de 151 galões no lugar do assento traseiro foi utilizado para permitir ao Spirit of Texas voar oito horas sem reabastecimento. Um motor de turbina Allison 250-C28B funcionou sem falhas durante 246,5 horas de voo, voando mais de 10 horas por dia, sobre o mar aberto, deserto estéril, e floresta tropical com uma velocidade média no solo de 117 mph.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que o helicóptero Ingenuity, que se encontra na superfície de Marte, realizou um teste de rotação a alta velocidade a 2.800 RPM no solo e que se tudo corresse bem, o passo seguinte seria realizar um voo de curta duração, pairando brevemente sobre a localização actual, com uma velocidade de rotor de 2.700 RPM. No entanto, acabou por ser um voo sem incidentes, porque o Ingenuity decidiu não levantar voo. O equipamento detectou uma anomalia em dois dos pequenos servomotores de controlo de voo (ou simplesmente "servos") durante o seu checkout automático de pré-voo e fez exactamente o que era suposto fazer: Cancelou o voo.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker assim como alguns videos interessantes. São apresentadas as revistas MagPI Nº110 e a HackSpaceMag Nº47 de Outubro.</p>

<p><em>"It’s been an eventful several Martian days, or sols, since our last blog post, so we wanted to provide everyone with an update on where things stand on Mars. In our last post, we explained that we were getting ready to begin flying with a higher rotor speed to compensate for decreasing atmospheric density caused by seasonal changes on Mars. Increasing the rotor speed is a significant change to how we’ve been flying thus far, so we wanted to proceed forward carefully. Step one was to perform a high-speed spin test at 2,800 rpm on the ground and, if everything went well, step two was to perform a short-duration flight, briefly hovering over our current location, with a 2,700 rpm rotor speed. The high-speed spin test was completed successfully on Sept. 15, 2021 at 23:29 PDT, 11:11 LMST local Mars time (Sol 204 of the Perseverance mission). Ingenuity’s motors spun the rotors up to 2,800 rpm, briefly held that speed, and then spun the rotors back down to a stop, all exactly as sequenced for the test."</em> <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/status/336/2800-rpm-spin-a-success-but-flight-14-delayed-to-post-conjunction/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Engineers can meet the need for smaller, lighter systems by cutting power solution size in half with new easy-to-use, bias-supply module Texas Instruments (TI) (Nasdaq: TXN) today introduced the industry’s smallest and most accurate 1.5-W isolated DC/DC bias-supply module. The UCC14240-Q1 uses a proprietary integrated transformer technology to enable designers to cut their power solution size in half for use in high-voltage environments such as electric vehicles (EVs), hybrid EVs, motor-drive systems and grid-tied inverters. For more information, see ti.com/UCC14240-Q1-pr. With the accelerating growth of the EV market, automotive design engineers are looking for ways to improve efficiency and reliability, while also reducing the weight of the heaviest part of the EV: the powertrain. To help meet the need for smaller, more reliable systems to extend driving range, engineers are moving to a distributed power architecture, a scheme where every isolated gate driver has a dedicated bias supply. This architecture improves how the system reacts to single-point failures."</em> <a href="https://news.ti.com/tis-integrated-transformer-module-technology-helps-maximize-drive-time-in-hybrid-and-electric-vehicles">[...]</a>

Engineers and materials scientists studying superconducting quantum information bits (qubits)—a leading quantum computing material platform based on the frictionless flow of paired electrons—have collected clues hinting at the microscopic sources of qubit information loss. This loss is one of the major obstacles in realizing quantum computers capable of stringing together millions of qubits to run demanding computations.

Scientists have previously created superfluids in liquids, solids, and gases, and hope harnessing superfluids’ properties could help lead to discoveries such as a superconductor that works at room temperature. Bhattacharya said such a discovery could revolutionize the electronics industry, where loss of energy due to resistive heating of wires incurs major costs. However, one of the main problems with studying superfluids is that all available methods of measuring the delicate superfluid rotation bring the motion to a halt. Bhattacharya and his team of RIT postdoctoral researchers teamed up with scientists in Japan, Taiwan, and India to propose a new detection method that is minimally destructive, in situ, and in real-time."</em> <a href="https://www.rit.edu/news/researchers-develop-new-method-detecting-superfluid-motion">[...]</a>

The findings are presented in a new joint research paper published online by the prestigious journal Science on Friday, September 24. Cell phones, car sensors or data transmission in fiber optic networks are all using so called Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) – semiconductor lasers that are firmly anchored in our everyday technology. Though widely used, the VCSEL device has miniscule size of only a few microns, which sets a stringent limit on the output power it can generate. For years, scientists have sought to enhance the power emitted by such devices through combining many tiny VCSELs and forcing them to act as a single coherent laser, but had limited success. The current breakthrough uses a different scheme: it employs a unique geometrical arrangement of VCSELs on the chip that forces the flight to flow in a specific path – a photonic topological insulator platform."</em> <a href="https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/en/news-and-events/news/detail/news/erster-topologischer-laser-aus-vertikalen-resonatoren/">[...]</a>

By studying maple trees and other types of wind-dispersed seeds, the engineers optimized the microflier’s aerodynamics to ensure that it — when dropped at a high elevation — falls at a slow velocity in a controlled manner. This behavior stabilizes its flight, ensures dispersal over a broad area and increases the amount of time it interacts with the air, making it ideal for monitoring air pollution and airborne disease.

<p><em>"Rochester researchers next will aim for a combination of spatial, temporal imaging When we look at an object with our eyes, or with a camera, we can automatically gather enough pixels of light at visible wavelengths to have a clear image of what we see. However, to visualize a quantum object or phenomenon where the illumination is weak, or emanating from nonvisible infrared or far infrared wavelengths, scientists need far more sensitive tools. For example, they have developed single-pixel imaging in the spatial domain as a way to pack and spatially structure as many photons as possible onto a single pixel detector and then create an image using computational algorithms. Similarly, in the time domain, when an unknown ultrafast signal is either weak, or in the infrared or far infrared wavelengths, the ability of single-pixel imaging to visualize it is reduced. Based on the spatio-temporal duality of light pulses, University of Rochester researchers have developed a time-domain single-pixel imaging technique, described in Optica, that solves this problem, detecting 5 femtojoule ultrafast light pulses with a temporal sampling size down to 16 femtoseconds. This time-domain analogy of the single-pixel imaging shows similar advantages to its spatial counterparts: a good measurement efficiency, a high sensitivity, robustness against temporal distortions and the compatibility at multiple wavelengths."</em> <a href="http://www.hajim.rochester.edu/news/2021/2021-09-24-boyd-tpsi.html">[...]</a>

Lasers, devices that emit light in one direction, with photons traveling at one specific frequency and all with the same phase (coherent), govern the way we communicate today. Although lasers are known to most people as little torches emitting high purity color beams, the workhorse of lasers is actually in the infrared part of spectrum, where our eyes cannot see. The reason for this is that optical fibers are highly transparent to the infrared (1.3-1.6 um), allowing efficient optical transmission with very high data rates. Moreover, infrared lasers have minimum overlap with ambient light and are considered eye-safe, allowing their use in LIDAR (light detection and ranging) applications for 3D imaging, automotive and free-space communications. To date, infrared lasers are mainly made with Erbium-doped fibers or III-V epitaxial semiconductors1, imposing certain limitations in their manufacturing and their easy integration with electronics."</em> <a href="https://www.icfo.eu/newsroom/news/5153-quantum-dots-enable-infrared-lasing-at-room-temperature-for-silicon-photonics">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The world’s population is getting older. Studies show that companies will have to adjust their products and marketing channels for older crowds. A well known problem is for elderly people to be able to enjoy their TV as they are not confident with their ability to get to the desired content, and also concern of “breaking it”, taking the TV out of order until someone will fix it for them. Many of those concerns are caused by our standard remote controls which contains over 30 different buttons over very small space even though most of us barely use more than 5. Our remote changes how we think of remotes from a tiny, light device with a noisy interface- To an accessible, clean interface that is designated for elderly users. Bigger buttons, with the vital minimum number of them should provide friendly interface for the users."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Sababox-Elderly-Friendly-Remote-Control/">[...]</a>

That project has only limited features ( even without a facility for time setting ) due to constraints in getting sufficient no of pins on Arduino Nano to write the program. Here by adding an InfraRed remote, it give me flexibility of incorporating all the features that requires ( may be more if required), with out the need of extra pins and also avoiding slide and push switches. Also IR remote make the clock very compact and convenient to set and use. Also avoiding bread board, jumpers etc, I used a home made PCB to make the project compact and an usable for normal home use I am publishing this project as a new one, since the previous project’s sketch was extensively changed to incorporate IR remote and adding additional features, and also it is a finished project."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/ajithbahul/digital-clock-with-ir-remote-control-using-arduino-nano-807848">[...]</a>

Since I first mentioned the word in an Instructable and got a couple questions about it, every new BEAM Instructable I feel the need to explain my understanding of the term "BEAM robotics". Wikipedia will tell you that BEAM stands for Biology Electronics Aesthetics and Mechanics, and though I have heard conflicting theories about the name in the past I do feel that BEAM embodies these aspects. It is a style of electronics developed in the late 90s and early 2000s using mostly found components in ways that are quite elegant or clever, in order to create the most basic intelligent robots. This particular style of robot know as a photovore, phototrope or photopopper, meaning it uses some very simple logic to locomote toward light. Making tiny photopoppers has been done before, indeed even I have tried (in the video you can see my attempt from 2018 built on a PCB I designed), but I am really happy with how this particular one turned out and am excited to share the process with you all!."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Tiny-Solar-Powered-Light-Seeking-BEAM-Bot-Mini-Pho/">[...]</a>
