<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1854, o matemático, físico e astrônomo francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9">Henri Poincaré</a>. Ele, na sua conjectura, afirma que se qualquer loop num determinado espaço tridimensional pode ser reduzido a um ponto, o espaço é equivalente a uma esfera. O problema permaneceu sem solução até que Grigori Perelman provou ser uma prova completa em 2003. Poincaré influenciou a cosmogonia, a relatividade e a topologia. Em matemática aplicada, ele também estudou óptica, electricidade, telegrafia, capilaridade, elasticidade, termodinâmica, teoria do potencial, teoria quântica e cosmologia. Ele é frequentemente descrito como o último universalista em matemática. Ele estudou o problema dos três corpos na mecânica celeste e as teorias da luz e das ondas electromagnéticas. Ele foi um co-descobridor (com Albert Einstein e Hendrik Lorentz) da teoria da relatividade especial.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1893, o Cientista norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Urey">Harold Urey</a>. Ele recebeu o Prémio Nobel de Química em 1934 pela sua descoberta do deutério, a forma pesada do hidrogénio (1932). Ele foi activo no desenvolvimento da bomba atómica. Ele contribuiu para a base crescente da teoria do que era amplamente aceito como a origem da Terra e de outros planetas. Em 1953, Stanley L. Miller e Urey simularam o efeito de um raio na atmosfera pré-biótica da Terra com uma descarga eléctrica numa mistura de hidrogénio, metano, amónia e água. Isto produziu uma rica mistura de aldeídos e carboxílicos e aminoácidos (como encontrados nas proteínas, adenina e outras bases de ácido nucléico). Urey calculou a temperatura dos oceanos antigos a partir da quantidade de certos isótopos em conchas fósseis.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1894, a física nuclear austríaca <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marietta_Blau">Marietta Blau</a>. Ela começou como uma estudante forte em matemática e física na escola e estudou física na universidade, onde escreveu sua tese sobre a absorção de raios gama (1919). No início, ela conseguiu um emprego (1921) com um fabricante de tubos de raios-X em Berlim. Em 1923, ela começou a pesquisar radioactividade com o Institut für Radiumforschung em Viena. Lá ela desenvolveu a técnica de emulsão fotográfica para o estudo da desintegração nuclear causada por raios cósmicos, e contribuiu para o desenvolvimento de tubos foto-multiplicadores. Blau foi a primeira a usar emulsões nucleares para detectar neutrões observando o recuo dos protões.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou a NASA, fez o drone Ingenuity voar mais rápido e mais longe no terceiro voo em Marte. O Ingenuity Mars Helicopter da NASA continua a bater recordes, voando mais rápido e mais longe no passado domingo, 25 de Abril de 2021, do que em qualquer teste que tenha feito na Terra. O helicóptero descolou às 4h31 EDT (1h31 PDT), ou 12h33 hora local de Marte, subindo 5 metros - a mesma altitude que no seu segundo voo. Em seguida, deslocou-se rapidamente 50 metros, pouco mais da metade do comprimento de um campo de futebol, atingindo uma velocidade máxima de 2 metros por segundo.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou foi lançado o Kernel 5.12 do Linux. Mais uma vez Linus Torvalds anunciou o lançamento na lista de discussão do kernel do Linux, escrevendo: “… obrigado a todos que me tornaram muito calmos na semana passada, o que me deixou muito mais feliz com o lançamento final do 5.12”. De entre as novidades deste novo Kernel, destaca-se o suporte para os controladores da Nintendo 64, para os controladores dualsense da PS5, suporte para a tecnologia Adaptative Sync da Intel, mapeamento de UID em filesystems para já em FAT e ext4. Foi também melhorado o suporte para o laptops Surface da Microsoft, suporte NUMA na arquitectura RISC-V, Boot do Linux como partição root do Hypervisor da Microsoft, suporte para o hypervisor ACRN, nova ferramenta de debugging de memória kfence, remoção de um conjunto de plataformas obsoletas de ARM.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou foi lançada a nova versão da distribuição de Linux Fedora. O Fedora 34 introduz a nova versão do GNOME 40. Passa também a usar um novo sistema de audio e video designado por Pipewire. Foi melhorado o suporte do Wayland em cima de placas gráficas NVidia. O Fedora passa a usar o Kernel 5.11 assim como o GCC 11.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker assim como alguns videos interessantes. É apresentada a revista MagPI Magazine nº105 de Maio.</p>

<p><em>"The craft’s April 25 flight was conducted at speeds and distances beyond what had ever been previously demonstrated, even in testing on Earth. NASA’s Ingenuity Mars Helicopter continues to set records, flying faster and farther on Sunday, April 25, 2021 than in any tests it went through on Earth. The helicopter took off at 4:31 a.m. EDT (1:31 a.m. PDT) , or 12:33 p.m. local Mars time, rising 16 feet (5 meters) – the same altitude as its second flight. Then it zipped downrange 164 feet (50 meters), just over half the length of a football field, reaching a top speed of 6.6 feet per second (2 meters per second). After data came back from Mars starting at 10:16 a.m. EDT (7:16 a.m. PDT), Ingenuity’s team at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California was ecstatic to see the helicopter soaring out of view. They’re already digging through a trove of information gathered during this third flight that will inform not just additional Ingenuity flights but possible Mars rotorcraft in the future."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-flies-faster-farther-on-third-flight">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2021/04/new-linux-5-12-kernel-features">Linux Kernel 5.12 Released, This is What’s New</a></h2>

<p><em>"The Linux 5.12 kernel has been released – albeit a week later than original scheduled. Linus Torvalds announced the release over on the Linux kernel mailing list, writing: “…thanks to everybody who made last week very calm indeed, which just makes me feel much happier about the final 5.12 release.” He adds that despite the extra week’s grace this is “actually a fairly small release overall”. I reckon Linus’ definition of ‘small’ may differ from ours, so read on to run through the biggest changes and most notable additions proffered in the latest Linux kernel update. Most of us expect a new kernel releases to come with support for new hardware, but there are plenty of legacy devices out there that which are perfectly functional machines. For example, Linux 5.12 adds support for the Nintendo 64 —yes: the Nintendo 64! Don’t expect to see a full Linux desktop up and running on the 25 year old console yet, but this kernel update adds support for the system, Nintendo 64 game controllers, and Nintendo 64 data cartridges."</em> <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2021/04/new-linux-5-12-kernel-features">[...]</a>

<p><em>"After the Perseverance rover’s landing on Mars, the world marveled at the remarkable new images from the planet’s surface. Earthlings can’t get enough of the Red Planet. And unbeknownst to most — even to some of the engineers who've been involved (more on that later) — NASA’s Mars 2020 Perseverance rover contains a vital piece of Intel-based tech that’s helping get these images beamed back to us. After traveling 293 million miles from Earth, the Perseverance spacecraft plummeted at 10,000 mph (16,000 kph) into the thin Martian atmosphere on Feb. 18, 2021. It deployed a 70-foot-wide red-striped parachute, slowed to 200 mph (320 kph), fired its eight hydrazine descent engines — and stuck the landing. We all saw the video: Hovering about 66 feet (20 meters) above Jezero Crater, the descent stage’s sky crane gently winched the 1-ton (Earth weight) Perseverance rover down onto the surface of the Red Planet."</em> <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/new-views-mars-thanks-intel-tech.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter successfully completed its second Mars flight on April 22 – the 18th sol, or Martian day, of its experimental flight test window. Lasting 51.9 seconds, the flight added several new challenges to the first, which took place on April 19, including a higher maximum altitude, longer duration, and sideways movement. “So far, the engineering telemetry we have received and analyzed tell us that the flight met expectations and our prior computer modeling has been accurate,” said Bob Balaram, chief engineer for the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. “We have two flights of Mars under our belts, which means that there is still a lot to learn during this month of Ingenuity.” For this second flight test at “Wright Brothers Field,” Ingenuity took off again at 5:33 a.m. EDT (2:33 a.m. PDT), or 12:33 p.m. local Mars time. But where Flight One topped out at 10 feet (3 meters) above the surface, Ingenuity climbed to 16 feet (5 meters) this time. After the helicopter hovered briefly, its flight control system performed a slight (5-degree) tilt, allowing some of the thrust from the counter-rotating rotors to accelerate the craft sideways for 7 feet (2 meters)."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-logs-second-successful-flight">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Crystallizing salts can grow “legs,” then tip over and fall away, potentially helping to prevent fouling of metal surfaces, researchers find. About a quarter of a percent of the entire gross domestic product of industrialized countries is estimated to be lost through a single technical issue: the fouling of heat exchanger surfaces by salts and other dissolved minerals. This fouling lowers the efficiency of multiple industrial processes and often requires expensive countermeasures such as water pretreatment. Now, findings from MIT could lead to a new way of reducing such fouling, and potentially even enable turning that deleterious process into a productive one that can yield saleable products. The findings are the result of years of work by recent MIT graduates Samantha McBride PhD ’20 and Henri-Louis Girard PhD ’20 with professor of mechanical engineering Kripa Varanasi. The work, reported today in the journal Science Advances, shows that due to a combination of hydrophobic (water repelling) surfaces and heat, dissolved salts can crystallize in a way that makes it easy to remove them from the surface, in some cases by gravity alone."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/salt-metal-surfaces-0428">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Study explores the mechanical properties of these materials as they evolve from elastic gels to glassy solids. Researchers at MIT have developed a new method for determining the structure and behavior of a class of widely used soft materials known as weak colloidal gels, which are found in everything from cosmetics to building materials. The study characterizes the gels over their entire evolution, as they change from mineral solutions to elastic gels and then glassy solids. The work uncovers the microstructural mechanisms underlying how the gels change naturally over time, and how their elastic properties also change, both over time and depending on the rate at which they are experimentally deformed. This characterization should allow further study, prediction, and perhaps manipulation of the gels’ behavior, opening doors to advances in such areas as drug delivery and food production, in which these gels are common ingredients, as well as in applications ranging from water purification to nuclear waste disposal, which use these colloidal gels in a crystallized, porous form known as zeolites. “We believe this new overall picture and understanding of the gelation and subsequent aging process is of great importance for material scientists who work on soft matter,” says Gareth McKinley, the School of Engineering Professor of Teaching Innovation and professor of mechanical engineering at MIT."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/colloidal-gels-structure-0427">[...]</a>

<p><em>"New technique reclaims nearly 100% of all-carbon-based transistors while retaining future functionality of the materials Engineers at Duke University have developed the world’s first fully recyclable printed electronics. By demonstrating a crucial and relatively complex computer component — the transistor — created with three carbon-based inks, the researchers hope to inspire a new generation of recyclable electronics to help fight the growing global epidemic of electronic waste. The work appears online April 26 in the journal Nature Electronics. “Silicon-based computer components are probably never going away, and we don’t expect easily recyclable electronics like ours to replace the technology and devices that are already widely used,” said Aaron Franklin, the Addy Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Duke. “But we hope that by creating new, fully recyclable, easily printed electronics and showing what they can do, that they might become widely used in future applications.” As people worldwide adopt more electronics into their lives, there’s an ever-growing pile of discarded devices that either don’t work anymore or have been cast away in favor of a newer model. According to a United Nations estimate, less than a quarter of the millions of pounds of electronics thrown away each year is recycled."</em> <a href="https://pratt.duke.edu/about/news/recyclable-printed-electronics">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A new way to form self-aligned ‘color centers’ promises scalability to over 10,000 qubits for applications in quantum sensing and quantum computing. Achieving the immense promise of quantum computing requires new developments at every level, including the computing hardware itself. A Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab)-led international team of researchers has discovered a way to use ion beams to create long strings of “color center” qubits in diamond. Their work is detailed in the journal Applied Physics Letters. The authors includes several from Berkeley Lab: Arun Persaud, who led the study, and Thomas Schenkel, head of the Accelerator Technology and Applied Physics (ATAP) Division’s Fusion Science &amp; Ion Beam Technology Program, as well as Casey Christian (now with Berkeley Lab’s Physics Division), Edward Barnard of Berkeley Lab’s Molecular Foundry, and ATAP affiliate Russell E. Lake. Creating large numbers of high-quality quantum bits (qubits), in close enough proximity for coupling to each other, is one of the great challenges of quantum computing."</em> <a href="https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2021/04/27/ion-beams-mean-a-quantum-leap/">[...]</a>

Gas turbine buckets have to withstand extreme conditions: They are exposed to tremendous centrifugal forces under high pressure and at high temperatures. In order to further maximize energy yields, the buckets have to hold up to temperatures which are actually higher than the melting point of the material."</em> <a href="https://www.tum.de/nc/en/about-tum/news/press-releases/details/36587/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The scientific community is focusing its research into the multiple applications of Hydrogels, polymeric materials which contains a large amount of water, that have the potential to reproduce the features of biological tissues. This aspect is particularly significant in the field of regenerative medicine, which since a long time has already recognised and been using the characteristics of these materials. In order to be used effectively to replace organic tissues, hydrogels must meet two essential requirements: possessing great geometric complexity and, after suffering of a damage, being able to self-heal independently, exactly like living tissues. The development of these materials may now be easier, and cheaper, thanks to the use of 3D printing: the researchers in the MP4MNT (Materials and Processing for Micro and Nanotechnologies) team of the Department of Applied Science and Technology of the Politecnico di Torino, coordinated by Professor Fabrizio Pirri, have demonstrated, for the first time, the possibility of manufacturing hydrogels with complex architectures capable of self-healing following a laceration, thanks to 3D printing activated by light. The research was published by the prestigious journal Nature Communication in an article entitled “3D-printed self-healing hydrogels via Digital Light Processing” (DOI 10.1038/s41467-021-22802-z). Up to now, hydrogels either with self-healing properties or modellable in complex architectures using 3D printing, had already been created in the laboratory, but in the present case, the discovered solution encompasses both features: architectural complexity and the ability to self-heal following damage."</em> <a href="https://poliflash.polito.it/en/research_innovation/new_frontier_for_3d_printing_developed_state_of_the_art_soft_materials_able_to_self_heal">[...]</a>

However, those currently on the market emit a lot of blue light, which has been linked to eye troubles and sleep disturbances. Now, researchers reporting in ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces have developed a prototype LED that reduces — instead of masks — the blue component, while also making colors appear just as they do in natural sunlight. LED light bulbs are popular because of their low energy consumption, long lifespan and ability to turn on and off quickly. Inside the bulb, an LED chip converts electrical current into high-energy light, including invisible ultraviolet (UV), violet or blue wavelengths. A cap that is placed on the chip contains multiple phosphors — solid luminescent compounds that convert high-energy light into lower-energy visible wavelengths."</em> <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/presspacs/2021/acs-presspac-april-28-2021/reducing-blue-light-with-a-new-type-of-led-that-wont-keep-you-up-at-night.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Although robotic devices are used in everything from assembly lines to medicine, engineers have a hard time accounting for the friction that occurs when those robots grip objects – particularly in wet environments. Researchers have now discovered a new law of physics that accounts for this type of friction, which should advance a wide range of robotic technologies. “Our work here opens the door to creating more reliable and functional haptic and robotic devices in applications such as telesurgery and manufacturing,” says Lilian Hsiao, an assistant professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at North Carolina State University and corresponding author of a paper on the work. At issue is something called elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) friction, which is the friction that occurs when two solid surfaces come into contact with a thin layer of fluid between them. This would include the friction that occurs when you rub your fingertips together, with the fluid being the thin layer of naturally occurring oil on your skin. But it could also apply to a robotic claw lifting an object that has been coated with oil, or to a surgical device that is being used inside the human body."</em> <a href="https://news.ncsu.edu/2021/04/law-physics-friction-touch-fluid-robots/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scientists from the University’s Quantum Engineering Technology Labs (QETLabs) have developed an algorithm that provides valuable insights into the physics underlying quantum systems - paving the way for significant advances in quantum computation and sensing, and potentially turning a new page in scientific investigation. In physics, systems of particles and their evolution are described by mathematical models, requiring the successful interplay of theoretical arguments and experimental verification. Even more complex is the description of systems of particles interacting with each other at the quantum mechanical level, which is often done using a Hamiltonian model. The process of formulating Hamiltonian models from observations is made even harder by the nature of quantum states, which collapse when attempts are made to inspect them. In the paper, Learning models of quantum systems from experiments,published in Nature Physics, quantum mechanics from Bristol’s QET Labs describe an algorithm which overcomes these challenges by acting as an autonomous agent, using machine learning to reverse engineer Hamiltonian models. The team developed a new protocol to formulate and validate approximate models for quantum systems of interest."</em> <a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2021/april/quantum-machine-learning-algorithm.html">[...]</a>

Many raw materials used in the batteries, such as cobalt, may soon be in short supply. The European Commission is preparing a new battery decree, which would require the recycling of 95 percent of the cobalt in batteries. Yet existing battery recycling methods are far from perfect. Researchers at Aalto University have now discovered that electrodes in lithium batteries containing cobalt can be reused as is after being newly saturated with lithium. In comparison to traditional recycling, which typically extracts metals from crushed batteries by melting or dissolving them, the new process saves valuable raw materials, and likely also energy."</em> <a href="https://www.aalto.fi/en/news/battery-parts-can-be-recycled-without-crushing-or-melting">[...]</a>

However, lingering concerns about flammability have limited widespread use of hydrogen as a power source for electric vehicles. Previous advances have minimized the risk, but new research from the University of Georgia now puts that risk in the rearview mirror. Hydrogen vehicles can refuel much more quickly and go farther without refueling than today’s electric vehicles, which use battery power. But one of the final hurdles to hydrogen power is securing a safe method for detecting hydrogen leaks.

This particular stage will hold a DSLR and be controlled via a C# Desktop App. All I really need is a Goto position function - so this motor is fine (No encoder, just a homing limit switch). This Arduino Leonardo-type board is great because it is designed for keyboard feedback, so the serial communication implementation went very smoothly. The next step was to take apart what I had on the table and breadboard it.

<p><em>"Purpose If there’s one criticism I hear more often than any other about the pi, it’s “I wish my Raspberry Pi had a floppy drive“. It’s really shocking that the pi doesn’t have the ubiquitous 34-pin floppy header that we all know and love. How else are you supposed to interface your Tandon TM100-2A or your Teac FD-55BR or even, for you cutting edge folks, your Sony MFP290 3.5” high density drive? So I set along to create this much needed had, the missing link between the raspberry pi and the floppy disk drive. Design I’ve used the WD37C65 floppy controller IC a few times in the past, most notably as part of a floppy interface project for the RC2014 computer. I’ve previously played with the RomWBW CP/M distribution for the RC2014, and the floppy drive that’s contained as part of it."</em> <a href="https://www.smbaker.com/raspberry-pi-floppy-controller-board">[...]</a>

The new messenger device is now based on the Heltec LoRa32 V2 development board, instead of the TTGO. There are a number of reasons, but the biggest one being that this board supports a deep sleep mode where the LoRa radio can remain listening for packets! As a result, testing with the same battery, the old model could standby for about 8 hours on one charge, and the new model can now do about 48 hours. A huge improvement. A summary of the differences are: Now uses Heltec board (with deep sleep mode) Does not use SD Card."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/scottpowell69/a-better-lora-qwerty-messenger-b6e853">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Combine TensorFlow.js with Node-RED to create AI-enabled Node-RED applications in various environments Lowering the barrier to entry for artificial intelligence (AI) is a goal that is continually strived for. Making AI more widely accessible will not only increase the number of people who actually use AI, but it will also help increase the spread and adoption of AI across many different fields. The world of machine learning can be daunting at first, but there are several approaches to simplify the entire AI app development process. One of these approaches is by combining the use of TensorFlow.js with Node-RED. This tutorial shows you how to use this approach to create AI-enabled Node-RED applications in various environments. What is Node-RED?"</em> <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/technologies/artificial-intelligence/tutorials/building-a-machine-learning-node-for-node-red-using-tensorflowjs/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Have you ever stared at the ceiling and found it hard to fall asleep? Try this ESP8266 powered projector! Motivation Once in a while I found it hard to fall asleep, and stared at the ceiling for a long time. I wished there can be some random patterns showing on the ceiling to help me relax. It certainly should not be a real projector that is too bright, nor a smartphone that can only distract. Implementation I tried to make such a projector using an ESP8266 and a small LCD screen."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/tinkerdoodle/help-you-sleep-with-an-esp8266-projector-21f58a">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A simple array of a few Particle Argons to monitor and report environmental conditions of a mesh network of several spaces. The basis for this project was to utilize a collection of Particle Argons to gather, publish, and chart data pertaining to environmental conditions. The purpose of this data is to aid in the monitoring of a room or space remotely over the internet, as opposed to requiring a physical connection. This allows for separate spaces to be observed from anywhere with internet access. The way this works is through the utilization of the Particle.publish and Particle.subscribe functions provided by the Particle API. These functions send and receive messages from other devices in your network."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/gusdawg924/iot-based-air-monitoring-mesh-system-71879a">[...]</a>

<p><em>"“How is the weather?” In modern times, for a reliable answer to that question, you’re much better off asking a machine than a human. Wouldn’t it be fun to build such a device yourself? With that in mind, in this project article, Mark explains how to build your own hobby weather station that is solar powered, runs over Wi-Fi and logs all its data to Adafruit IO. If there is one topic that consistently comes up in small talk, it is the weather. In many of those conversations a huge topic is the unreliability of weather forecasts. In reality, there can be a marked difference in weather even the short distance between me and the nearest government weather station."</em> <a href="https://circuitcellar.com/research-design-hub/projects/build-a-solar-powered-weather-station/">[...]</a>
