<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1690 o matemático russo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Goldbach">Christian Goldbach</a>. Ele deu contribuições para a teoria dos números que incluem a conjectura de Goldbach, formulada numa carta a Leonhard Euler datada de 7 de Julho de 1742. Declarada em termos modernos, ela propõe que: "Todo o número natural par maior que 2 é igual à soma de dois números primos." Ele foi verificado através de um computador em busca de um grande número - até pelo menos 4 x 10^14 - mas ainda não foi comprovado. Goldbach fez outra conjectura de que cada número ímpar é a soma de três primos, nos quais Vinogradov fez progresso em 1937. (Foi verificado por computador para grandes números, mas permanece sem comprovação.) Goldbach também estudou somas infinitas, a teoria das curvas e a teoria das equações.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1796, o matemático suíço <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakob_Steiner">Jakob Steiner</a>. Ele foi um dos maiores contribuintes da geometria projectiva. Ele descobriu a superfície de Steiner, que tem uma dupla infinidade de secções cónicas. O teorema de Steiner afirma que os dois lápis pelos quais uma cónica é projectada de dois de seus pontos são projectivamente relacionados. Ele também é conhecido pelo teorema de Poncelet-Steiner, que mostra que apenas um determinado círculo e uma linha recta são necessários para as construções euclidianas. O seu trabalho incluiu secções e superfícies cónicas, a teoria das superfícies de segundo grau e problemas de centro de gravidade. Ele desenvolveu o princípio de simetrização (1840-41). Em 1848, ele foi o primeiro a definir várias curvas polares em relação a uma dada curva e introduziu as "Curvas de Steiner".</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1858 o engenheiro alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Diesel">Rudolf Diesel</a>. Ele inventou o motor de combustão interna que tem o seu nome. Depois de estudar os motores de combustão interna de quatro tempos desenvolvidos por Nikolaus Otto, Diesel concebeu um motor que se aproximaria do limite termodinâmico estabelecido por Sadi Carnot em 1824. Se o combustível num cilindro pudesse ser expandido a pressão constante, ele poderia-se aproximar do Limite de Carnot. Ele patenteou o conceito em 1892, enquanto trabalhava na empresa do engenheiro de refrigeração Carl von Linde em Berlim.</p>

<p>E nesta semana que passou um foguetão Falcon 9 lançou um novo conjunto de 60 satélites da Internet Starlink em órbita na manhã de domingo (14 de Março) e acertou a sua aterragem no mar para encerrar uma missão recorde. O veterano foguetão Falcon 9 é o primeiro da frota da SpaceX a lançar e pousar um recorde de nove vezes. O lançador de dois estágios descolou do Kennedy Space Center da NASA na Florida.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou o rover Perseverance capturou os sons da sua deslocação na superfície de Marte. Quando o rover Perseverance começou a fazer trilhos na superfície de Marte, um microfone sensível que carrega assinalou o barulho da deslocação das seis rodas do robô conforme ela se deslocavam sobre o terreno marciano.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker assim como alguns videos interessantes. É apresentada a revista HackSpace Magazine nº 41 de Abril.</p>

<p><em>"It launched 60 Starlink internet satellites into orbit. A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched a new batch of 60 Starlink internet satellites into orbit early Sunday (March 14) and nailed its landing at sea to top off a record-setting mission. The veteran Falcon 9 rocket is the first in SpaceX's fleet to launch and land a record nine times. The two-stage launcher blasted off from Pad 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center here in Florida at 6:01 a.m. EDT (1101 GMT). Approximately nine minutes later, the reusable rocket's first stage returned to Earth to attempt its ninth landing on SpaceX's drone ship "Of Course I Still Love You" stationed out in the Atlantic Ocean. The flight comes just days after the company's last launch, where a different Falcon 9 rocket took off from neighboring Space Launch Complex 40, at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-starlink-21-internet-satellites-launch-rocket-landing-success">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Toshiba Electronic Devices &amp; Storage Corporation ("Toshiba") has launched “TCD2726DG,” a lens reduction type CCD linear image sensor that achieves high-speed scanning for A3 multifunction printers. Shipments of engineering samples[1] start today. There is growing demand for A3 multifunction printers with higher scanning speeds. TCD2726DG meets the demand by improving the performance with a faster operating clock rate: a 100MHZ (50MHz x 2ch) data rate, against the 70MHz (35MHz x 2ch) data rate of Toshiba’s current sensor. To prevent increased electromagnetic interference (EMI), a negative side effect of a faster clock rate, the new sensor incorporates a timing generator circuit and has a lower CCD driver pin count. This reduces EMI- and timing-adjustment work for customers, and the number of peripheral parts, contributing to easier system development."</em> <a href="https://toshiba.semicon-storage.com/ap-en/company/news/news-topics/2021/03/sensor-20210317-1.html">[...]</a>

While the LEAF isn’t the most popular electric vehicle on the market, having been around for years longer than other EVs has allowed Nissan to work out some of the challenges associated with aging electric vehicle batteries. The main challenge is want to do with an electric vehicle battery after it no longer has the capacity to be useful in a vehicle. Nissan has found a second-life for old LEAF batteries inside mobile machines that help workers at Nissan factories worldwide. The old batteries are being used in automated guided vehicles or AGVs used for various tasks inside the manufacturing facilities, including delivering parts to workers on the assembly line.

As researchers push the boundaries of battery design, seeking to pack ever greater amounts of power and energy into a given amount of space or weight, one of the more promising technologies being studied is lithium-ion batteries that use a solid electrolyte material between the two electrodes, rather than the typical liquid. But such batteries have been plagued by a tendency for branch-like projections of metal called dendrites to form on one of the electrodes, eventually bridging the electrolyte and shorting out the battery cell. Now, researchers at MIT and elsewhere have found a way to prevent such dendrite formation, potentially unleashing the potential of this new type of high-powered battery. The findings are described in the journal Nature Energy, in a paper by MIT graduate student Richard Park, professors Yet-Ming Chiang and Craig Carter, and seven others at MIT, Texas A&amp;M University, Brown University, and Carnegie Mellon University.

When lightning strikes sand, soil or stone, it immediately melts the materials into a glassy clump known as a fulgurite, or lightning rock. When geologists excavated the fulgurite in Illinois, they found something unexpected inside — an important ingredient for life that had long been thought to be delivered to early Earth by meteorites."</em> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/16/977769884/how-a-building-block-of-life-got-created-in-a-flash?t=1616104428013">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In 2017, the first interstellar object from beyond our solar system was discovered via the Pan-STARRS astronomical observatory in Hawaii. It was named ‘Oumuamua, meaning "scout" or "messenger" in Hawaiian. The object was like a comet, but with features that were just odd enough to defy classification. Two Arizona State University astrophysicists, Steven Desch and Alan Jackson of the School of Earth and Space Exploration, set out to explain the odd features of ‘Oumuamua and have determined that it is likely a piece of a Pluto-like planet from another solar system. Their findings have been recently published in a pair of papers (part I and part II) in the AGU Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets. “In many ways ‘Oumuamua resembled a comet, but it was peculiar enough in several ways that mystery surrounded its nature, and speculation ran rampant about what it was,” said Desch, who is a professor in the School of Earth and Space Exploration."</em> <a href="https://news.asu.edu/20210316-asu-scientists-determine-origin-strange-interstellar-object">[...]</a>

Cornell researchers have created micron-sized shape memory actuators that enable atomically thin two-dimensional materials to fold themselves into 3D configurations. All they require is a quick jolt of voltage. And once the material is bent, it holds its shape – even after the voltage is removed.

<p><em>"We fabricate a novel molybdenum disulfide transistor and create an image of the spins of the electrons passing through which may open the way for new spintronic computers The collaboration of the University of Tsukuba (Tsukuba, Japan) and the Institute of High Pressure Physics (Warsaw, Poland) detected and mapped the electronic spins moving in a working transistor made of molybdenum disulfide. This research may lead to much faster computers that take advantage of the natural magnetism of electrons, as opposed to just their charge. Spintronics is a new area of condensed matter physics that attempts to use the intrinsic magnetic moment of electrons, called “spins,” to perform calculations. This would be a major advance over all existing electronics that rely solely on the electron charge. However, it is difficult to detect these spins, and there are many unknowns regarding materials that can support the transport of spin-polarized electrons. Now, an international research team led by the Division of Materials Science at the University of Tsukuba has successfully used electron spin resonance (ESR) to monitor the number and location of unpaired spins coursing through a molybdenum disulfide transistor."</em> <a href="https://devicematerialscommunity.nature.com/posts/spin-states-in-mos2-thin-film-transistors-distinguished-by-operando-electron-spin-resonance">[...]</a>

The materials they looked at are rare-earth nickelates, which are of great interest for innovating new approaches in electronics. “Phase transitions” are a central phenomenon in physical sciences. Despite being technical-sounding, they are actually something we all experience in everyday life: ice melting into liquid water, or hot water evaporating as steam. Solid, liquid, and gas are three well known “phases” and, when one turns into another, that is a phase transition. Rare-earth nickelate oxides, also called nickelates, have attracted a lot of interest from researchers because they display an electronic phase transition, which may be exploited in future electronic devices."</em> <a href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/nano-mapping-phase-transitions-in-electronic-mater/">[...]</a>

Three-dimensional perovskites have proved themselves remarkably successful materials for LED devices and solar panels in the past decade. One key issue with these materials, however, is their stability, with device performance decreasing quicker than other state-of-the-art materials. The engineering community believes the 2D variant of perovskites could provide answers to these performance issues. In a study published in The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters, researchers from Surrey's Advanced Technology Institute (ATI) detail how to improve the physical properties of 2D perovskite called Ruddlesden-Popper.

<p><em>"This project is a simple frequency meter capable of measuring frequencies up to 100MHz with an accuracy of 0.002%. Based on an ATtiny414, it demonstrates the use of Timer/Counter TCD0 and the Event System I recently wanted to design a frequency meter that would measure up to 100MHz, so you can use it to test processor clocks and crystals. There are many designs for microcontroller-based frequency meters on the web; after all, it's one of the applications that the timer/counters in most microcontrollers are designed for. However, most of them don't go as high as 100MHz because the microcontroller's own clock usually imposes an upper limit of half the clock frequency. First attempt My plan was to use the Real-Time Clock peripheral, clocked by a 32.768kHz crystal, to generate a 1Hz interrupt. A second timer/counter, clocked by the frequency being measured, would then count the number of cycles in this one-second interval."</em> <a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?20B4">[...]</a>

So I designed this over a couple of months."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/lewiseab/simple-3d-printable-arduino-cnc-drawing-machine-89e405">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Tamper Detection Meshes Cryptography is at the foundation of our modern, networked world. From email to card payment infrastructure in brick and mortar stores, cryptographic keys secure almost every part of our digital lives againts cybercriminals or curious surveillance capitalists. Without cryptography, many of the things we routinely do in our lives such as paying for groceries with a credit card, messaging a friend on Signal or unlocking a car with its keyfob would not be possible. The security of all of these systems in its core lies on the secrecy of cryptographic keys. Systems differ in what kind of keys they use, how often these keys are replaced and the intricacies of the cryptographic operations these keys fit into but all have in common that their security relies on keeping the keys secret. In practice, this secrecy has been implemented in many different ways."</em> <a href="https://blog.jaseg.de/posts/kicad-mesh-plugin/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The internet isn’t exactly short of fan speed controller projects – nor am I. I’ve probably got about four or five variants of these I’ve built over the years. Recently I’ve taken the time to round up the “best of” these into a single open-source friendly AVR based project. Historically it was based on PIC microcontrollers, using various expensive proprietary compilers – the main reason I’ve not released it to-date. The initial reason I embarked on this is because back 10 or so years ago when I first built one, PC motherboards lacked intelligent fan speed control, and if they did have it, it was limited to the point of being practically useless. The situation is a lot better these days, but the level of control sometimes desired isn’t a given. I still have quite a few of these in use for non PC scenarios, for example, inside networking equipment with excessively noisy overkill cooling arrangements."</em> <a href="http://www.mattmillman.com/projects/another-intelligent-4-wire-fan-speed-controller/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In short, RS485 is a standard defining the electrical characteristics of serial lines for use in serial communications systems. It is essentially a form of serial communication. It may sound complicated for those who don’t know what is serial communication, so here’s an explanation. What is Serial Communication? Serial communication is a way to send data. It is like the Universal Serial Bus (USB) or ethernet that we can find in many of our modern computers."</em> <a href="https://www.seeedstudio.com/blog/2021/03/18/how-rs485-works-and-how-to-implement-rs485-into-industrial-control-systems/">[...]</a>
