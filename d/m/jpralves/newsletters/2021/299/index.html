<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1743, o inventor americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fitch_(inventor)">John Fitch</a>. Ele foi pioneiro do transporte de barcos a vapor que produziu barcos a vapor utilizáveis antes de Robert Fulton. Fitch encontrou apoio privado, então rapidamente construiu um motor com recursos dos motores a vapor de Watt e Newcomen. Ele evoluiu de erro em erro até fazer o primeiro barco a vapor. Era uma máquina estranha - movida por um suporte de remos de canoa indiana. Ainda assim, no verão de 1790, Fitch usou-o numa linha de passageiros de sucesso entre Filadélfia e Trenton. Em 26 de Agosto de 1791, John Fitch recebeu uma patente dos EUA para o barco a vapor.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1868, o químico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Hoffmann">Felix Hoffmann</a>. Ele descobriu a aspirina, enquanto pesquisador da Bayer &amp; Co. No início, ele considerou a farmácia, mas voltou-se para a química. Ele obteve um Ph.D. e de seguida, ingressou na empresa de Friedrich Bayer em 1894. Ele estava interessado em encontrar um analgésico melhor para o reumatismo crónico do seu pai, para substituir o uso de ácido salicílico, que tinha um sabor amargo e causava dores de estômago. A 10 de Agosto de 1897, ele formou um derivado, ácido acetilsalicílico (C9H8O4), acetilando ácido salicílico com ácido acético. Os testes da empresa mostraram que era um medicamento seguro e eficaz para alívio da dor, redução da febre e como anti-inflamatório. Foi comercializado a partir de 1899.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1874, o matemático francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9-Louis_Baire">René-Louis Baire</a>. Ele dedicou-se ao estudo de números irracionais e cujo conceito de dividir a noção de continuidade em semi-continuidade superior e inferior influenciou muito a Escola Francesa de Matemática. A sua tese de doutorado levou à solução do problema da propriedade característica de funções limitadas de funções contínuas e ajudou a estabelecer a teoria das funções de variáveis reais.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1912, o bioquímico alemão-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konrad_Emil_Bloch">Konrad Emil Bloch</a>. Ele partilhou o Prémio Nobel de Fisiologia ou Medicina de 1964 com Feodor Lynen pelas suas descobertas a respeito da síntese natural de colesterol e de ácidos gordos. Bloch identificou o processo químico pelo qual o corpo transforma o ácido acético em colesterol. Ele descobriu o ponto em que é possível regular a quantidade de colesterol que o corpo produz. Ele descobriu que altos níveis de colesterol na corrente sanguínea causam depósitos de gordura nas paredes internas das artérias, o que pode levar à redução do fluxo sanguíneo e aumentar as hipóteses de coagulação do sangue e ataque cardíaco.</p>

<p>Faz hoje 45 anos que foi introduzido o voo supersónico comercial. Foram feitos nessa data dois voos, um a partir do aeroporto Heathrow de Londres com destino ao Bahrein, no Golfo Pérsico. O outro voo a partir do Aeroporto de Orly, em Paris, para o Rio de Janeiro, Brasil, via Senegal, na África Ocidental. O <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde">Concorde</a> tinha motores duas vezes mais potentes que os jactos normais, a sua velocidade de cruzeiro de 2.172 Km/h era o dobro da velocidade do som (Mach 2,04) e reduziu pela metade o tempo das viagens aéreas, a uma altitude de cruzeiro de 60.000 pés (17.700 m). O seu enorme custo de produção foi repartido entre os governos da Grã-Bretanha e da França. Os desafios técnicos incluíram a construção da estrutura da aeronave para suportar a pressão imensa de ondas de choque e suportar altas temperaturas do atrito do ar. O Concorde tinha uma configuração de asa delta e foi o primeiro avião civil a ser equipado com um sistema de controle de voo analógico fly-by-wire. Os voos transatlânticos regulares da Europa começaram para Washington D.C. em 24 de maio de 1976 e operam para Nova York em 22 de Novembro de 1977. O último voo comercial do Concorde foi a 24 de Outubro de 2003.</p>

<p>E Nesta semana que passou a Virgin Orbit conseguiu, com um voo de teste que não só atingiu seus objectivos de alcançar o espaço e a órbita, mas também de entregar cargas úteis a bordo para a NASA, marcando também sua primeira missão comercial. O lançamento foi um sucesso em todos os aspectos possíveis, o que coloca a Virgin Orbit no caminho certo para se tornar uma opção para lançamento no espaço de pequenas cargas para clientes comerciais e de defesa. Lançado a partir de um Boeing 747-400 modificado com o nome de Cosmic Girl, lançou com sucesso o foguetão LauncherOne que atingiu o espaço. Na conclusão do voo de teste, foram lançados 10 CubeSats.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou a Raspberry Pi anunciou um novo membro da família. Trata-se do Raspberry Pi Pico - uma pequena placa com dimensões parecidas com as de um Arduino Nano. No entanto trata-se de uma placa completamente diferente, ao contrario dos outros Raspberry Pi, esta não tem como objectivo a execução de um sistema operativo como o Linux mas sim, funcionar como um Arduino ou um ESP32. Foi desenhado um processador designado por RP2040 que é um Dual-core ARM Cortex M0+, com velocidade de relógio até 133 Mhz e 264KB de SRAM. A placa tem 2MB de Flash e disponibiliza 30 GPIO multi-função dos quais 4 podem ser usados como entradas analógicas, 2 interfaces SPI, 2 interfaces I2C, 2 UARTS, 16 canais de PWM e 8 IO programáveis, 1 USB 1.1 para carga e comunicação. Consegue funcionar com cerca de 100 mA @ 5 V e tem modos de suspensão com retenção de memória total abaixo de 1 mA. O custo também é uma surpresa agradável e fica-se abaixo dos 5 USD ou 5€.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos assim como projetos de maker. É apresentada a revista Hackspace Magazine nº 39 e o livro "Get Started with MicroPython on Raspberry Pi Pico".</p>

<h2><a href="https://virginorbit.com/the-latest/virgin-orbit-aces-second-launch-demo-and-deploys-nasa-payloads/">Virgin Orbit Aces Second Launch Demo and Deploys NASA Payloads</a></h2>

<p><em>"Virgin Orbit, the California-based satellite launch company, confirmed that its LauncherOne rocket reached space during the company’s second launch demonstration today, successfully deploying 10 payloads for NASA’s Launch Services Program (LSP). Virgin Orbit’s novel launch system uses a technique called air launch, in which a rocket is launched from under the wing of a jet aircraft, rather than from a traditional launch pad on the ground. In addition to improving the payload capacity of the rocket, this technique allows the LauncherOne system to be the world’s most flexible and responsive launch service — flying on short notice and from a wide variety of locations to access any orbit. For today’s picture-perfect mission, Virgin Orbit’s carrier aircraft, a customized 747-400 dubbed Cosmic Girl, took off from Mojave Air and Space Port at approximately 10:50 A.M. and flew out to a launch site over the Pacific Ocean, about 50 miles south of the Channel Islands. After a smooth release from the aircraft, the two-stage rocket ignited and powered itself to orbit. At the conclusion of the flight, the LauncherOne rocket deployed 10 CubeSats into the team’s precise target orbit, marking a major step forward for Virgin Orbit in its quest to bust down the barriers preventing affordable and responsive access to space."</em> <a href="https://virginorbit.com/the-latest/virgin-orbit-aces-second-launch-demo-and-deploys-nasa-payloads/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"NVIDIA DRIVE IX cabin perception software provides advanced driver monitoring, personalization, in-cabin situational understanding and intuitive AI assistants. Even with advanced driver assistance systems automating more driving functions, human drivers must maintain their attention at the wheel and build trust in the AI system. Traditional driver monitoring systems typically don’t understand subtle cues such as a driver’s cognitive state, behavior or other activity that indicates whether they’re ready to take over the driving controls. NVIDIA DRIVE IX is an open, scalable cockpit software platform that provides AI functions to enable a full range of in-cabin experiences, including intelligent visualization with augmented reality and virtual reality, conversational AI and interior sensing. Driver perception is a key aspect of the platform that enables the AV system to ensure a driver is alert and paying attention to the road. It also enables the AI system to perform cockpit functions that are more intuitive and intelligent."</em> <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/01/19/drive-ix-ai-software-drivers-safe/">[...]</a>

When NASA’s Perseverance rover lands on Mars on Feb. 18, 2021, it will be carrying a small but mighty passenger: Ingenuity, the Mars Helicopter. The helicopter, which weighs about 4 pounds (1.8 kilograms) on Earth and has a fuselage about the size of a tissue box, started out six years ago as an implausible prospect. Engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California knew it was theoretically possible to fly in Mars’ thin atmosphere, but no one was sure whether they could build a vehicle powerful enough to fly, communicate, and survive autonomously with the extreme restrictions on its mass. Then the team had to prove in Earthbound tests that it could fly in a Mars-like environment. Now that they’ve checked off those objectives, the team is preparing to test Ingenuity in the actual environment of Mars."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/6-things-to-know-about-nasas-mars-helicopter-on-its-way-to-mars/">[...]</a>

Many modern televisions and smartphones use OLEDs to display pictures and videos. These devices can efficiently convert electricity into light because they are made from carbon-based molecules containing alternating single and double chemical bonds, an arrangement called p-conjugation. This configuration allows electrons to become highly mobile because they are effectively “delocalized” over large regions of the molecules, which tend to be long linear chains.

<p><em>"A new Columbia study indicates energy can be extracted from black holes through reconnection of magnetic field lines. A remarkable prediction of Einstein's theory of general relativity—the theory that connects space, time, and gravity—is that rotating black holes have enormous amounts of energy available to be tapped. For the last 50 years, scientists have tried to come up with methods to unleash this power. Nobel physicist Roger Penrose theorized that a particle disintegration could draw energy from a black hole; Stephen Hawking proposed that black holes could release energy through quantum mechanical emission; while Roger Blandford and Roman Znajek suggested electromagnetic torque as a main agent of energy extraction. Now, in a study published in the journal Physical Review D, physicists Luca Comisso from Columbia University and Felipe Asenjo from Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez in Chile, found a new way to extract energy from black holes by breaking and rejoining magnetic field lines near the event horizon, the point from which nothing, not even light, can escape the black hole’s gravitational pull. “Black holes are commonly surrounded by a hot 'soup' of plasma particles that carry a magnetic field,” said Luca Comisso, research scientist at Columbia University and first author on the study."</em> <a href="https://news.columbia.edu/energy-particles-magnetic-fields-black-holes">[...]</a>

Within the realm of renewable energy, CO2-based e-fuels have emerged as a promising technology that attempts to convert atmospheric CO2 into clean fuels. The process involves production of synthetic gas or syngas (a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide (CO)). With the help of the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, CO2 is broken down into the CO necessary for syngas. While promising in its conversion efficiency, the RWGS reaction requires incredibly high temperatures (>700°C) to proceed, while also generating unwanted byproducts.

With only three rotors working, the drone loses stability and inevitably crashes unless an emergency control strategy sets in. Researchers at the University of Zurich and the Delft University of Technology have now found a solution to this problem: They show that information from onboard cameras can be used to stabilize the drone and keep it flying autonomously after one rotor suddenly gives out.

<p><em>"X-ray experiments at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) revealed an unexpected transformation in a single atomic layer of a material that contributed to a doubling in the speed of a chemical reaction – the splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen gases. This process is a first step in producing hydrogen fuel for applications such as electric vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells. The research team, led by scientists at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, performed a unique X-ray technique and related analyses, pioneered at Berkeley Lab’s Advanced Light Source (ALS), to home in on the changes at the surface layer of the material. The ALS produces X-rays and other forms of intense light to carry out simultaneous experiments at dozens of beamlines. “There is simply no other place in the world that can do these analyses on the level that the ALS can right now,” said Slavomír Nemšák, a beamline scientist at the ALS who contributed to the study, published Jan. 11 in Nature Materials. The technique they used allowed them to probe the surface of a catalyst material called lanthanum nickel oxide (LNO) that is useful in water splitting."</em> <a href="https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2021/01/14/1-atom-deep-look-water-splitting-catalyst/">[...]</a>

In Biointerphases, published by AIP Publishing, researchers from Wageningen University in the Netherlands show how the design can use softer materials and still be strong enough to work. Probabilistic fasteners work, because they are designed with a tiny pattern on one surface that interlocks with features on the other surface. Currently available fasteners, like Velcro and 3M, are called hook and loop fasteners. That design requires harder, stiff material, which is what causes the loud ripping sound when they are peeled off and why they can damage delicate surfaces, such as fabrics, when attached to them. The team believes a 3D mushroom design can be made with softer, more flexible materials."</em> <a href="https://publishing.aip.org/publications/latest-content/fastener-with-microscopic-mushroom-design-holds-promise/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A research team from the Skoltech Center for Design, Manufacturing and Materials (CDMM) comprising 2nd year PhD student Maxim Isachenkov, Senior Research Scientist Svyatoslav Chugunov, Professor Iskander Akhatov, and Professor Igor Shishkovsky has prepared an extensive review on the use of Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies (also known as 3D-printing) in crewed lunar exploration. Their paper published in the journal Acta Astronautica contains a comprehensive description of the geological composition of the lunar surface and the properties of lunar soil (lunar regolith) and its simulants, detailing their mineralogy, morphology, and chemical composition, in the light of their future use as feedstock for 3D-printing on the Moon surface. The authors evaluated different 3D-printing techniques presented in literature in terms of their suitability for in-situ manufacturing and maintainability, with focus on the adaptation of AM methods to low gravity, limited energy consumption, dimension and weight constraints of AM components delivered to the Moon, scalability of AM technologies, low-gravity performance of 3D-printing methods, and autonomy of AM applications. According to Maxim Isachenkov, “3D-printing technologies will be one of the cornerstones of lunar exploration, providing future astronauts with a required infrastructure, spare parts, and tools via local resources utilization.” He believes that, “There is no universal 3D-printing approach capable of dealing with all these tasks. Each approach will have a niche of its own, depending on multiple factors. It would be worthwhile to develop a strategy on how to use a set of AM methods individually or in combination and select a technique best suited for a specific purpose.” The team hopes that their review will help researchers across the globe to find the most promising AM techniques for further research and development and involve more teams in these studies, which could eventually contribute to the sustainable development of the future lunar infrastructure and the expansion of human presence in space."</em> <a href="https://www.skoltech.ru/en/2021/01/3d-printing-to-pave-the-way-for-moon-colonization/">[...]</a>

When sheets of two-dimensional nanomaterials like graphene are stacked on top of each other, tiny gaps form between the sheets that have a wide variety of potential uses. In research published in the journal Nature Communications, a team of Brown University researchers has found a way to orient those gaps, called nanochannels, in a way that makes them more useful for filtering water and other liquids of nanoscale contaminants. “In the last decade, a whole field has sprung up to study these spaces that form between 2-D nanomaterials,” said Robert Hurt, a professor in Brown’s School of Engineering and coauthor of the research. “You can grow things in there, you can store things in there, and there’s this emerging field of nanofluidics where you’re using those channels to filter out some molecules while letting others go through.” There’s a problem, however, with using these nanochannels for filtration, and it has to do with the way those channels are oriented.

<p><em>"Range anxiety, the fear of running out of power before being able to recharge an electric vehicle, may be a thing of the past, according to a team of Penn State engineers who are looking at lithium iron phosphate batteries that have a range of 250 miles with the ability to charge in 10 minutes. "We developed a pretty clever battery for mass-market electric vehicles with cost parity with combustion engine vehicles," said Chao-Yang Wang, William E. Diefenderfer Chair of mechanical engineering, professor of chemical engineering and professor of materials science and engineering, and director of the Electrochemical Engine Center at Penn State. "There is no more range anxiety and this battery is affordable." The researchers also say that the battery should be good for 2 million miles in its lifetime. They report today (Jan. 18) in Nature Energy that the key to long-life and rapid recharging is the battery's ability to quickly heat up to 140 degrees Fahrenheit, for charge and discharge, and then cool down when the battery is not working.

Sunspots, for instance, reveal the degree of solar activity – the more sunspots are visible on the surface of the sun, the more active is our central star deep inside. Even though sunspots have been known since antiquity, they have only been documented in detail since the invention of the telescope around 400 years ago.

<p><em>"In a new paper published today in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Science (PNAS), planetary geologist Joe Levy, assistant professor of geology, reveals a groundbreaking new analysis of the mysterious glaciers of Mars. On Earth, glaciers covered wide swaths of the planet during the last Ice Age, which reached its peak about 20,000 years ago, before receding to the poles and leaving behind the rocks they pushed behind. On Mars, however, the glaciers never left, remaining frozen on the Red Planet’s cold surface for more than 300 million years, covered in debris. “All the rocks and sand carried on that ice have remained on the surface,” says Levy. “It’s like putting the ice in a cooler under all those sediments.” Geologists, however, haven’t been able to tell whether all of those glaciers formed during one massive Martian Ice Age, or in multiple separate events over millions of years. Since ice ages result from a shift in the tilt of a planet’s axis (known as obliquity), answering that question could tell scientists how Mars’ orbit and climate have changed over time — as well as what kind of rocks, gases, or even microbes might be trapped inside the ice."</em> <a href="https://www.colgate.edu/news/stories/colgate-planetary-geologist-publishes-groundbreaking-analysis-mysterious-martian">[...]</a>

Cooling atoms is equivalent to slowing them down, which makes them a lot easier to study. At room temperature, atoms whiz through the air at nearly the speed of sound, some 343 meters per second. The rapid, randomly moving atoms have only fleeting interactions with other particles, and their motion can make it difficult to measure transitions between atomic energy levels.

<p><em>"This device classifies human emotions, snores, sign languages, visual objects using EI and provide haptic feedback through Neosensory Buzz. When I first noticed Expand Your Senses challenge on Hackster, I told myself, this is a perfect marriage - sensory substitution with artificial intelligence! Well, what is sensory substitution? In simple words, it's a technique to supplement the lost of one sense by feeding it's information from another channel. For example, when a person goes blind, generally does not lose the ability to see, they simply lose their ability to transmit the sensory signals from the retina to brain. Since the vision processing pathways are still intact, a person who has lost the ability to retrieve data from the retina can still see subjective images by using data gathered from other sensory modalities such as touch or audio."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/mithun-das/boon-a-sensory-substitution-for-asd-better-sleep-and-more-3b1d60">[...]</a>

So I chose to develop the following solution : Each board or laptop is running a python script which gather information such as cpu speed, core temperature, disk usage... and compact them into a json message send them to my MQTT Broker The Raspberry Pi 4 (which is also the MQTT Broker) uses this information through a node red flow to build a nice (in my opinion) dashboard. The overall project is quite simple and was especially a good way to discover json format, mqtt and basic node red usage. "Client" Side On the client side the code running is based on Python 3. It gathers the following values thanks to psutils lib : Name of the host Uptime Core Temperature Virtual Memory (%) Disque usage (%) Average load (1min, 5min, 15min) CPU Usage per core (%) The value are next packed into a json message and published to MQTT broker.

<p><em>"The easiest way to save power on an ESP8266 is in fact to switch it OFF when not needed and Switch it ON when needed. A typical example of that is a notifier that mail has been delivered or a door has been opened. Opening a mailbox or opening/closing a door activates a Switch that connects the Vcc to 3V3 and the ESP8266 boots up and does its thing. This seems ideal for the ESP8266-01 that does not have gpio16 broken out and therefore is hard to use in regular deep sleep. This concept will not work though if the switch prematurely is deactivated and the ESP8266 has not finished its job yet. You need some way to keep the ESP running til it’s job is finished and this means it needs to maintain power and thus the regular ‘deep sleep’ seems the only option."</em> <a href="https://arduinodiy.wordpress.com/2021/01/15/very-deepsleep-and-energy-saving-on-esp8266-part-6-power-down-up/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This project replaces the WiFi Garage Door control base on an ESP2866 with a radio/LoRa version for greater range and includes a push button long range radio/LoRa remote for use from the car. Originally this project attempted to use an Adafruit Feather M0 LoRa board, however that board locked up repeatedly when mains powered. After trying a number of fixes, it was replaced with a Teensy 3.2 + Adafruit Teensy Adaptor + Adafruit Radio Feather Wing. The Teensy combination has proved to be completely reliable. The Adafruit Radio Feather Wing is an LoRa version but this project does not use the LoRa infrastructure. Instead a simple point-to-point connection, protected by 128 bit security, is used."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/LoRa-Controlled-Garage-Door/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This is a project that I have been meaning to finish for over a year now. it is a heart shaped, BEAM based pummer circuit I made to charge up during the day and flash like a heart beating at night. The solar engine is a SIMD1 solar engine by Wilf Rigter and the pummer is a modified version of his power saver flasher which flashes 2 LEDs off the one oscillator. My final design lasts about 3 hours from when the sun starts to go down. I personally love creating PCBs as a step up from breadboard or perfboard circuits, and I especially like designing PCBs that go a little beyond just connecting components. Hopefully through this Instructable you will see that while a PCB designer such as Eagle can be superbly powerful, creating a functional and aesthetic circuit such as the one presented here can be quick, fun and really accessible."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/BEAM-Solar-Powered-Pummer-Heart-Shaped-PCB/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The following project was born with the idea that electronics is very easy to learn and modular at the same time. Although I have already finished my Fab Academy, I am still researching. Speaking with my instructors Nuria and Pablo, I told them that I wanted to continue working on the Hello World project, but I was not satisfied with making a board for each sensor or actuator. So I decided to make a board with the ATtiny1614, where I could use the maximum pins for the inputs or outputs; that had external power; I2C connection. The idea is that a student can test as many sensors as possible, become familiar with electronics and programming little by little. And the Adrianino was born."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Adrianino-ATtiny-1614-UPDI/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Background: Formula Student the world most established educational engineering competition which uses motorsport to inspire students. Backed by industry and high-profile engineers such as Patron, Ross Brawn OBE, the competition aims to develop enterprising and innovative young engineers and encourage more young people to take up a career in engineering. The format provides an ideal opportunity for students to demonstrate their engineering knowledge and test and improve their capabilities to deliver a complex and integrated product in the demanding environment of a motorsport competition. Objective: The main function of the datalogger module is to read two CAN communication BUS and record the information present on the BUS on an SD card at a rate of 200Hz, to later analyze the information regarding the vehicle's operation. In the module developed as it is to be integrated in a vehicle to compete in the formula student event, it has incorporated other features such as: - 2 digital and 4 analog inputs with respective signal conditioning; - 4 status smd leds; - A 5V Series and 3.3V communication bus; - Lap trigger; - RTC to know exactly when the data is being recorded, - A circuit capable of detecting a power failure in the module's power supply and ordering the closing of the SD card beforehand for not to lose the data acquired. The whole system was designed with the aim of being as compact as possible."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Datalogger-System-for-Formula-Student/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In general, generating an LED fade effect requires a microcontroller or another expensive circuit. We have built this low-cost LED fading board using an inexpensive 555 Timer. The 555 timer is used as an astable multivibrator, which generates low-frequency pulses, further, this pulse train is feed to the base of BJT transistor TIP122 with a series resistor along with a high-value electrolytic capacitor. The combination of resistor R5 and capacitor C6 at the base of Q1 gradually increases and decreases the base voltage which provides soft ON/OFF (Ramp) to the load. The circuit can drive a load up to 18W without heatsink. An onboard potentiometer is provided to adjust the frequency of flash."</em> <a href="https://www.electronics-lab.com/project/led-fading-effect-led-strobe/">[...]</a>

It can be powered by a standard micro USB cable. Its user interface is very simple. User can enter menu and then change the clock parameters (time, date, month, year, alarm, etc). The alarm parameters are stored in EEPROM of ATmega 328p so it dosen't forget alarm even if the power cuts."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Digital-Clock-Using-ATmega-328pArduino-IC-RTC-/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Functional description The whole project is built around stuff I had laying around, so there should be plenty of ways pulling it off. An old keyboard (about 1988 vintage) gives the project its enclosure and "user-interface". An Arduino Nano is hooked up to the keyboards original controller and simulates the host PC and receives the keyboard inputs from the keyboard. The Arduino reads a WAV file from a FAT formatted SD card. The file name is determined by the key which was pressed so changing the sounds on the keyboard is as easy as properly naming WAV files on an SD card. The sound is output as PWM for the next stages."</em> <a href="http://peter.turczak.de/content/projects/speaking_keyboard/index.html">[...]</a>
