<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1774, o hidrógrafo irlandês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Beaufort">Francis Beaufort</a>. Ele criou a cifra  Beaufort e a escala Beaufort. A cifra Beaufort, é uma cifra de substituição semelhante à cifra de Vigenère, com um mecanismo de codificação e quadro ligeiramente modificados. A sua aplicação mais famosa foi numa máquina de criptografia baseada em rotores, a Hagelin M-209.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1840, o químico sueco <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_Fredrik_Nilson">Lars Fredrik Nilson</a>. Ele descobriu o óxido de escândio, escândia, nos minerais de terras raras gadolinita e euxenita. A existência do elemento foi prevista por Dmitry Ivanovich Mendeleyev (1871), que o chamou provisoriamente de ekaboron.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1887, o químico físico polaco-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazimierz_Fajans">Kazimierz Fajans</a>. Ele descobriu a lei do deslocamento radioactivo simultaneamente com Frederick Soddy da Grã-Bretanha. De acordo com essa lei, quando um átomo radioactivo decai emitindo uma partícula alfa, o número atómico do átomo resultante é dois a menos que o do átomo original. Ele descobriu vários elementos que são criados por meio da desintegração nuclear. A primeira descoberta do protactínio foi em 1913 por Kasimir Fajans e O. Göhring, que encontraram o isótopo protactínio-234m (meia-vida de 1,2 min), um produto da decomposição do urânio-238; eles o chamaram de brevium por sua curta vida. (Protactinium-231 foi posteriormente identificado em 1918 por outros cientistas; o nome protoactinium foi adoptado nesta época.)</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1897, o físico britânico <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cockcroft">John Cockcroft</a>. Ele partilhou (com Ernest T.S. Walton da Irlanda) o Prémio Nobel de Física de 1951 por ser o pioneiro no uso de aceleradores de partículas para estudar o núcleo atómico. Juntos, em 1929, eles construíram um acelerador, o gerador Cockcroft-Walton, que gerou um grande número de partículas com energias mais baixas - o primeiro destruidor de átomos. Em 14 de Abril de 1932, eles usaram-o para desintegrar átomos de lítio, bombardeando-os com protões, a primeira reacção nuclear artificial que não utilizou substâncias radioactivas. Eles foram os primeiros a dividir o átomo. Eles conduziram pesquisas adicionais sobre a divisão de outros átomos e estabeleceram a importância dos aceleradores como uma ferramenta para a pesquisa nuclear. O seu desenho de acelerador tornou-se um dos mais úteis nos laboratórios do mundo.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1909, o físico americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._W._Hansen">William Webster Hansen</a>. Ele contribuiu para o desenvolvimento do radar e é considerado o fundador da tecnologia de micro-ondas. Ele desenvolveu o klystron, um tubo de vácuo essencial para a tecnologia de radar (1937). Baseado na modulação de amplitude de um feixe de electrões, ao invés de circuitos ressonantes de bobinas e condensadores, ele permite a geração de oscilações de alta frequência poderosas e estáveis. Ele revolucionou a física de alta energia e a pesquisa de micro-ondas e levou ao radar aerotransportado. O klystron também tem sido usado em comunicações por satélite, sistemas de orientação de aviões e mísseis e transmissão de telefone e televisão. Após a Segunda Guerra Mundial, trabalhando com três alunos de pós-graduação, Hansen demonstrou o primeiro acelerador linear de 4,5 MeV em 1947.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1954, o físico teórico americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Krauss">Lawrence Krauss</a>. Ele foi um dos primeiros físicos a propor a enigmática energia escura que compõe a maior parte da massa e energia do universo. A sua área de estudo também inclui relacionar partículas elementares ao universo primitivo, relatividade geral e astrofísica de neutrinos.</p>

<p>E nesta semana que passou tivemos o primeiro eclipse lunar acompanhado de uma Super Lua. Uma Super Lua ocorre quando uma lua cheia ou nova coincide com a passagem mais próxima da Lua com a Terra. A órbita da Lua em torno da Terra não é perfeitamente circular. Isto significa que a distância da Lua com da Terra varia conforme ela gira ao redor do planeta. O ponto mais próximo na órbita, chamado perigeu, está aproximadamente 43.000 km mais perto da Terra do que o ponto mais distante da órbita. Uma lua cheia que acontece perto do perigeu é chamada de Super Lua. O Eclipse Lunar não foi possível observar a partir de Portugal.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou a Ingenuity fez o seu sexto voo. Estava planeada a obtenção de imagens aéreas, estéreo de uma região de interesse a oeste. A telemetria do voo seis mostra que a primeira parte de 150 metros do voo correu sem problemas. Mas no final desta parte, algo aconteceu: a Ingenuity começou a ajustar a sua velocidade e a inclinar-se para frente e para trás num padrão oscilante. Este comportamento persistiu durante o resto do voo. Antes de pousar com segurança, os sensores a bordo indicaram que a aeronave de asas rotativas encontrou excursões de rotação e inclinação de mais de 20 graus, grandes entradas de controle e picos no consumo de energia. Olhando para o panorama geral, o voo terminou com a Ingenuity com segurança no solo porque vários subsistemas - o sistema de rotor, os actuadores e o sistema de energia - responderam às exigências crescentes para manter o helicóptero a voar.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker assim como alguns videos interessantes. É apresentada a revista MagPI Nº106 de Junho.</p>

<p><em>"The first lunar eclipse of 2021 is going to happen during the early hours of May 26. But this is going to be an especially super lunar event, as it will be a supermoon, a lunar eclipse, and a red blood moon all at once. So what does this all mean? What’s a super moon? A supermoon occurs when a full or new moon coincides with the Moon’s closest approach to the Earth.

<p><em>"On the 91st Martian day, or sol, of NASA’s Mars 2020 Perseverance rover mission, the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter performed its sixth flight. The flight was designed to expand the flight envelope and demonstrate aerial-imaging capabilities by taking stereo images of a region of interest to the west. Ingenuity was commanded to climb to an altitude of 33 feet (10 meters) before translating 492 feet (150 meters) to the southwest at a ground speed of 9 mph (4 meters per second). At that point, it was to translate 49 feet (15 meters) to the south while taking images toward the west, then fly another 164 feet (50 meters) northeast and land. Telemetry from Flight Six shows that the first 150-meter leg of the flight went off without a hitch. But toward the end of that leg, something happened: Ingenuity began adjusting its velocity and tilting back and forth in an oscillating pattern."</em> <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/status/305/surviving-an-in-flight-anomaly-what-happened-on-ingenuitys-sixth-flight/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Today we’re announcing the next generation of our Power over Ethernet (PoE) HAT. Compared to its predecessor, the Raspberry Pi PoE+ HAT delivers more power, implementing the 802.3at PoE+ standard; and it runs cooler, thanks to various design improvements. Best of all, we’ve been able to keep the original affordable price of $20. The current global semiconductor shortage — which you’ll almost certainly have read about by now — is constraining our supply of the original PoE HAT. In general, we’re weathering the shortage very well, and the supply of mainline Raspberry Pi computers, Zeros and our other products have not been affected (we’re very good at pipelining). Unfortunately, the first-gen PoE HAT uses silicon that’s in short supply."</em> <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/announcing-the-raspberry-pi-poe-hat/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Toshiba Electronic Devices &amp; Storage Corporation ("Toshiba") has launched “TLP3910,” a photovoltaic-output photocoupler (“photovoltaic coupler”) housed in a thin SO6L package, suitable for driving the gates of high-voltage power MOSFETs used as isolated solid state relay (SSR)　function. Volume production shipments start today. An SSR is a kind of semiconductor relays that has a photo triac, a photo transistor or photo thyristor as its output device. It is suitable for applications for performing ON/OFF control of large currents. A photovoltaic coupler is a photorelay with its optical devices but without the MOSFET used to perform switching functions. In configuring an isolated SSR, high-voltage, large-current switching, which photorelays handle with difficulty, can be implemented easily by combining a photovoltaic coupler and a MOSFET."</em> <a href="https://toshiba.semicon-storage.com/ap-en/company/news/news-topics/2021/05/opto-20210527-1.html">[...]</a>

The USB Type-C specification has also been updated with Release 2.1 to define 240W cable requirements, and with the updated USB PD protocol and power supply definition, this extends the applicability of USB PD to a large number of applications where 100W wasn’t adequate. The new USB PD architecture defines a much more stringent power negotiation protocol that helps to ensure that access to and use of this higher power capability can be done safely. It should be noted that safety requirements for products that use power in the range of 100 – 240W are also more stringent than lower power products and are defined by the applicable safety specifications dictated by the regulations for each country where the products will be sold. “With the new capabilities of USB Power Delivery 3.1, we now enable higher power products such as larger notebook PCs to shift from traditional power connectors to USB Type-C,” said Brad Saunders, USB Promoter Group Chairman."</em> <a href="https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/2021-05/USB%20PG%20USB%20PD%203.1%20DevUpdate%20Announcement_FINAL.pdf">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Path-breaking work that translates an amputee’s thoughts into finger motions, and even commands in video games, holds open the possibility of humans controlling just about anything digital with their minds. Using GPUs, a group of researchers trained an AI neural decoder able to run on a compact, power-efficient NVIDIA Jetson Nano system on module (SOM) to translate 46-year-old Shawn Findley’s thoughts into individual finger motions. And if that breakthrough weren’t enough, the team then plugged Findley into a PC running Far Cry 5 and Raiden IV, where he had his game avatar move, jump — even fly a virtual helicopter — using his mind. It’s a demonstration that not only promises to give amputees more natural and responsive control over their prosthetics. It could one day give users almost superhuman capabilities. The effort is detailed in a draft paper, or pre-print, titled “A Portable, Self-Contained Neuroprosthetic Hand with Deep Learning-Based Finger Control.” It details an extraordinary cross-disciplinary collaboration behind a system that, in effect, allows humans to control just about anything digital with thoughts."</em> <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/05/24/deep-learning-amputee-prosthetic-hand-video-games/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The LM301B EVO enables luminaires to meet latest DLC V5.1 Premium and EU’s ErP Ecodesign requirements to accommodate evolving needs of the lighting industry Samsung Electronics, a world leader in advanced digital component solutions, today introduced the LM301B EVO, a new mid-power LED package that has been designed to set the pace in light efficacy and color quality for indoor and industrial applications. Global regulations and standards for lighting, once centered on light efficacy, are becoming more comprehensive to include strict criteria for energy efficiency and color quality. The European Union’s energy labels for light sources (Energy-related Products Directive; ErP) have been revised to become more stringent, and the Design Lights Consortium (DLC) — a non-profit organization for lighting standards in the U.S. and Canada — has added an index for color quality while requiring the same high efficacy level. The LM301B EVO helps to meet the rigorous lighting standards on both energy efficiency and color quality. Built upon Samsung’s proprietary flip-chip design, the LED package features the industry’s highest efficacy of 235 lumens per watt (lm/W), by applying a new reflective material inside the packaging mold and improving phosphor conversion efficiency. Samsung also fine-tuned the red spectrum in the LED’s phosphor mix to enable superior color quality, especially with the red hues which are usually more difficult to render accurately."</em> <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsungs-new-mid-power-led-integrates-unsurpassed-light-efficacy-with-outstanding-color-quality">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Realizing the potential of self-driving cars hinges on technology that can quickly sense and react to obstacles and other vehicles in real time. Engineers from The University of Texas at Austin and the University of Virginia created a new first-of-its-kind light detecting device that can more accurately amplify weak signals bouncing off of faraway objects than current technology allows, giving autonomous vehicles a fuller picture of what’s happening on the road. The new device is more sensitive than other light detectors in that it also eliminates inconsistency, or noise, associated with the detection process. Such noise can cause systems to miss signals and put autonomous vehicle passengers at risk. "Autonomous vehicles send out laser signals that bounce off objects to tell you how far away you are. Not much light comes back, so if your detector is putting out more noise than the signal coming in you get nothing," said Joe Campbell, professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Virginia School of Engineering."</em> <a href="https://www.engr.utexas.edu/news/archive/9238-ultra-sensitive-light-detector-gives-self-driving-tech-a-jolt">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The MESO-BRAIN project used human-induced pluripotent stem cells placed on nanoscale 3D-laser-printed structures to replicate the brain’s neural networks 3D printing, also called additive manufacturing, has become widespread in recent years. By building successive layers of raw material such as metals, plastics, and ceramics, it has the key advantage of being able to produce very complex shapes or geometries that would be nearly impossible to construct through more traditional methods such as carving, grinding, or moulding. The technology offers huge potential in the health care sector. For example, doctors can use it to make products to match a patient’s anatomy: a radiologist could create an exact replica of a patient’s spine to help plan surgery; a dentist could scan a patient’s broken tooth to make a perfectly fitting crown reproduction. But what if we took a step further and apply 3D printing techniques to neuroscience? Stems cells are essentially the body’s raw materials; they are pluripotent elements from which all other cells with specialised functions are generated."</em> <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/article/id/430136-3d-printing-stem-cells-to-transform-neuroscience">[...]</a>

Now, researchers from Tokyo University of Science have adopted a new design method that optimizes both fiber thickness and orientation, achieving weight reduction in reinforced plastic and opening doors to lighter aircrafts and automobiles. Carbon is vital to the existence of all living organisms, since it forms the basis of all organic molecules that, in turn, form the basis of all living beings. While that alone is pretty impressive, it has recently found surprisingly novel applications in disciplines such as aerospace and civil engineering with the development of carbon fibers that are stronger, stiffer, and lighter than steel.

In a breakthrough that will contribute to this, published in Nature Communications, researchers from the RIKEN Cluster for Pioneering Research and RIKEN Center for Advanced Photonics, along with collaborators, have developed a way to use a “dry transfer technique”—a technique that uses no solvent—to position optical quality carbon nanotubes in a precise way. Carbon nanotubes are a promising type of materials with potential uses in applications such as light-emitting diodes, single-electron transistors, or as single photon sources. They are essentially tubes made up of graphene twisted in specific ways, and the way they are twisted is critical for allowing the desired properties to emerge. Creating devices with desired properties requires precise manipulation of the position and orientation of the nanotubes, along with a property known as “chirality,” which essentially describes how much it is twisted. It is difficult to manipulate the molecules precisely, however, as using solvents or high-temperature treatment inevitably leaves the nanotubes dirty, hampering their optical characteristics."</em> <a href="https://www.riken.jp/en/news_pubs/research_news/pr/2021/20210525_6/index.html">[...]</a>

Perovskites have drawn attention over the past decade because of their ability to act as semiconductors even when there are defects in the material’s crystal structure. This makes perovskites special because getting most other semiconductors to work well requires stringent and costly manufacturing techniques to produce crystals that are as defect-free as possible. In what amounts to the discovery of a new state of matter, the McGill team has made a step forward in unlocking the mystery of how perovskites pull off this trick. “Historically, people have been using bulk semiconductors that are perfect crystals. And now, all of a sudden, this imperfect, soft crystal starts to work for semiconductor applications, from photovoltaics to LEDs,” explains senior author Patanjali Kambhampati, an associate professor in the Department of Chemistry at McGill."</em> <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/channels/news/study-promising-photovoltaic-material-leads-discovery-new-state-matter-331213">[...]</a>

Nitrogen, an element that is essential for all living cells, makes up about 78 percent of Earth’s atmosphere. However, most organisms cannot make use of this nitrogen until it is converted into ammonia. Until humans invented industrial processes for ammonia synthesis, almost all ammonia on the planet was generated by microbes using nitrogenases, the only enzymes that can break the nitrogen-nitrogen bond found in gaseous dinitrogen, or N2. These enzymes contain clusters of metal and sulfur atoms that help perform this critical reaction, but the mechanism of how they do so is not well-understood. For the first time, MIT chemists have now determined the structure of a complex that forms when N2 binds to these clusters, and they discovered that the clusters are able to weaken the nitrogen-nitrogen bond to a surprising extent."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/metals-nitrogen-nitrogen-bonds-0527">[...]</a>

So, as a research paper published today by the journal Science reports, these linear defects, or dislocations, “are usually avoided at all costs.” But sometimes, a team of researchers from Europe, Iowa State University and the U.S. Department of Energy’s Ames Laboratory report in that paper, engineering those defects in some oxide crystals can actually increase electrical performance. The research team – led by Jürgen Rödel and Jurij Koruza of the Technical University of Darmstadt in Germany – found certain defects produce significant improvements in two key measurements of electrical performance in barium titanate, a crystalline ceramic material. “By introducing these defects into the material, we can change, modify or improve the material’s functional properties,” said Xiaoli Tan, an Iowa State professor of materials science and engineering and a longtime research collaborator with Rödel. In this case, the engineered defects led to a five-fold increase in dielectric properties (that restrict the flow of current) and a 19-fold increase in piezoelectric properties (that internally generates an electric field when subject to mechanical stress), Tan said."</em> <a href="https://www.news.iastate.edu/news/2021/05/27/defects">[...]</a>

<p><em>"It is a glove that can be used by those who cannot speak to communicate with others in verbal language. The Problem Many people across the world cannot speak and they often use body language and sign language to communicate with others but not everyone knows sign language so the mute cannot communicate with everyone using only sign language. The Solution This glove can be worn by people who cannot speak and it can help them to communicate by translating their gestures from sign language to verbal language and then pronouncing them with help of a mobile application. It's Working It works by recognizing the gestures made by hand with help of flex sensors placed on fingers, flex sensor varies its resistance based on how much a finger is bent and that resistance is sensed by the Arduino and based on the amount of resistance of each sensor, it prints the letter of the gesture on serial monitor. The mobile application reads the serial monitor, prints it on screen and pronounces it. "</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/rushilsaraswat/sign-glove-add90e">[...]</a>

Enter the NeoPill, an easy to make NeoPixel emulator that taps off of your target microcontroller to graphically emulate NeoPixels on your PC. Consider it a NeoPixel to USB bridge. This project started as an investigation into STM CubeMX operation – I’d be lying if I said configuring the powerful STM32 timers were easy – and after looking at examples online, reading (and re-reading) manuals, and spending time with the debugger I got something working ok. All you need is: - A STM32 Blue Pill. - A few jumpers. - USB cable."</em> <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/179916-neopill">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Create a rotating lithophane lamp that when triggered will play music and LED animations Introduction A lithophane is a translucent, etched object that once back lit will display an image. With 3d printers readily available it is easy to create a lithophane in a variety of shapes and sizes. This project was intended to create a lithophane lamp, but rather then just be static I wanted the lamp to rotate creating a 360 degree lithophane "lamp shade" allowing all sides to be visible without the viewers having to move themselves. After the initial design I decided it would be interesting to add a giant button, that when pressed would start a music and light show for everyone. The project consists of 5 major components: The cylinder lithophane The electronics to run the lamp Gears and housing so the lithophane is spinning at a slow enough rate Enclosure to hold all the components The code making everything work Lithophane The lithophane we will be generating will be 152mm tall and require a circumference of 375mm, resulting in a diameter of 119mm. This information is important to ensure the image the lithophane is created from has the right length to width size ratio."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/markkomus/musical-lithophane-lamp-336fd3">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Use the Arduino Due to control a large LED flat panel display. And the software to create and solve mazes on it Two years ago, I published a tutorial about building a 128 x 64 LED two color panel and controlling it with an Arduino Mega. It's here: LED Flat Panel with Arduino MEGA. The most popular software I included with it was a sketch to create and solve mazes. In this tutorial, I will upgrade the system by changing the processor to an 84 MHz Arduino Due and also provide a lot of new information about the software required to build and solve mazes! So this tutorial is divided into two parts - first a detailed discussion about how we create and solve mazes in software, and then in part II, I will discuss the construction and software to control the large LED panel using the Arduino Due."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/doug-domke/creating-and-solving-mazes-on-a-128-x-64-led-panel-bb7740">[...]</a>

I'm hoping a good portion of you saw the recent Explaining Computers video comparing various Raspberry Pi models and how long they last on a 12V lead acid battery versus a USB battery pack. If not, it's worth a watch! This inspired me to think more about how useful a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B could really be in a remote, battery-powered setting. I mean it's tempting, right?
