<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1784, o astrónomo alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Bessel">Friedrich Bessel</a>. Ele passou toda a sua carreira desde os 26 anos de idade (nomeado 1809) como director de Frederick William III do novo Observatório Königsberg da Prússia e professor de astronomia. A sua tarefa monumental era determinar as posições e os movimentos adequados para cerca de 50.000 estrelas, o que permitiu a primeira determinação precisa das distâncias interestelares. O trabalho de Bessel na determinação das constantes de pré-cessão, nutação e aberração ganhou-lhe mais honras. Para além do sol, foi o primeiro a medir a distância de uma estrela, por paralaxe, de 61 Cygni (1838). Na análise matemática, ele é conhecido pela sua função de Bessel.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1887, o físico quântico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Ludwig_Hertz">Gustav Ludwig Hertz</a>. Ele, com James Franck, recebeu o Prémio Nobel da Física em 1925 pela experiência Franck-Hertz, que confirmou a teoria quântica de que a energia só pode ser absorvida por um átomo em quantidades definidas e forneceu uma importante confirmação do modelo atómico de Bohr. Era um sobrinho de Heinrich Hertz.</p>

<p>Em 1894 era realizada a primeira corrida de carros entre cidades, entre Paris e Rouen em França. É considerada a primeira corrida automóvel competitiva.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou, a Blue Origin completou com sucesso o primeiro voo humano da New Shepard com quatro cidadãos a bordo. A tripulação incluía Jeff Bezos, Mark Bezos, Wally Funk e Oliver Daemen, que se tornaram todos oficialmente astronautas quando passaram a Linha Kármán, a fronteira do espaço reconhecida internacionalmente. Wally Funk, 82 anos, tornou-se a pessoa mais velha a voar no espaço. Oliver Daemen, 18 anos, foi o primeiro astronauta comercial de sempre a comprar um bilhete e a voar para o espaço num veículo espacial privado e licenciado a partir de um local de lançamento privado. Tornou-se também a pessoa mais jovem a voar no espaço.
O New Shepard tornou-se o primeiro veículo comercial sob uma licença de veículo de lançamento reutilizável suborbital a voar clientes pagantes, tanto de carga útil como de astronauta, para o espaço e de volta.
Jeff e Mark Bezos tornaram-se os primeiros irmãos a voar juntos no espaço.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202107/1229097.shtml">World's speediest 600 km/h maglev rolls off assembly line in E.China’s Qingdao</a></h2>

<p><em>"China's self-developed and the world's fastest maglev transportation system with a speed of 600 kilometers per hour rolled off the assembly line on Tuesday in Qingdao, East China's Shandong Province, marking another crucial milestone in the country's rapid rise as a global leader in high-speed rail technology and manufacturing and in its broad, ambitious goals to accelerate urbanization and build a modern socialist power. The maglev train can fill the gap between the current high-speed train that runs at around 350 km/h and airplanes with a speed of 800 km/h, which will support China's comprehensive transportation network planned by 2035, analysts noted. The maglev train is currently the fastest available ground vehicle. It is the fastest method of surface transportation within the range of 1,500 kilometers, according to a report by the CRRC sent to the Global Times on Tuesday. What is currently a 10-hour high-speed train trip from South China's Shenzhen to Shanghai will be shortened to only 2.5 hours once a maglev train is built. The new maglev train showcases a number of technological breakthroughs and advances, including a self-developed brake system that is 30 percent more efficient than the Shanghai maglev train, which means that the braking distance is reduced from about 16 kilometers to 10 kilometers, CRRC Qingdao Sifang Rolling Stock Research Institute (CRRC SRI) told the Global Times on Tuesday."</em> <a href="https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202107/1229097.shtml">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://newatlas.com/telecommunications/data-transmission-speed-record-319-terabits-second/">Data transmission speed record clocks blistering 319 Terabits per second</a></h2>

<p><em>"The world record for fastest internet speed has been utterly shattered as Japanese engineers have demonstrated a data transmission rate of 319 Terabits per second (Tb/s) through optical fibers. The record was set over more than 3,000 km (1,864 miles) of fibers, and is apparently compatible with existing cable infrastructure. It’s hard to overstate just how incredibly fast that transmission speed is. It’s almost twice the previous record of 178 Tb/s, set less than a year ago, and seven times faster than the record before that – 44.2 Tb/s from an experimental photonic chip. NASA gets by with “only” 400 Gb/s, and it absolutely demolishes speeds currently available to consumers: the fastest home internet connections top out at 10 Gb/s in parts of Japan, New Zealand and the US. The breakthrough was achieved using existing fiber optic infrastructure, with more advanced technologies added on."</em> <a href="https://newatlas.com/telecommunications/data-transmission-speed-record-319-terabits-second/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2283945-google-demonstrates-vital-step-towards-large-scale-quantum-computers/">Google demonstrates vital step towards large-scale quantum computers</a></h2>

<p><em>"Google has shown that its Sycamore quantum computer can detect and fix computational errors, an essential step for large-scale quantum computing, but its current system generates more errors than it solves. Error-correction is a standard feature for ordinary, or classical, computers, which store data using bits with two possible states: 0 and 1. Transmitting data with extra “parity bits” that warn if a 0 has flipped to 1, or vice versa, means such errors can be found and fixed. In quantum computing the problem is far more complex as each quantum bit, or qubit, exists in a mixed state of 0 and 1, and any attempt to measure them directly destroys the data. One longstanding theoretical solution to this has been to cluster many physical qubits into a single “logical qubit”. Although such logical qubits have been created previously, they hadn’t been used for error correction until now."</em> <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2283945-google-demonstrates-vital-step-towards-large-scale-quantum-computers/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The world’s first 3D-printed steel footbridge has been unveiled in Amsterdam - and it's packed with cutting-edge sensors that measure in real-time how it handles pedestrian traffic. It was installed over one of the oldest canals in the city's Red Light District and inaugurated by Dutch Queen Maxima on Thursday. Designed by Dutch designer Joris Laarman, the 12-metre futuristic structure was created with a type of 3D printing technique using welding robots. MX3D, the company that developed the technology, said the elaborate design of the bridge showcases the possibilities of robotic 3D printing in architecture. "If you want to have a really highly decorated bridge or a really aesthetic bridge, suddenly it becomes a good option to print it, because it's not just about making things cheaper and more efficient," said Tim Geurtjens, who developed the MX3D technology. Smart design The bridge doesn't simply look eye-catching, it's also built to be smart."</em> <a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2021/07/16/the-world-s-first-3d-printed-steel-bridge-has-opened-in-amsterdam">[...]</a>

In a study appearing today in Nature, the researchers report that the material exhibits superconductivity at surprisingly high magnetic fields of up to 10 Tesla, which is three times higher than what the material is predicted to endure if it were a conventional superconductor. The results strongly imply that magic-angle trilayer graphene, which was initially discovered by the same group, is a very rare type of superconductor, known as a “spin-triplet,” that is impervious to high magnetic fields.

The prototype device, known as MAPrad, is just one tenth the size of existing ground penetrating radar systems, yet can see almost twice as deeply below ground – more than 100 metres down – to identify minerals, ice deposits, or voids such as lava tubes. Local start-up CD3D PTY Limited has now received a grant from the Australian Space Agency’s Moon to Mars initiative to further develop the prototype with RMIT University, including testing it by mapping one of Earth’s largest accessible systems of lava tubes.

This water solubility and solubility in other solvents is actually a great advantage, as it makes building perovskite solar panels simpler and inexpensive – another perk along with their performance.

<p><em>"A new wearable device turns the touch of a finger into a source of power for small electronics and sensors. Engineers at the University of California San Diego developed a thin, flexible strip that can be worn on a fingertip and generate small amounts of electricity when a person’s finger sweats or presses on it. What’s special about this sweat-fueled device is that it generates power even while the wearer is asleep or sitting still. This is potentially a big deal for the field of wearables because researchers have now figured out how to harness the energy that can be extracted from human sweat even when a person is not moving. This type of device is the first of its kind, said co-first author Lu Yin, a nanoengineering Ph.D. student at the UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering. “Unlike other sweat-powered wearables, this one requires no exercise, no physical input from the wearer in order to be useful."</em> <a href="https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/news/release/3304">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A team led by HZB physicist Dr. Jaime Sánchez-Barriga has gained new insights into the ultrafast response of topological states of matter to femtosecond laser excitation. Using time- and spin-resolved methods at BESSY II, the physicists explored how, after optical excitation, the complex interplay in the behavior of excited electrons in the bulk and on the surface results in unusual spin dynamics. The work is an important step on the way to spintronic devices based on topological materials for ultrafast information processing. The laws of quantum physics rule the microcosm. They determine, for example, how easily electrons move through a crystal and thus whether the material is a metal, a semiconductor or an insulator. Quantum physics may lead to exotic properties in certain materials: In so-called topological insulators, only the electrons that can occupy some specific quantum states are free to move like massless particles on the surface, while this mobility is completely absent for electrons in the bulk."</em> <a href="https://www.helmholtz-berlin.de/pubbin/news_seite?nid=23062;sprache=en;seitenid=1">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A team of researchers from the University of Maryland has 3D printed a soft robotic hand that is agile enough to play Nintendo’s Super Mario Bros.—and win! The feat, highlighted on the front cover of the latest issue of Science Advances, demonstrates a promising innovation in the field of “soft robotics”, which centers on creating new types of flexible, inflatable robots that are powered using water or air rather than electricity. Soft robots’ inherent safety and adaptability has sparked interest in their use for applications like prosthetics and biomedical devices. Unfortunately, controlling the fluids that make these soft robots bend and move has been especially difficult—until now. The key breakthrough by the team, led by University of Maryland assistant professor of mechanical engineering Ryan D. Sochol, was the ability to 3D print fully assembled soft robots with “integrated fluidic circuits” in a single step. “Previously, each finger of a soft robotic hand would typically need its own control line, which can limit portability and usefulness,” explains co-first author Joshua Hubbard, who performed the research during his time as an undergraduate researcher in Sochol’s Bioinspired Advanced Manufacturing (BAM) Laboratory at UMD."</em> <a href="https://eng.umd.edu/news/story/university-of-maryland-engineers-have-3d-printed-a-soft-robotic-hand-that-can-play-nintendo">[...]</a>

Mars has been assumed to have a similar structure. “Now seismic data has confirmed our view that Mars is a differentiated planet that presumably was once completely molten before differentiating into crust, mantle and core – that are compositionally distinct like in the Earth,” says Amir Khan, a scientist at the Institute of Geophysics at ETH Zurich and at the Physics Institute at the University of Zurich.

At low temperatures, certain materials lose their electrical resistance and conduct electricity without any loss - this phenomenon of superconductivity has been known since 1911, but it is still not fully understood. And that is a pity, because finding a material that would still have superconducting properties even at high temperatures would probably trigger a technological revolution. A discovery made at TU Wien (Vienna) could be an important step in this direction: A team of solid-state physicists studied an unusual material - a so-called "strange metal" made of ytterbium, rhodium and silicon.

<p><em>"The breakthrough could have wide-reaching implications in quantum information, cryptography and energy harvesting, according to a new study A team of scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory propose that modulated quantum metasurfaces can control all properties of photonic qubits, a breakthrough that could impact the fields of quantum information, communications, sensing and imaging, as well as energy and momentum harvesting. The results of their study were released yesterday in the journal Physical Review Letters, published by the American Physical Society. “People have studied classical metasurfaces for a long time,” says Diego Dalvit, who works in the Condensed Matter and Complex Systems group at the Laboratory’s Theoretical Division. “But we came up with this new idea, which was to modulate in time and space the optical properties of a quantum metasurface that allow us to manipulate, on-demand, all degrees of freedom of a single photon, which is the most elementary unit of light.” Metasurfaces are ultrathin structures that can manipulate light in ways not usually seen in nature. In this case, the team developed a metasurface that looked like an array of rotated crosses, which they can then manipulate with lasers or electrical pulses. They then proposed to shoot a single photon through the metasurface, where the photon splits into a superposition of many colors, paths, and spinning states that are all intertwined, generating so-called quantum entanglement—meaning the single photon is capable of inheriting all these different properties at once."</em> <a href="https://discover.lanl.gov/news/releases/0721-new-quantum-research">[...]</a>

<p><em>"From the previous projects on this page, you can probably see that I have a deep interest in robotic projects. In one of my previous Instructables, I built a quadruped robot using large heavy-duty servo motors, and this time I decided to try and make a micro version of the quadruped robot that is significantly more versatile and nimble. In this Instructable, I will show you the design and assembly of the robotic micro quadruped. The primary goal while building this project was to make the system as small as possible while being robust so that while experimenting with various walking and running gaits I wouldn't have to constantly worry about the hardware failing. This allowed me to push the hardware to its limit and experiment with complex gaits and motions. A secondary goal was to make the quadruped relatively low-cost using readily available hobby parts and 3D printing which allowed for rapid prototyping."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Powered-Micro-Quadruped/">[...]</a>

The Theremin is an electronic musical instrument controlled without physical contact by the thereminist (performer). It is named after its inventor, Leon Theremin, who patented the device in 1928. This time I will show you how to make such an instrument that produces tones or sounds based on the light that falls on the surface of the Photoresistor. By moving your hand over the photoresistor, the intensity of light falling on it, changes, and that change the pitch.

Overview Snoring is estimated to affect 57% of men and 40% of women in the United States. It even occurs in up to 27% of children. These statistics demonstrate snoring is widespread, but its severity and health implications can vary. Snoring can be light, occasional, and unconcerning, or it may be the sign of a serious underlying sleep-related breathing disorder. Snoring is caused by the rattling and vibration of tissues near the airway in the back of the throat."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/naveenbskumar/snoring-guardian-dccc34">[...]</a>

The MLWB commands are largely independent of each other and may be used for playing just music, illuminating just lights, or a combination of both. The MLWB does not require the use of any other programming functions, techniques or logic, just the simple statement of its commands.
