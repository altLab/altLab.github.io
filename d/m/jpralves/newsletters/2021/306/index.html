<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1811, o astrónomo francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbain_Le_Verrier">Urbain Le Verrier</a>. Ele previu por meios matemáticos a existência do planeta Neptuno. Independentemente de Adams, Le Verrier calculou a posição de Neptuno a partir de irregularidades na órbita de Úrano. Como disse Camille Flammarion, ele descobriu um planeta com a ponta de sua caneta, sem nenhum instrumento além da força dos seus cálculos. Em 1856, o astrónomo alemão Johan G. Galle descobriu Netuno depois de apenas uma hora de busca, a um grau da posição que tinha sido calculada por Le Verrier, que lhe pediu para procurá-lo ali. Deste modo, Le Verrier deu a confirmação mais notável da teoria da gravitação proposta por Newton.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1822, o quimico e geologista francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_%C3%89tienne_Sainte-Claire_Deville">Henri Étienne Sainte-Claire Deville</a>. Foi ele que iniciou a primeira produção industrial de alumínio. A sua carreira começou com pesquisas de terebintina. Em 1849, ao voltar-se para a química inorgânica, ele sintetizou o pentóxido de nitrogénio. Friedrich Woehler isolou o alumínio usando potássio caro, como uma curiosidade de laboratório. Em 1854, Deville fez alumínio, a partir de cloreto de alumínio e sódio menos caro. Em 1860, ele estava a produzir alumínio numa fábrica em Javel, Paris, e mais tarde em Nanterre. O metal era mais caro que o ouro até Charles Hall inventar o processo electrolítico barato. Deville também estudou a platina e outros minerais. Como geólogo, ele visitou os locais costeiros do Vesúvio e Stromboli. Ele propôs que as erupções vulcânicas ocorriam quando a água do mar entrava nas fissuras da crosta terrestre, onde o contacto com as rochas quentes produzia as erupções explosivas.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1822, o matemático e educador francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Bertrand">Joseph Bertrand</a>. Ele é lembrado pelas suas aplicações elegantes de equações diferenciais à mecânica analítica, particularmente em termodinâmica, e pelo seu trabalho sobre probabilidade estatística e a teoria das curvas e superfícies. Em 1845, Bertrand conjecturou que existe pelo menos um primo entre n e (2n-2) para cada n>3, como provado cinco anos depois por Chebyshev. Em 1855, ele traduziu para o francês o trabalho de Gauss sobre a teoria dos erros e o método dos mínimos quadrados. Ele escreveu uma série de notas sobre a redução dos dados das observações.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1915, o cientista da computação norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._C._R._Licklider">J.C.R. Licklider</a>. Ele criou a ideia de uma rede universal de computadores para transferir e recuperar facilmente informações que os seus sucessores desenvolveram e criaram a Internet. Em 1959, no seu primeiro livro, Libraries of the Future, Licklider expandiu a ideia de Vannevar Bush de um sistema automatizado de biblioteca para descrever como os computadores poderiam distribuir recursos de biblioteca de uma única base de dados para vários utilizadores remotos. Em 1962, quando era director do Escritório de Técnicas de Processamento de Informações da Agência de Projectos de Pesquisa Avançada do Departamento de Defesa dos EUA (DARPA), ele enviou um memorando a colegas prevendo uma rede de computadores de time-sharing. Posteriormente foi construída a ARPANET, que se tornou o modelo para a Internet. Ele também foi um visionário da interacção humano-computador, lembrado por seu artigo de 1960, 'Man-Computer Symbiosis.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1920, o físico holandês-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaas_Bloembergen">Nicolaas Bloembergen</a>. Ele partilhou (com Arthur L. Schawlow dos Estados Unidos e Kai M. Siegbahn da Suécia) o Prémio Nobel de Física de 1981 pelos seus estudos espectroscópicos revolucionários da interacção da radiação electromagnética com a matéria. Bloembergen fez um uso pioneiro de lasers nessas investigações e desenvolveu bombas de três níveis usadas em masers e lasers.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou o rover Perseverance que se encontra numa missão em Marte, realizou a sua primeira viagem em Marte, cobrindo 6,5 metros em toda a paisagem marciana. Esta viagem serviu como um teste de mobilidade que marca apenas um dos muitos marcos à medida que os membros da equipa verificam e calibram cada sistema, subsistema e instrumentos no Perseverance. Assim que o rover começar a seguir os seus objectivos científicos, são esperados deslocações regulares de 200 metros ou mais.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker assim como alguns videos interessantes. É apresentada a revista newelectronics de 9 de Março e o livro "An Introduction to Ray Tracing".</p>

<p><em>"The first trek of the agency’s largest, most advanced rover yet on the Red Planet marks a major milestone before science operations get under way. NASA’s Mars 2020 Perseverance rover performed its first drive on Mars March 4, covering 21.3 feet (6.5 meters) across the Martian landscape. The drive served as a mobility test that marks just one of many milestones as team members check out and calibrate every system, subsystem, and instrument on Perseverance. Once the rover begins pursuing its science goals, regular commutes extending 656 feet (200 meters) or more are expected. “When it comes to wheeled vehicles on other planets, there are few first-time events that measure up in significance to that of the first drive,” said Anais Zarifian, Mars 2020 Perseverance rover mobility test bed engineer at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. “This was our first chance to ‘kick the tires’ and take Perseverance out for a spin."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-perseverance-drives-on-mars-terrain-for-first-time">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://toshiba.semicon-storage.com/ap-en/company/news/news-topics/2021/03/mosfet-20210311-1.html">Toshiba Releases 650V Super Junction Power MOSFETs in TOLL Package that Help Improve Efficiency of High Current Equipment</a></h2>

<p><em>"Toshiba Electronic Devices &amp; Storage Corporation ("Toshiba") has launched 650V super junction power MOSFETs, TK065U65Z, TK090U65Z, TK110U65Z, TK155U65Z and TK190U65Z, in its DTMOSVI series that are housed in a TOLL (TO-leadless) package. Volume production shipments start today. TOLL is a surface-mount package that has an approximately 27% smaller footprint than the usual D2PAK package. It is also a 4-pin type package that allows Kelvin connection of its signal source terminal for the gate drive. This can reduce the influence by the inductance of the source wire in the package to bring out the high-speed switching performance of the MOSFETs, suppressing oscillation when switching. Compared to Toshiba’s current product, TK090N65Z, the turn-on switching loss is reduced by about 68% and turn-off switching loss by about 56%."</em> <a href="https://toshiba.semicon-storage.com/ap-en/company/news/news-topics/2021/03/mosfet-20210311-1.html">[...]</a>

How this company was reborn just weeks ago, exiting the state of bankruptcy, is surprising, but not at all irrational: in its official statement, (the new) MIPS has become a member of RISC-V International, the non-profit organization managing the fully open-hardware ISA, substantially replacing their current architecture with the de facto open chip standard in its entirety. Licensing of the original MIPS architecture to third parties will probably be managed as before, so that the "old" architecture will remain available upon need.

<h2><a href="https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/295179830">Cheap, nontoxic carbon nanodots poised to be quantum dots of the future</a></h2>

<p><em>"Tiny fluorescent semiconductor dots, called quantum dots, are useful in a variety of health and electronic technologies but are made of toxic, expensive metals. Nontoxic and economic carbon-based dots are easy to produce, but they emit less light. A new study that uses ultrafast nanometric imaging found good and bad emitters among populations of carbon dots. This observation suggests that by selecting only super-emitters, carbon nanodots can be purified to replace toxic metal quantum dots in many applications, the researchers said. The findings, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, brought together researchers from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County in a collaborative project through the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at Illinois. “Coming into this study, we did not know if all carbon dots are only mediocre emitters or if some were perfect and others were bad,” said Illinois chemistry professor Martin Gruebele, who led the study."</em> <a href="https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/295179830">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The recent synthesis of one-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures, a type of heterostructure made by layering two-dimensional materials that are one atom thick, may lead to new, miniaturized electronics that are currently not possible, according to a team of Penn State and University of Tokyo researchers. Engineers commonly produce heterostructures to achieve new device properties that are not available in a single material. A van der Waals heterostructure is one made of 2D materials that are stacked directly on top of each other like Lego-blocks or a sandwich. The van der Waals force, which is an attractive force between uncharged molecules or atoms, holds the materials together. According to Slava V. Rotkin, Penn State Frontier Professor of Engineering Science and Mechanics, the one-dimensional van der Waals heterostructure produced by the researchers is different from the van der Waals heterostructures engineers have produced thus far. "It looks like a stack of 2D-layered materials that are rolled up in a perfect cylinder,” Rotkin said."</em> <a href="https://news.psu.edu/story/650252/2021/03/09/research/sushi-rolled-2d-heterostructures-may-lead-new-miniaturized">[...]</a>

This type of matter either cannot currently be found or cannot be manufactured in viable quantities. In contrast, new research carried out at the University of Göttingen gets around this problem by constructing a new class of hyper-fast ‘solitons’ using sources with only positive energies that can enable travel at any speed.

For decades, there has been a trend in microelectronics towards ever smaller and more compact transistors. 2D materials such as graphene are seen as a beacon of hope here: they are the thinnest material layers that can possibly exist, consisting of only one or a few atomic layers. Nevertheless, they can conduct electrical currents - conventional silicon technology, on the other hand, no longer works properly if the layers become too thin. However, such materials are not used in a vacuum; they have to be combined with suitable insulators – in order to seal them off from unwanted environmental influences, and also in order to control the flow of current via the so-called field effect."</em> <a href="https://www.tuwien.at/en/tu-wien/news/news-articles/news/mikrochips-der-zukunft-noch-fehlen-passende-isolatoren">[...]</a>

But the quest for better LEDs, offering both lower costs and brighter colours, has recently drawn scientists to a material called perovskite. A recent joint-research project co-led by the scientist from City University of Hong Kong (CityU) has now developed a 2D perovskite material for the most efficient LEDs. From household lighting to mobile phone displays, from pinpoint lighting needed for endoscopy procedures to light source to grow vegetables in Space, LEDs are everywhere. Yet current high-quality LEDs still need to be processed at high temperatures and using elaborated deposition technologies — which make their production cost expensive. Scientists have recently realised that metal halide perovskites – semiconductor materials with the same structure as calcium titanate mineral, but with another elemental composition – are extremely promising candidates for next-generation LEDs."</em> <a href="https://www.cityu.edu.hk/research/stories/2021/03/10/producing-highly-efficient-leds-based-2d-perovskite-films">[...]</a>

Stronger, lighter, and more flexible than graphene, borophene could potentially revolutionize batteries, electronics, sensors, photovoltaics, and quantum computing. Unfortunately, borophene only exists inside of an ultrahigh vacuum chamber, limiting its practical use outside the lab.

<p><em>"Study shows how century-old design principle can be a pathway to overcoming failure. Catastrophic collapse of materials and structures is the inevitable consequence of a chain reaction of locally confined damage – from solid ceramics that snap after the development of a small crack to metal space trusses that give way after the warping of a single strut. In a study published this week in Advanced Materials, engineers at the University of California, Irvine and the Georgia Institute of Technology describe the creation of a new class of mechanical metamaterials that delocalize deformations to prevent failure. They did so by turning to tensegrity, a century-old design principle in which isolated rigid bars are integrated into a flexible mesh of tethers to produce very lightweight, self-tensioning truss structures. Starting with 950 nanometer-diameter members, the team used a sophisticated direct laser writing technique to generate elementary cells sized between 10 and 20 microns. These were built up into eight-unit supercells that could be assembled with others to make a continuous structure."</em> <a href="https://news.uci.edu/2021/03/11/uci-led-team-creates-new-ultralightweight-crush-resistant-tensegrity-metamaterials/">[...]</a>

The source is a “radio-loud” quasar — a bright object with powerful jets emitting at radio wavelengths — that is so far away its light has taken 13 billion years to reach us. The discovery could provide important clues to help astronomers understand the early Universe. Quasars are very bright objects that lie at the centre of some galaxies and are powered by supermassive black holes. As the black hole consumes the surrounding gas, energy is released, allowing astronomers to spot them even when they are very far away. The newly discovered quasar, nicknamed P172+18, is so distant that light from it has travelled for about 13 billion years to reach us: we see it as it was when the Universe was just around 780 million years old."</em> <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso2103/">[...]</a>

Timing requirements are first determined in the implementation of a design in Vivado when the logic is being placed and routed in the fabric of the target FPGA chip (in this case it is the Zynq 7020 on the Arty Z7 development board that I'm using).

Anything with a modest amount of code memory, data memory, processor power and I/O (serial, SPI etc depending on choice of GPS and radio) will do.

On the other hand, if you fail, the difficulty decreases and the RGB displays the colour red. How It Works Each LED continuously switches between ON and OFF one at a time. A timer is added to delay this process and give the illusion of movement. When the blue LED is switched on and the button is clicked, we reduce the subsequent time for delays (This gives the illusion of the light moving faster) and the RGB LED displays the colour green."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/chukwunonso_j/arduino-arcade-style-led-game-34c313">[...]</a>

The data that is logged in the sd card is: correct, power, voltage, LM35 temperature and execution time. In order to not discharge the battery without having conected all the components, there is a button to start the discharge of the batery. Once the button is pressend, the relay closes, the battery starts to discharge and the data is logged eery 5 seconds on the sd card. When the battery is bellow 2.8V, the relay opens to prevent over discharging the 18650 battery and also appears a new display showing the principal data adquired by the ESP32.

<p><em>"Recently I realised that, as part of his 8086 reverse-engineering series, Ken Shirriff had posted online a high resolution photograph of the 8086 die with the metal layer removed. This was something I have been looking for for some time, in order to extract and disassemble the 8086 microcode. I had previously found very high resolution photos of the die with the metal layer intact, but only half of the bits of the microcode ROM were readable. Ken also posted a high resolution photograph of the microcode ROM of the 8088, which is very similar but not identical. I was very curious to know what the differences were. I used bitract to extract the bits from the two main microcode ROMs, and also from the translation ROM which maps opcode bit patterns onto positions within the main microcode ROM."</em> <a href="https://www.reenigne.org/blog/8086-microcode-disassembled/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Atari’s original PONG arcade game has an interesting design: No microprocessor or program; the whole game logic and signal generation are hard-wired from sixty-some TTL chips. So, when I got my hands on an original 1972 PONG circuit board, I wanted to build a playable cabinet around it, but also display the board with its surprisingly low-integration components. I decided to take my half-scale Asteroids idea a step further, and give center stage to the circuit board in a cabinet styled like a picture frame. The shallow depth of the frame (6 cm, a good 2") means that there is no room for a period-correct cathode ray tube; an 8" TFT is used instead. But I added a homebrew, FPGA-based video upscaler to simulate scan lines, horizontal blur and some phosphor afterglow, which makes the image look “right” to my eyes. While this project is complete and has turned out nicely, this web page is preliminary."</em> <a href="http://www.e-basteln.de/arcade/pong/pong/">[...]</a>
