<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1804, o engenheiro civil, inventor e teórico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squire_Whipple">Squire Whipple</a>. Ele forneceu as primeiras regras de base científica para a construção de pontes, foi considerado um dos melhores engenheiros do século XIX, e era conhecido como o "pai das pontes de ferro". Começou a sua carreira como construtor de pontes em 1840, desenhando e patenteando uma treliça de ponte de ferro. Durante os dez anos seguintes, construiu várias pontes no canal do Erie e nos caminhos-de-ferro de Nova Iorque e Erie. O seu desenho da ponte de chicote de treliça Whipple foi o modelo para centenas de pontes que atravessaram o Canal Erie no final do século XIX. Antes de desenvolver o seu desenho, Whipple trabalhou durante vários anos em levantamentos, estimativas e relatórios para a ampliação do Canal Erie, e em 1840 patenteou uma balança para pesagem de barcos do canal Erie. Mais tarde, construiu a primeira balança de pesagem construída no Canal Erie. A invenção da máquina a vapor exigiu pontes que pudessem suportar cargas vivas pesadas e isto motivou Squire a voltar a sua atenção para as pontes. Em 1853, completou uma ponte ferroviária de ferro de 146 pés de vão perto de West Troy (agora Watervliet), N.Y. O seu livro sobre o desenho de pontes utilizando métodos científicos (1847) foi o primeiro do seu género. As fórmulas e os seus métodos continuam a ser úteis.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1857, o engenheiro electrotécnico e inventor inglês Sydney Evershed. Ele co-fundou a firma de Evershed and Vignoles, Ltd., fabricantes de instrumentos eléctricos (reg. 5 Fev 1895). Em 1885, tornou-se gerente da pequena fábrica Goolden e Trotter, formada para fabricar o voltímetro Cardew. Adquiriu o negócio sucessor em 1895 com o seu assistente Ernest B. Vignoles. Os seus produtos tornaram-se internacionalmente conhecidos com a marca "Megger". Investigaram também os fenómenos magnéticos nos núcleos dos transformadores, ímanes permanentes, e a estrutura física dos não condutores. Ele concebeu um indicador de leme e importantes controlos de armas para a Marinha utilizados na I Guerra Mundial.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1877, o inventor e fabricante americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Schick">Jacob Schick</a>. Ele inventou a primeira máquina de barbear eléctrica a seco de sucesso. Começou no negócio das máquinas de barbear em 1925 para conceber e fabricar a sua invenção da revista "Repeating Razor". Em 1926, vendia clips de lâminas que podiam ser carregados numa máquina de barbear de segurança sem tocar na lâmina para evitar cortes durante o manuseamento. Enquanto este produto era bem sucedido, ele voltou a sua atenção para o desenvolvimento de uma lâmina de barbear seca. Em 1927, tinha concebido uma lâmina de barbear seca com uma cabeça de corte alternada, alimentada por um eixo de transmissão flexível para um motor externo. Embora tenha comercializado este modelo a partir de 1929, só em 1931 é que tinha melhorado a ideia como uma nova máquina de barbear eléctrica com uma só mão com motor autónomo que as vendas descolaram.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje  anos que nascia, em 1919, o inventor norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Middlemark">Marvin Middlemark</a>. Ele criou a antena de televisão "orelhas de coelho" entre as suas muitas patentes (1956-68) para electrónica de consumo (e ideias menores como um descascador de batatas movido a água), tornou-se um milionário que se fez sozinho.</p>

<p>Hoje é o dia internacional da protecção da camada de Ozono. Em 1987, nesta mesma data foi assinado, em Montreal no Canada, o protocolo que viria a estabelecer um conjunto de normas para proteger a camada de ozono através da eliminação gradual da produção de numerosas substâncias responsáveis pelo empobrecimento da mesma. Os compostos mais famosos são os CFCs - clorofluorcarbonetos - são compostos que possuem os átomos de cloro e flúor ligados a cadeias carbónicas, em geral, pequenas, como ao metano e ao etano. Portanto, eles fazem parte do grupo funcional dos haletos orgânicos. Até aos anos 70, estes gases eram amplamente utilizados como propulsores em aerossóis de perfume e insecticidas, como refrigerantes em frigoríficos e aparelhos de ar condicionado, e como gases de sopro para a produção de polímeros sob a forma de espumas. A sua utilização tornou-se generalizada devido às vantagens que estes compostos tinham, tais como serem inodoros, não tóxicos, e não inflamáveis. Contudo, quando um produto pulverizador que os continha era utilizado ou quando havia uma fuga no equipamento que os continha, os CFC eram libertados na atmosfera e descobriu-se que eram a causa do buraco na camada de ozono.</p>

<p>Começou por criar uma calculadora inovadora em 1972, foi responsável pela criação de computadores de baixo custo para utilização em casa ligados à televisão. Foi um percursor dos computadores pessoais como os conhecemos hoje. Na década de 80 criou o ZX80, o ZX81 e o mais famoso ZX Spectrum que permitiram a milhares de pessoas darem os primeiros passos na programação e servirem de inspiração a muitas gerações. Sir Clive Sinclair faleceu hoje aos 81 anos na sua casa em Londres.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou quatro norte-americanos descolaram do Centro Espacial Kennedy, na Florida a bordo de da cápsula Dragon da SpaceX, para uma viagem espacial de três dias. A grande novidade é que nenhum deles é um astronauta. Lançada acoplada ao foguetão Falcon 9, esta missão teve o nome de baptismo "Inspiration4" é considerada a primeira missão espacial totalmente civil e é também considerada o primeiro passo para uma abertura do espaço à sociedade civil. A bordo seguem o milionário Jared Isaacman, acompanhado por Hayley Arceneaux, Sian Proctor e Chris Sembroski. Todos eles foram treinados durante cerca de seis meses na base da SpaceX.</p>

<p><em>"SpaceX made history tonight as it launched a crew of private citizens on a jaunt around Earth. For an added bonus, the rocket landed on its drone ship, marking the company's 92nd booster recovery. The mission, called Inspiration4, blasted off from Pad 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center here in Florida at 8:02 p.m. EDT (0002 GMT) — the start of a planned five-hour window. A four-person crew was strapped inside a Crew Dragon spacecraft which sat perched atop a slightly sooty 229-feet-tall (70 meters) Falcon 9 rocket. "Few have come before, and many are about to follow," Inspiration4 Cmdr. Jared Issacman said from inside the Crew Dragon spacecraft, referring to civilians in space."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-launches-inspiration4-civilian-orbital-mission">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Some volcanoes can produce eruptions so powerful they release oceans of dust and toxic gases into the air, blocking out sunlight and changing a planet’s climate for decades. By studying the topography and mineral composition of a portion of the Arabia Terra region in northern Mars, scientists recently found evidence for thousands of such eruptions, or “super eruptions,” which are the most violent volcanic explosions known. Spewing water vapor, carbon dioxide, and sulfur dioxide into the air, these explosions tore through the Martian surface over a 500-million-year period about 4 billion years ago. Scientists reported this estimate in a paper published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters in July 2021. “Each one of these eruptions would have had a significant climate impact — maybe the released gas made the atmosphere thicker or blocked the Sun and made the atmosphere colder,” said Patrick Whelley, a geologist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, who led the Arabia Terra analysis. “Modelers of the Martian climate will have some work to do to try to understand the impact of the volcanoes.” After blasting the equivalent of 400 million Olympic-size swimming pools of molten rock and gas through the surface and spreading a thick blanket of ash up to thousands of miles from the eruption site, a volcano of this magnitude collapses into a giant hole called a “caldera.” Calderas, which also exist on Earth, can be dozens of miles wide."</em> <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/news/9039/nasa-confirms-thousands-of-massive-ancient-volcanic-eruptions-on-mars/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"NASA’s Perseverance Mars rover successfully collected its first pair of rock samples, and scientists already are gaining new insights into the region. After collecting its first sample, named “Montdenier,” Sept. 6, the team collected a second, “Montagnac,” from the same rock Sept. 8. Analysis of the rocks from which the Montdenier and Montagnac samples were taken and from the rover’s previous sampling attempt may help the science team piece together the timeline of the area’s past, which was marked by volcanic activity and periods of persistent water. “It looks like our first rocks reveal a potentially habitable sustained environment,” said Ken Farley of Caltech, project scientist for the mission, which is led by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Southern California. “It’s a big deal that the water was there a long time.” The rock that provided the mission’s first core samples is basaltic in composition and may be the product of lava flows. The presence of crystalline minerals in volcanic rocks is especially helpful in radiometric dating."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-perseverance-rover-collects-puzzle-pieces-of-mars-history">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.global.toshiba/ww/technology/corporate/rdc/rd/topics/21/2109-01.html">Toshiba’s Polymer Film-Based Perovskite Large-Area Photovoltaic Module Reaches Record Power Conversion Efficiency of 15.1%</a></h2>

<p><em>"Toshiba Corporation (TOKYO: 6502), the world-leader in development of perovskite photovoltaic modules for next-generation solar power generation, has developed a new coating method for the perovskite layer that boosts power conversion efficiency (PCE) to 15.1% for Toshiba’s 703cm2 module*1, the highest for any large, polymer film-based perovskite photovoltaic module*2. The innovative coating method for perovskite layer also greatly reduces production time and costs, contributing to a lower cost for solar power generation. Success in achieving carbon neutrality will require much greater use of photovoltaic power generation, and a significant expansion in locations where photovoltaic modules can be installed. Today’s most widely used photovoltaic modules are made with crystalline silicon and are heavy, and this, plus their rigidity, limits where they can be installed. The polymer film-based perovskite photovoltaic module is an attractive next-generation alternative, as it is thin, light and flexible, and can be installed in locations where it is difficult to use silicon photovoltaic modules, such as low load-bearing roofs and office windows. Recent improvements in the PCE of perovskite photovoltaic modules has brought them to a level comparable to that of silicon photovoltaic modules."</em> <a href="https://www.global.toshiba/ww/technology/corporate/rdc/rd/topics/21/2109-01.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Arm, in collaboration with leaders across the automotive supply chain, today announced it is delivering a new software architecture and reference implementation, Scalable Open Architecture for Embedded Edge (SOAFEE), and two new reference hardware platforms to accelerate the software-defined future of automotive. As vehicle architectures and capabilities evolve, automotive developers today are challenged by the increasing code complexity needed to deliver Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), In-vehicle Infotainment systems (IVI), electrified powertrains, and autonomy. To meet these evolving consumer demands, computing must become more centralized, and software is increasingly critical to allowing this. The resulting changes to how software is being developed, deployed, and managed means that cloud-native development, best known for driving reductions in cost, time and complexity across the cloud infrastructure industry, is more applicable to automotive development than ever before. However, to address the software-defined needs of cars today quickly and seamlessly, it is imperative to deliver a standardized framework that enhances proven cloud-native technologies that work at scale with the real-time and safety features required in automotive applications. This same framework can also benefit other real-time and safety-critical use cases such as robotics and industrial automation."</em> <a href="https://www.arm.com/company/news/2021/09/new-arm-technologies-to-transform-the-software-defined-future-for-the-automotive-industry">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Renesas Electronics Corporation (TSE:6723), a premier supplier of advanced semiconductor solutions, and OmniVision Technologies, Inc., a leading developer of advanced digital imaging solutions, today introduced an integrated reference design for a High Definition automotive camera system. The new design features Renesas’ recently introduced Automotive HD Link (AHL) technology that transmits high-definition video over low-cost cables and connectors. The AHL components in the design pair with OmniVision's OX01F10 1.3MP SoC, which provides the industry's best imaging performance across a wide range of challenging lighting conditions, along with the most compact form factor and lowest power consumption. HD video is increasingly important in car safety systems for object recognition functionality. The new RAA279971 AHL encoder and RAA279972 decoder use a modulated analog signal to transmit the video, enabling transmission rates 10 times less than required to transmit HD signals digitally. The lower transmission rate means that unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cables and standard low-cost connectors can be used, as can existing traditional analog video cables and connectors."</em> <a href="https://www.renesas.com/eu/en/about/press-room/renesas-and-omnivision-deliver-integrated-reference-design-automotive-camera-systems">[...]</a>

By aiming subatomic particles known as neutrons at silicon crystals and monitoring the outcome with exquisite sensitivity, the NIST scientists were able to obtain three extraordinary results: the first measurement of a key neutron property in 20 years using a unique method; the highest-precision measurements of the effects of heat-related vibrations in a silicon crystal; and limits on the strength of a possible “fifth force” beyond standard physics theories. The researchers report their findings in the journal Science. To obtain information about crystalline materials at the atomic scale, scientists typically aim a beam of particles (such as X-rays, electrons or neutrons) at the crystal and detect the beam’s angles, intensities and patterns as it passes through or ricochets off planes in the crystal’s lattice-like atomic geometry.

<p><em>"Dark energy, the mysterious force that causes the universe to accelerate, may have been responsible for unexpected results from the XENON1T experiment, deep below Italy’s Apennine Mountains. A new study, led by researchers at the University of Cambridge and reported in the journal Physical Review D, suggests that some unexplained results from the XENON1T experiment in Italy may have been caused by dark energy, and not the dark matter the experiment was designed to detect. They constructed a physical model to help explain the results, which may have originated from dark energy particles produced in a region of the Sun with strong magnetic fields, although future experiments will be required to confirm this explanation. The researchers say their study could be an important step toward the direct detection of dark energy. Everything our eyes can see in the skies and in our everyday world – from tiny moons to massive galaxies, from ants to blue whales – makes up less than five percent of the universe. The rest is dark."</em> <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/have-we-detected-dark-energy-cambridge-scientists-say-its-a-possibility">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Berkeley Lab research brings us closer to understanding how our universe began Scientists have reported new clues to solving a cosmic conundrum: How the quark-gluon plasma – nature’s perfect fluid – evolved into matter. A few millionths of a second after the Big Bang, the early universe took on a strange new state: a subatomic soup called the quark-gluon plasma. And just 15 years ago, an international team including researchers from the Relativistic Nuclear Collisions (RNC) group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) discovered that this quark-gluon plasma is a perfect fluid – in which quarks and gluons, the building blocks of protons and neutrons, are so strongly coupled that they flow almost friction-free. Scientists postulated that highly energetic jets of particles fly through the quark-gluon plasma – a droplet the size of an atom’s nucleus – at speeds faster than the velocity of sound, and that like a fast-flying jet, emit a supersonic boom called a Mach wave. To study the properties of these jet particles, in 2014 a team led by Berkeley Lab scientists pioneered an atomic X-ray imaging technique called jet tomography. Results from those seminal studies revealed that these jets scatter and lose energy as they propagate through the quark-gluon plasma."</em> <a href="https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2021/09/16/closer-look-inside-perfect-fluid/">[...]</a>

When scientists study unconventional superconductors – complex materials that conduct electricity with zero loss at relatively high temperatures – they often rely on simplified models to get an understanding of what’s going on. Researchers know these quantum materials get their abilities from electrons that join forces to form a sort of electron soup. But modeling this process in all its complexity would take far more time and computing power than anyone can imagine having today. So for understanding one key class of unconventional superconductors – copper oxides, or cuprates – researchers created, for simplicity, a theoretical model in which the material exists in just one dimension, as a string of atoms. They made these one-dimensional cuprates in the lab and found that their behavior agreed with the theory pretty well."</em> <a href="https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/news/2021-09-09-after-20-years-trying-scientists-succeed-doping-1d-chain-cuprates.aspx">[...]</a>

The new technology could be useful for searching for drowning victims, documenting submerged archaeological artifacts and monitoring underwater farms. Imaging clearly underwater is extremely challenging because the water and the particles in it tend to scatter light. But, because scattered light is partially polarized, imaging using a camera that is sensitive to polarization can be used to suppress scattered light in underwater images. “Our new method overcomes the limitations of traditional polarimetric underwater imaging, laying the groundwork for taking this method out of the lab and into the field,” said research team leader Haofeng Hu from Tianjin University in China. “Unlike previous methods, there’s no requirement for the image to include a background area to estimate the backscattered light.” In The Optical Society (OSA) journal Optics Express, the researchers demonstrate their method’s ability to enhance image contrast while preserving image details without introducing considerable noise."</em> <a href="https://www.osa.org/en-us/about_osa/newsroom/news_releases/2021/new_technology_makes_it_possible_to_see_clearly_th/">[...]</a>

As we know, Microcontrollers (or MCUs) are very cheap electronic components, usually with just a few kilobytes of RAM, designed to use tiny amounts of energy. Nowadays, MCUs can be found embedded in almost any consumer, medical, automotive, and industrial devices. It is estimated that over 40 billion microcontrollers are sold every year, and probably hundreds of billions of them are in service nowadays."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/mjrobot/tinyml-made-easy-gesture-recognition-ce13a5">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The laser harp was born as a remake of an old project. The basic idea is to create a variation of a classic instrument such as the harp using current electronic technologies, such as microcontrollers, sensors and speakers. The structure is made of wood. It has the shape of a rectangle of 96x47x6 cm. On the longer sides there are two separate circuits: on one there are six lasers in a row aligned with the six photoresistors placed on the opposite side. Lasers (in series) are powered by a 4.5 V battery."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Laser-Harp/">[...]</a>

In the U.S, there is around 2 million kilometer of sewer pipes around the country that supported 240 millions U.S citizen. Every year, at least 23 000–75 000 sewer pipe failures are reported in the United States, which releases up to 3–10 billion gallons of untreated sewage to the environment. This leads to a high economic loss, water pollution, and threatens communal health. These sewer pipes need yearly maintained to keep functioning properly and avoid sewer overflow.

<p><em>"When building HF radio kits, one of the final steps before going on the air is to connect a 50-Ohm load and measure the RF power output. I used to do this by taking measurements with an oscilloscope and then calculating the power using formulas and a calculator. I built this project to automate this step by using an Arduino to measure the RF voltage, calculate the RF power and display the results. The circuit is relatively straightforward and it could be built using point-to-point wiring, but I decided to make the build easier by designing a circuit board. Referring to the schematic the circuit consists of a 50-Ohm load (made up of 8x 100-Ohm resistors) followed by a rectify/sample circuit which is then connected to an ADC (analog to digital) input pin of an Arduino Nano. The Nano is also connected via an I2C serial bus to an OLED display."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/RF-Load-With-Power-Meter-for-HF-Radios/">[...]</a>
