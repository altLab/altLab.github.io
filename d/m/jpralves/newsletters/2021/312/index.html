<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1724, o filósofo alemão, formado em matemática e física <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant">Immanuel Kant</a>. Ele publicou a sua História geral da natureza e teoria dos céus em 1755. Esta visão física do universo continha três antecipações importantes para os astrónomos. 1) Ele fez a hipótese da nebulosa antes de Laplace. 2) Ele descreveu a Via Láctea como uma colecção de estrelas em forma de lente que representava apenas um dos muitos "universos-ilha", mais tarde mostrado por Herschel. 3) Ele sugeriu que o atrito das marés diminuiu a rotação da Terra, o que foi confirmado um século depois. Em 1770 tornou-se professor de matemática, mas voltou-se para a metafísica e a lógica em 1797, o campo em que é mais conhecido.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1789, o engenheiro mecânico e inventor galês [Richard Roberts](Richard Roberts (engineer)). Ele foi responsável pela invenção do primeiro medidor de gás bem-sucedido. Ele foi um dos inventores das primeiras aplainadoras de metal (1817). Roberts também desenvolveu um torno de rosqueamento e máquinas para corte de engrenagens e ranhuras. A mula giratória auto-guiada (1825) que ele inventou foi sua contribuição mais importante para a indústria têxtil, que também fundou na França. Na década de 1830, a sua empresa construiu locomotivas ferroviárias numa das primeiras aplicações do uso de peças trocáveis. Na década de 1840, ele desenvolveu máquinas para fazer padrões de orifícios em pontes e placas de caldeira, automatizadas com cartões perfurados semelhantes ao tear Jacquard.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1834, o físico francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaston_Plant%C3%A9">Gaston Planté</a>. Ele construiu a primeira bateria de armazenamento (1859), que era capaz de fornecer electricidade e ser recarregada várias vezes. Até esta invenção, as baterias existiam desde a descoberta de Alessandro Volta, numa forma que podia ser usada e descarregada apenas uma vez. Planté fez o seu acumulador com uma placa de chumbo, enrolada com um separador de pano de linho, imerso em ácido sulfúrico. Ele tinha apenas um gerador de manivela. A sua bateria teve de esperar que a invenção posterior de dínamos satisfatórios se tornasse útil. A célula foi melhorada por Camille Faure, Sir Joseph Swan e outros. A bateria recarregável teve um uso importante para o telégrafo. Desde que foi adoptada pela primeira vez para uso em automóveis, a bateria de chumbo-ácido continua a ser usada com o mesmo desenho fundamental. Mais tarde, ele investigou a electricidade atmosférica.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1904, o físico teórico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer">J. Robert Oppenheimer</a>. Ele foi director do laboratório de Los Alamos durante o desenvolvimento da bomba atómica (1943-45) e director do Instituto de Estudos Avançados de Princeton (1947-66). As descobertas de Oppenheimer na física incluíram a aproximação de Born-Oppenheimer para funções de ondas moleculares, trabalho na teoria dos electrões e positrons, o processo Oppenheimer-Phillips na fusão nuclear e a primeira previsão de tunelamento quântico. Com seus alunos, ele também fez contribuições importantes para a teoria moderna de estrelas de neutrões e buracos negros, bem como para a mecânica quântica, teoria de campo quântico e as interacções dos raios cósmicos. Como professor e promotor da ciência, ele é lembrado como o pai fundador da escola americana de física teórica que ganhou destaque mundial na década de 1930.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1919, o químico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_J._Cram">Donald J. Cram</a>. Ele partilhou o Prémio Nobel de Química de 1987 (com Charles J. Pedersen e Jean-Marie Lehn) pela sua criação de moléculas que imitam o comportamento químico de moléculas encontradas em sistemas vivos.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1929, o matemático britânico de origem libanesa <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Atiyah">Michael Atiyah</a>. Ele recebeu a Medalha Fields em 1966 principalmente por seu trabalho em topologia. Juntamente com Hirzebruch, ele lançou as bases para a teoria-K topológica, uma ferramenta importante na topologia algébrica, que, informalmente, descreve as maneiras pelas quais os espaços podem ser torcidos. O seu resultado mais conhecido, o teorema do índice Atiyah – Singer, foi provado com Singer em 1963 e é usado na contagem do número de soluções independentes para equações diferenciais. Alguns dos seus trabalhos mais recentes foram inspirados pela física teórica, em particular instantons e monopoles, que são responsáveis por algumas correcções subtis na teoria quântica de campos.</p>

<p>E nesta semana que passou o Drone Ingenuity Mars da NASA é bem-sucedido no primeiro voo histórico. Na passada segunda-feira, o Drone tornou-se a primeira aeronave da história a fazer um voo motorizado e controlado noutro planeta. A equipa Ingenuity do Jet Propulsion Laboratory da agência no sul da Califórnia confirmou o sucesso do voo após receber dados do drone via Perseverance Mars rover da NASA às 6:46 am EDT (3:46 am PDT). A demonstração de voo inicial do Ingenuity foi autónoma - pilotada por sistemas de orientação, navegação e controle a bordo, executando algoritmos desenvolvidos pela equipa do JPL. Como os dados devem ser enviados e devolvidos do Planeta Vermelho ao longo de centenas de milhões de quilómetros usando satélites em órbita e a Deep Space Network da NASA, o Ingenuity não pode ser pilotado com um joystick e seu voo não foi observado da Terra em tempo real. Entretanto o drone já cumpriu com sucesso uma segunda missão de voo.</p>

<p>Também esta semana foi lançada a nova versão do Sistema Operativo da Canonical, o Ubuntu 21.04. Este sistema baseia-se no kernel Linux e na distro Debian. As grande novidades desta versão são a integração nativa com a AD e a certificação do Microsoft SQL Server para ser usado nesta distribuição de Linux. Adicionalmente foram actualizados os mais diversos pacotes de software. Não foi incluído ainda o GNOME 40 nem o GTK4 porque estes são muito recentes e não foi possível na janela de tempo inclui-los sem impacto nas restantes aplicações. Esta versão inclui o Kernel Linux 5.11, um tema "dark" melhorado, utilização do Wayland por omissão e o Python 3.9.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker assim como alguns videos interessantes. É apresentada a revista Hackspace Magazine nº43 de Maio.</p>

<p><em>"Monday, NASA’s Ingenuity Mars Helicopter became the first aircraft in history to make a powered, controlled flight on another planet. The Ingenuity team at the agency’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California confirmed the flight succeeded after receiving data from the helicopter via NASA’s Perseverance Mars rover at 6:46 a.m. EDT (3:46 a.m. PDT). “Ingenuity is the latest in a long and storied tradition of NASA projects achieving a space exploration goal once thought impossible,” said acting NASA Administrator Steve Jurczyk. “The X-15 was a pathfinder for the space shuttle. Mars Pathfinder and its Sojourner rover did the same for three generations of Mars rovers. We don’t know exactly where Ingenuity will lead us, but today’s results indicate the sky – at least on Mars – may not be the limit.” The solar-powered helicopter first became airborne at 3:34 a.m. EDT (12:34 a.m. PDT) – 12:33 Local Mean Solar Time (Mars time) – a time the Ingenuity team determined would have optimal energy and flight conditions."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-succeeds-in-historic-first-flight">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The growing list of “firsts” for Perseverance, NASA’s newest six-wheeled robot on the Martian surface, includes converting some of the Red Planet’s thin, carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere into oxygen. A toaster-size, experimental instrument aboard Perseverance called the Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) accomplished the task. The test took place April 20, the 60th Martian day, or sol, since the mission landed Feb. 18. While the technology demonstration is just getting started, it could pave the way for science fiction to become science fact – isolating and storing oxygen on Mars to help power rockets that could lift astronauts off the planet’s surface. Such devices also might one day provide breathable air for astronauts themselves. MOXIE is an exploration technology investigation – as is the Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyzer (MEDA) weather station – and is sponsored by NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) and Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-perseverance-mars-rover-extracts-first-oxygen-from-red-planet">[...]</a>

<p><em>"By Using Certified RX MCUs, Customers Can Easily Develop Devices Meeting Security Requirements Renesas Electronics Corporation (TSE:6723), a premier supplier of advanced semiconductor solutions, today announced that its 32-bit RX65N microcontroller (MCU) has achieved Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) (Note 1) Level 3 certification under the FIPS 140-2 security standard by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The RX65N is the world’s first general-purpose MCU to obtain level 3 certification (Note 2). The FIPS 140 standard is an essential security requirement for applications used by government agencies, financial institutions, public facilities, and infrastructure, and it is becoming a de facto standard for security worldwide. Level 3 is a high security level with tamper detection/response and identity-based authentication mechanisms for devices used to handle financial information such as hardware security modules (HSMs) and smart cards. Using the certified RX65N MCU will make it easier for customers to develop devices with robust and trustworthy security functions, which will contribute to a reduction in the development workload and reduced overall security risks. “As more IoT devices gain network connectivity, the danger of malicious threats such as data leaks, data tampering, and spoofing grows, making security more important than ever,” said Sakae Ito, Vice President of IoT Platform Business Division at Renesas."</em> <a href="https://www.renesas.com/eu/en/about/press-room/renesas-rx-mcu-becomes-world-s-first-general-purpose-mcu-obtain-cmvp-level-3-certification-under">[...]</a>

<p><em>"New technology developed by Berkeley Lab and UC Berkeley could steer plastics away from landfills and oceans – and into your backyard compost bin Despite our efforts to sort and recycle, less than 9% of plastic gets recycled in the U.S., and most ends up in landfill or the environment. Biodegradable plastic bags and containers could help, but if they’re not properly sorted, they can contaminate otherwise recyclable #1 and #2 plastics. What’s worse, most biodegradable plastics take months to break down, and when they finally do, they form microplastics – tiny bits of plastic that can end up in oceans and animals’ bodies – including our own. Now, as reported today in the journal Nature, scientists at the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) and UC Berkeley have designed an enzyme-activated compostable plastic that could diminish microplastics pollution, and holds great promise for plastics upcycling. The material can be broken down to its building blocks – small individual molecules called monomers – and then reformed into a new compostable plastic product. “In the wild, enzymes are what nature uses to break things down – and even when we die, enzymes cause our bodies to decompose naturally."</em> <a href="https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2021/04/21/compostable-plastic-nature/">[...]</a>

In addition to brighter X-ray beams, the ALS Upgrade (ALS-U) project will enable the ALS to deliver light with a more ordered “coherent” structure – like evenly spaced ripples in a pond – that will better reveal nanoscale (billionths of a meter) details in complex chemical reactions and in new materials. “For nearly three decades, the ALS has developed innovative X-ray tools and used these to support a world-renowned portfolio of user science and collaboration,” said ALS Director Steve Kevan. “The ALS upgrade will allow us to vastly sharpen our tools and to accelerate that work for several more decades as we learn to design chemical, material, and biological systems that will solve the pressing energy and environmental challenges we face.” This latest approval by DOE, known as Critical Decision 2 or CD-2, marks the completion of the preliminary design stage of the project. It also authorizes a $590 million budget and funding profile for the project, and outlines the scope and schedule. “I am proud of the talented engineers, scientists, technicians, and support staff who helped the Lab achieve CD-2 approval for the Advanced Light Source Upgrade project during these challenging times."</em> <a href="https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2021/04/16/advanced-light-source-upgrade-project-achieves-major-milestone/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scientists in Switzerland have demonstrated a new method for manufacturing photonic integrated circuits from very low-loss silicon nitride in high-yield wafers. The researchers say the technology could allow frequency combs and other nonlinear devices to be mass-produced using conventional semiconductor fabrication techniques (Nat. Commun., doi: 10.1038/s41467-021-21973-z). Microcombs and materials Best known for underpinning modern electronics, straightforward silicon has also played a role in integrated photonics. It has been deployed widely, for example, in the form of data center interconnects. But silicon has limitations when it comes to making nonlinear devices such as micro-scale frequency combs, or “microcombs.” These tiny ring-shaped resonators exploit the Kerr effect, a change in refractive index as light’s intensity varies."</em> <a href="https://www.osa-opn.org/home/newsroom/2021/april/low-loss_silicon_nitride_served_up_on_a_wafer/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A new study outlines the need for materials advances in the hardware that goes into making quantum computers if these futuristic devices are to surpass the abilities of the computers we use today. The study(link is external), published in the journal Science by an international team, surveyed the state of research on quantum computing hardware with the goal of illustrating the challenges and opportunities facing scientists and engineers. While conventional computers encode "bits" of information as ones and zeroes, quantum computers breeze past this binary arrangement by creating "qubits," which can be complex, continuous quantities. Storing and manipulating information in this exotic form – and ultimately reaching "quantum advantage" where quantum computers do things that conventional computers cannot – requires sophisticated control of the underlying materials. “There has been an explosion in developing quantum technologies over the last 20 years,” said Nathalie de Leon, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at Princeton University and the lead author of the paper, “culminating in current efforts to show quantum advantage for a variety of tasks, from computing and simulation to networking and sensing.” Until recently, most of this work has aimed to demonstrate proof-of-principle quantum devices and processors, de Leon said, but now the field is poised to address real-world challenges. “Just as classical computing hardware became an enormous field in materials science and engineering in the last century, I think the quantum technologies field is now ripe for a new approach, where materials scientists, chemists, device engineers and other scientists and engineers can productively bring their expertise to bear on the problem.” The paper is a call to scientists who study materials to turn to the challenge of developing hardware for quantum computing, said Hanhee Paik(link is external), corresponding author and a research staff member at IBM Quantum(link is external)."</em> <a href="https://ece.princeton.edu/news/materials-advances-are-key-development-quantum-hardware">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In the field of robotics, researchers are continually looking for the fastest, strongest, most efficient and lowest-cost ways to actuate, or enable, robots to make the movements needed to carry out their intended functions. The quest for new and better actuation technologies and “soft” robotics is often based on principles of biomimetics, in which machine components are designed to mimic the movement of human muscles—and ideally, to outperform them. Despite the performance of actuators like electric motors and hydraulic pistons, their rigid form limits how they can be deployed. As robots transition to more biological forms and as people ask for more biomimetic prostheses, actuators need to evolve. Associate professor and alumnus Michael Shafer and professor Heidi Feigenbaum of Northern Arizona University’s Department of Mechanical Engineering, along with graduate student researcher Diego Higueras-Ruiz, published a paper in Science Robotics presenting a new, high-performance artificial muscle technology they developed in NAU’s Dynamic Active Systems Laboratory.

<p><em>"Since fast radio bursts (FRBs) were first discovered over a decade ago, scientists have puzzled over what could be generating these intense flashes of radio waves from outside of our galaxy. In a gradual process of elimination, the field of possible explanations has narrowed as new pieces of information are gathered about FRBs – how long they last, the frequencies of the radio waves detected, and so on. Now, a team led by McGill University researchers and members of Canada’s CHIME Fast Radio Burst collaboration has established that FRBs include radio waves at frequencies lower than ever detected before, a discovery that redraws the boundaries for theoretical astrophysicists trying to put their finger on the source of FRBs. “We detected fast radio bursts down to 110 MHz where before these bursts were only known to exist down to 300 MHz,” explained Ziggy Pleunis, a postdoctoral researcher in McGill’s Department of Physics and lead author of the research recently published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. “This tells us that the region around the source of the bursts must be transparent to low-frequency emission, whereas some theories suggested that all low-frequency emission would be absorbed right away and could never be detected.” The study focussed on an FRB source first detected in 2018 by the CHIME radio telescope in British Columbia. Known as FRB 20180916B, the source has attracted particular attention because of its relative proximity to Earth and the fact that it emits FRBs at regular intervals."</em> <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/channels/news/fast-radio-bursts-shown-include-lower-frequency-radio-waves-previously-detected-330412">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A very low power consumption rechargeable temperature and humidity monitor that can run off a rechargeable battery for 12 days or more. Story I needed a temperature and humidity sensor that would show maximum and minimum levels recorded so that I could monitor the levels in my greenhouse. I do not have any power in the greenhouse so the aim was to reduce power consumption as much as possible so that it could run on a rechargeable battery for long periods. The solution to this was to have the Arduino enter a low power state for a period before waking and taking new reading then repeating the cycle. To achieve this I used the rocketscream low power library to put the processor to sleep, waking every 24 seconds to check the temperature and humidity, which takes less than a second.

<p><em>"Many modular synthesizer systems use Control Voltages (CV) to pass note information from one module to the other. When I started building my first modular VCO, I didn't have a keyboard/sequencer capable of outputting CV signals, so I cooked up this project that uses a Seeduino Xiao microcontroller and a handful of parts to make a fairly respectable CV sequencer. The code and schematics can be downloaded from my github. DISCLAIMER: Use at your own risk! In other words, before you hook this up to your fancy modular system or analog system, test it out on a multimeter, test equipment, junky module or whatever you're not worried about in case you get the magic smoke. I've tested it on a couple of my DIY oscillator modules and nothing has blown up."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Xiao-CV-Sequencer/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The TEJ2O0 engineering course is an outstanding course that teaches one many things about the computer and basic electronic circuits. One of the main highlights of this course is the Arduino Uno, specifically learning to code using it. This project demonstrates this skill and is easy to make. The Burglar Alarm is a device that alerts the user if any form of motion is detected. Further, it sounds a 'siren' if the motion or in this case the 'burglar' is within a certain distance. Else, it will notify the user that all is clear and there is no motion detected via the LCD monitor."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Burglar-Alarm-1/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The EnderLoop is an Ender 3 conversion mod that turns it into a conveyor belt printer. While this is similar to the CR-30, this mod costs about 1/3 of the price (including the cost of an Ender 3) which increases the accessibility of belt printing, offers more mod flexibility since the core mechanics are those of the Ender 3 which already has a plethora of mods available online, and is available right now. Also, since the support extensions are 3d printed, you can cheaply and effectively add longer support than other belt printers available. The tradeoffs are that it is a bit slower than the CR-30 and requires some DIY know-how with printers. It is currently fully functional (including firmware and slicing configuration for BlackBelt Cura) and ready for anyone who is comfortable modding their printer to use. Also happy to answer any questions."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/EnderLoop/">[...]</a>

Statistically it does not appear to be spread by surfaces so a lot of the rules that we use for keeping safe are unlikely to help--breath barriers, obsessive washing of everything. Incredible real life examples of how it is spread are now obvious in retrospect: an airplane packed with 400 spreaders of virus, not respecting distancing, half the time with their masks off, no breath barriers between seats--no one gets COVID. Why? Airplanes change out their air once every three minutes and 75% of it is from outside.

I need it to monitor the temperature of my turtles i keep in the garden :) One sensor measures the outside temperature and the other one measures the temperature in the greenhouse. As this is all working with mqtt so i combined it with tasmota powered sockets to automate heaters or lamps. Over this 2 years i learned a lot which i want to improve with this build - DHT sensors are good for learning / education but not for real usage - the humidity measurement is just garbage values are most of the time 99% or the sensors hang. - if the wifi connection is not possible it trys to reconnect until the battery is empty."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/E-ink-Weather-Station/">[...]</a>

They can be used for wireless communication, wireless data transfer, networks of wireless devices and remote-controlled robots. For a great tutorial on how to use them, I suggest the DroneBot Workshop tutorial (click here), which also has a YouTube video. The transceiver module uses the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) which is a convenient method for data transfer between electrical components wired together. There are some caveats to using the nRF24L01 transceiver however. They are powered with 3.3 volts, rather than the 5 volts that most Arduinos typically use."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Arduino-Adapter-for-the-NRF24L01-1/">[...]</a>
