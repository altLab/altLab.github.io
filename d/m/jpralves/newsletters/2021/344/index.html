<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1761, o inventor francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis-Nicolas_Robert">Nicolas Louis Robert</a>. Ele foi responsável pela invenção da máquina de papel contínua, enquanto trabalhava na Essonnes, França, fábrica de papel da família Didot de impressoras e editores. Fez o seu primeiro modelo para o processo em 1797, um protótipo em 1798, e obteve uma patente em 18 de Janeiro de 1799. O papel foi formado e transportado numa cinta móvel de gaze de arame. Didot foi no início céptico, depois encorajou Robert a melhorar a invenção, ainda imperfeita. Depois de Robert ter ficado insatisfeito com o acordo financeiro dos seus esforços, partiu e tentou montar a sua própria fábrica de papel. Quando este empreendimento falhou por falta de capital, ele vendeu os direitos de patente à Didot. A sua ideia acabou por ser desenvolvida com mais sucesso em Inglaterra pelos irmãos Fourdrinier, assistidos pelo mecânico Bryan Donkin.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1881, o físico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Barkhausen">Heinrich Barkhausen</a>. Ele descobriu o efeito Barkhausen (1919), um princípio relativo às alterações das propriedades magnéticas do metal. O seu trabalho em acústica e magnetismo levou à descoberta de que a magnetização afecta domínios inteiros de um material ferromagnético, e não apenas os átomos individuais. Descobriu que um aumento lento e suave de um campo magnético aplicado a uma peça de material ferromagnético, como o ferro, provoca a sua magnetização, não contínua mas em passos minúsculos. Com Karl Kurz, desenvolveu o oscilador Barkhausen- Kurz (1920) para frequências ultra-altas (precursor do tubo de micro-ondas), levando à compreensão do princípio da modulação da velocidade. É também conhecido por experiências em transmissões de rádio de ondas curtas.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1905, o inventor germano-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi_Joseph_Begun">Semi Joseph Begun</a>. Ele construiu o primeiro gravador para radiodifusão (1934), que mais tarde foi utilizado nos Jogos Olímpicos de 1936. Após a II Guerra Mundial, continuou a trabalhar em suportes de gravação magnéticos baseados no revestimento de papel e fita plástica com suspensões ferromagnéticas em pó. Begun desenvolveu o primeiro gravador de fita de consumo nos Estados Unidos sob o nome comercial Sound Mirror. Também negociou o primeiro acordo de fornecimento de fita magnética com a 3M - que se tornou uma importante linha de produtos. Também inventou o Mail-A-Voice, que gravou magneticamente num dos lados de um disco de papel para correspondência postal.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1906, o engenheiro húngaro-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Carl_Goldmark">Peter Carl Goldmark</a>. Ele, enquanto trabalhava para a Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), desenvolveu o primeiro sistema comercial de televisão a cores (1936), que utilizava um disco de três cores rotativo. Embora inicialmente aprovado pela Comissão Federal de Comunicações, foi posteriormente substituído por um sistema de cor totalmente electrónico que era compatível com conjuntos a preto e branco. A Goldmark também desenvolveu o fonógrafo LP 33-1/3 que aumentou grandemente o tempo de reprodução de discos, o que revolucionou a indústria fonográfica. Foi também pioneiro na gravação de cassetes de vídeo, e desenvolveu um sistema de digitalização utilizado pela nave espacial Lunar Orbiter em 1966 para transmitir fotografias à terra a partir da lua.</p>

<p>Em 1877, Louis-Paul Cailletet (1832-1913) tornou-se o primeiro a liquefazer oxigénio. Pouco tempo depois, foi também o primeiro a liquefazer azoto, hidrogénio, dióxido de azoto, monóxido de carbono, e acetileno. Cailletet percebeu que o fracasso de outros em liquefazer os gases permanentes, mesmo sob enormes pressões, foi explicado pelo conceito de temperatura crítica de Thomas Andrews. Ele conseguiu produzir oxigénio líquido ao permitir que o gás frio e comprimido se expandisse, dependendo do efeito descoberto por Joule e Thomson, que arrefeceu o gás até abaixo da sua temperatura crítica. Em experiências posteriores, liquefez nitrogénio e ar. Raoul Pictet, trabalhando de forma independente, utilizou uma técnica semelhante.</p>

<p>Faz hoje 50 anos que os russos conseguiam entrar na atmosfera de Marte com as naves gémeas Mars 2 e 3. "A Mars 2 sobre-corrigiu, e colocou a nave espacial num ângulo de descida demasiado inclinado para a atmosfera", diz Shindell, e o "lander" bateu com força em Marte antes mesmo de poder lançar o seu pára-quedas. "Quando atingiu a atmosfera, penso que estava a viajar algo como seis quilómetros por segundo". Marte 3, no entanto, conseguiu fazer tudo bem. Entrou na atmosfera marciana a 5,7 quilómetros por segundo, diz Shindell, mas foi capaz de travar no ar, lançar o seu pára-quedas, e tocar suavemente numa almofada de retrorocket thrust. Abriu as suas pétalas, ligou as suas câmaras, e tirou uma imagem cinzenta parcial e difusa antes de morrer, a maioria dos dados que recolheu nunca chegaram ao orbitador da Mars 3 para transmissão para a Terra.</p>

<p>Em 1942, o físico Enrico Fermi produz a primeira reacção nuclear em cadeia. Foi no Chicago Pile-1 (CP-1), o primeiro reactor nuclear artificial do mundo, que foi feita a primeira reacção em cadeia nuclear auto-sustentada de origem humana. Foi um esforço prodigioso. Físicos e funcionários, trabalhando 24 horas por dia, construíram uma malha de 57 camadas de metal de urânio e óxido de urânio incrustadas em blocos de grafite. Uma estrutura de madeira suportava a pilha de grafite. A reacção em cadeia fazia parte do Projecto Manhattan, um projecto secreto em tempo de guerra para desenvolver armas nucleares, que iniciou a era nuclear moderna. Esta foi uma descoberta que mudou o mundo.</p>

<p>Em 1982, era feito usado o primeiro coração artificial (o Jarvik-7) num paciente. Numa operação que durou mais de sete horas, o Dr. William C. DeVries substituiu o coração doente de Barney Clark. Este foi o primeiro de uma série de cinco implantes do coração artificial total do Jarvik durante os três anos seguintes. O primeiro paciente, Barney Clark de 61 anos de idade, sobreviveu durante 112 dias. Apenas outros quatro receberam o Jarvik como um coração substituto permanente. O segundo, William Schroeder, viveu 620 dias, morrendo em Agosto de 1986 aos 54 anos de idade. Outros pacientes receberam o coração artificial concebido por Robert K. Jarvik apenas como um dispositivo temporário enquanto aguardavam transplantes cardíacos.</p>

<p><em>"Toshiba Electronic Devices &amp; Storage Corporation ("Toshiba") has introduced two photocouplers, “TLP5705H” and “TLP5702H,” housed in a thin SO6L package, for use as insulated gate drivers for small to medium capacity IGBTs/MOSFETs. Volume shipments start today. TLP5705H is Toshiba’s first product to deliver a peak output current rating of ±5.0A in a thin package (SO6L) only 2.3mm (max) high. As a result, devices such as small to medium capacity inverters and servo amplifiers that use a buffer circuit for current amplification can now drive their IGBTs/MOSFETs directly from the photocoupler, without any need of the buffer circuit. This will contribute to parts reduction and set miniaturisation. TLP5702H has a peak output current rating of ±2.5A."</em> <a href="https://toshiba.semicon-storage.com/ap-en/company/news/news-topics/2021/11/opto-20211130-1.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The MotoGP veteran took a Venturi Voxan Wattman electric motorcycle to a former NASA runway and beat his own speed record by 30 mph. Last week, legendary MotoGP rider Max Biaggi hopped on a modified Venturi Voxan Wattman electric motorcycle and took a top-secret ride down a decommissioned NASA runway in Florida—the same one where the Space Shuttle used to land. In the process, he broke 18 land-speed records for electric motorcycles, including top speed, averaging 283 mph over two runs, one in each direction. With that, Biaggi broke his own electric motorcycle speed record, set just last year, when he took a previous version of the Wattman to 253 mph. All of which begs the question: Why? "I saw that it started to be realistic, what Voxan was saying—that they could build the bike better to break the record," Biaggi told Road &amp; Track in a one-on-one interview at the Classic Car Club Manhattan, where the electric motorcycle maker hosted a party to announce the new top-speed record."</em> <a href="https://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a38387770/max-biaggi-shatters-ev-motorcycle-speed-record-with-283-mph-run/">[...]</a>

The Russian anti-satellite missile test, which shattered the defunct nearly 2-ton surveillance satellite Cosmos 1408 into thousands of pieces on Nov. 15, prompted indignation from the international space community. Companies and governmental organizations including NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and Earth-observation company Planet, issued statements condemning Russia's act as irresponsible and malicious. Until now, SpaceX, currently the biggest operator of satellites in the affected patch of space, remained silent. Responding to a Twitter thread discussing NASA's decision on Nov. 30 to cancel a planned spacewalk because of space debris risk, Musk admitted that his company's satellites did come close to the Russian anti-satellite test (or ASAT) debris.

<p><em>"A team of researchers from the U.S. National Science Foundation Center for Sustainable Polymers based at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities have developed a chemical technology of combined fermentation and chemical refining that can produce petroleum-like liquids from renewable plants. These renewable liquids could serve as a more sustainable replacement for today’s fossil fuels used to make everyday products like plastic containers and bags, automobile parts, lubricants, and soaps. The new study by scientists at the University of California Berkeley and the University of Minnesota is published online in Nature Chemistry, a leading peer-reviewed chemistry journal by Nature Publishing Group. It has been difficult for scientists to use plants as a source for plastics because they are mostly made up of sugars which are nothing like the molecules obtained from petroleum. The key sugar in plants is glucose, which contains too much oxygen and at six carbons is too small for many important applications. In order to use plants to make new materials, both problems must be solved—the conversion process needs to strip oxygen atoms from the glucose, and molecules must be combined to make larger products."</em> <a href="https://twin-cities.umn.edu/news-events/chemical-researchers-invent-bio-petroleum-sustainable-materials">[...]</a>

The new system can produce crisp, full-color images on par with a conventional compound camera lens 500,000 times larger in volume, the researchers reported in a paper published Nov. 29 in Nature Communications. Enabled by a joint design of the camera’s hardware and computational processing, the system could enable minimally invasive endoscopy with medical robots to diagnose and treat diseases, and improve imaging for other robots with size and weight constraints. Arrays of thousands of such cameras could be used for full-scene sensing, turning surfaces into cameras.

Detecting light beyond the visible red range of our eyes is hard to do, because infrared light carries so little energy compared to ambient heat at room temperature. This obscures infrared light unless specialised detectors are chilled to very low temperatures, which is both expensive and energy-intensive. Now researchers led by the University of Cambridge have demonstrated a new concept in detecting infrared light, showing how to convert it into visible light, which is easily detected. In collaboration with colleagues from the UK, Spain and Belgium, the team used a single layer of molecules to absorb the mid-infrared light inside their vibrating chemical bonds.

<p><em>"The Yamaha DX7 digital synthesizer (1983) was the classic synthesizer for 1980s pop music. It used two custom digital chips to generate sounds with FM synthesis. In this blog post, I examine the log-sine ROM that digitally produces sine waves inside one of these chips. (This blog post jumps into the details; unless you care about the sine values specifically, my previous DX7 reverse-engineering article is probably more interesting.) I created the high-resolution die photo below by compositing over a hundred microscope photos. I removed the metal layer from the chip with acid to reveal the silicon and polysilicon wiring underneath."</em> <a href="http://www.righto.com/2021/12/yamaha-dx7-reverse-engineering-part-iii.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In this project we will use a Wemos D1 Mini to create a tiny Minigame-console. In this project we create a very small minigame-console that uses a gyroscope to get the inputs from the user. This way we don't have to worry about buttons and where to fit them, which makes it a lot easier to build. Because I wanted to make it portable, I added a battery shield and a small 3.7V Lipo battery. This game-console also works without the battery shield and the battery, but then it needs an external power supply over the micro USB port of the D1 mini. I used an OLED 0.66" screen that can be directly stacked onto the battery shield or the Wemos D1 mini."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/galoebn/wemos-d1-minigame-console-f86e04">[...]</a>

With only a few external components it outputs PAL or NTSC video and can be connected to any TV or composite input of an analog monitor. This is a further development of the Nano VIC-20 project by Jan Ostmann. The core is an emulator function for the MOS 6502/6510 CPU. This executes the 16 kilobytes of kernal and basic ROM code permanently stored in the Arduino's flash memory. Since the Uno/Nano has only 2k RAM, which is almost used up by the video RAM and the system itself, the 1k EEPROM there is also used as RAM."</em> <a href="https://github.com/michalin/Arduino-C64-Emulator">[...]</a>

Motivation behind the project Nowadays students have become smart enough that they can bring their mobile phones to the exams hall where they are strictly not allowed to use mobiles. Sometimes teachers can find phones but when there is a large number of students it is hard to check every student manually. This mobile phone detector can easily detect any RF transmitting device.
