<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1816, o astrofísico e espectroscopista norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Morris_Rutherfurd">Lewis Morris Rutherfurd</a>. Ele fez os primeiros telescópios concebidos para fotografia celestial. Produziu um esquema de classificação de estrelas baseado nos seus espectros, tal como desenvolvido de forma semelhante pelo astrónomo italiano. Rutherfurd passou a sua vida a trabalhar no seu próprio observatório, construído em 1856, onde fotografou (desde 1858) a Lua, Júpiter, Saturno, o Sol, e estrelas até à quinta magnitude. Ao utilizar a fotografia para mapear aglomerados de estrelas, concebeu um novo micrómetro para medir distâncias entre estrelas com maior precisão. Quando Rutherford iniciou (1862) os estudos espectroscópicos, concebeu grelhas de difracção altamente sofisticadas.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1835, o industrial e filantropo norte-americano nascido na Escócia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Carnegie">Andrew Carnegie</a>. Ele iniciou a sua carreira no negócio do ferro e do aço em 1865, focalizado no aço a partir de 1873, foi proprietário da Homestead Steel Works em 1888, e em 1899 tinha fundado a Carnegie Steel Co., que se fundiu com a United States Steel Corp. em 1901. Dedicou então o resto da sua vida à filantropia, especialmente como benfeitor de mais de 1700 bibliotecas. Também apoiou a educação pública, e a paz internacional. Os seus pais eram tecelões em teares manuais na Escócia, tornados pobres pelo advento de fábricas mecanizadas, e a família emigrou para Pittsburgh, Pensilvânia, EUA, em 1848. Aos 17 anos, tornou-se operador telegráfico, e em 1859 foi vice-presidente da Pennsylvania Railroad.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1844, o engenheiro mecânico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Benz">Karl Benz</a>. Ele concebeu e construiu o primeiro automóvel prático do mundo a ser movido por um motor de combustão interna. O primeiro motor que construiu foi um motor de dois tempos, que após dois anos de trabalho, funcionou pela primeira vez a 31 de Dezembro de 1879. Obteve várias patentes sobre esta máquina, e abriu uma fábrica. Depois de desenvolver apoio financeiro, Benz concebeu uma "carruagem motorizada", com um motor baseado no ciclo Otto a quatro tempos. Ao contrário de Daimler, que instalou o seu motor num carro normal, Benz concebeu não só o seu motor, mas também inovou o veículo. A 29 de Janeiro de 1886, foi-lhe concedida uma patente sobre o mesmo e a 3 de Julho de 1886, fez o primeiro test-drive automóvel público do mundo. A venda pública começou em 1888.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou a nave espacial DART foi lançada para o espaço. Trata-se da primeira missão à escala mundial para testar a tecnologia de defesa da Terra contra potenciais perigos de asteróides ou cometas. Apenas uma parte da maior estratégia de defesa planetária da NASA, o DART - construído e gerido pelo Laboratório de Física Aplicada (APL) da Johns Hopkins em Laurel, Maryland - irá colidir com um asteróide conhecido que não é uma ameaça para a Terra. O seu objectivo é alterar ligeiramente o movimento do asteróide de uma forma que possa ser medida com precisão utilizando telescópios terrestres. DART mostrará que uma nave espacial pode navegar autonomamente para um asteróide alvo e colidir intencionalmente com ele - um método de deflexão chamado impacto cinético. O teste fornecerá dados importantes para ajudar a preparar melhor um asteróide que possa representar um risco de impacto para a Terra, caso venha a ser descoberto. LICIACube, um CubeSat montado com DART e fornecido pela Agência Espacial Italiana (ASI), será libertado antes do impacto do DART para capturar imagens do impacto e da nuvem resultante de matéria ejectada. Cerca de quatro anos após o impacto do DART, o projecto Hera da ESA (Agência Espacial Europeia) realizará levantamentos detalhados de ambos os asteróides, com particular enfoque na cratera deixada pela colisão do DART e uma determinação precisa da massa do Dimorphos. A nave irá interceptar o sistema Didymos entre 26 de Setembro e 1 de Outubro de 2022, colidindo intencionalmente contra Dimorphos a cerca de 6 quilómetros por segundo.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker assim como alguns videos interessantes. São apresentadas as revistas HackspaceMag Nº49 e a MagPi nº112 de Dezembro.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-spacex-launch-dart-first-test-mission-to-defend-planet-earth">NASA, SpaceX Launch DART: First Test Mission to Defend Planet Earth</a></h2>

<p><em>"NASA’s Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART), the world’s first full-scale mission to test technology for defending Earth against potential asteroid or comet hazards, launched Wednesday at 1:21 a.m. EST on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Space Launch Complex 4 East at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. Just one part of NASA’s larger planetary defense strategy, DART – built and managed by the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland – will impact a known asteroid that is not a threat to Earth. Its goal is to slightly change the asteroid’s motion in a way that can be accurately measured using ground-based telescopes. DART will show that a spacecraft can autonomously navigate to a target asteroid and intentionally collide with it – a method of deflection called kinetic impact. The test will provide important data to help better prepare for an asteroid that might pose an impact hazard to Earth, should one ever be discovered. LICIACube, a CubeSat riding with DART and provided by the Italian Space Agency (ASI), will be released prior to DART’s impact to capture images of the impact and the resulting cloud of ejected matter."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-spacex-launch-dart-first-test-mission-to-defend-planet-earth">[...]</a>

<p><em>"We believe our all-electric ‘Spirit of Innovation’ aircraft is the world’s fastest all-electric aircraft, setting three new world records. We have submitted data to the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) – the World Air Sports Federation who control and certify world aeronautical and astronautical records – that at 15:45 (GMT) on 16 November 2021, the aircraft reached a top speed of 555.9 km/h (345.4 mph) over 3 kilometres, smashing the existing record by 213.04 km/h (132mph). In further runs at the UK Ministry of Defence’s Boscombe Down experimental aircraft testing site, the aircraft achieved 532.1km/h (330 mph) over 15 kilometres – 292.8km/h (182mph) faster than the previous record – and broke the fastest time to climb to 3000 metres by 60 seconds with a time of 202 seconds, according to our data. We hope that the FAI will certify and officially confirm the achievements of the team in the near future. During its record-breaking runs, the aircraft clocked up a maximum speed of 623 km/h (387.4 mph) which we believe makes the ‘Spirit of Innovation’ the world’s fastest all-electric vehicle. Warren East, CEO, Rolls-Royce, said: “Staking the claim for the all-electric world-speed record is a fantastic achievement for the ACCEL team and Rolls-Royce."</em> <a href="https://www.rolls-royce.com/media/press-releases/2021/19-11-2021-spirit-of-innovation-stakes-claim-to-be-the-worlds-fastest-all-electric-vehicle.aspx">[...]</a>

The close approach (known as perihelion), also at a record distance, occurred at 4:25 a.m. EST (8:25 UTC), with Parker Solar Probe moving 364,660 miles per hour (586,864 kilometers per hour). The milestone also marked the midway point in the mission’s 10th solar encounter, which began Nov. 16 and continues through Nov. 26. The spacecraft entered the encounter in good health, with all systems operating normally. Parker Solar Probe is scheduled to check back in with mission operators at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland – where it was also designed and built – on Nov 24. The spacecraft will transmit science data from the encounter – largely covering the properties and structure of the solar wind as well as the dust environment near the Sun – back to Earth from Dec. 23-Jan."</em> <a href="http://parkersolarprobe.jhuapl.edu/News-Center/Show-Article.php?articleID=172">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scientists have developed new materials for next-generation electronics so tiny that they are not only indistinguishable when closely packed, but they also don’t reflect enough light to show fine details, such as colors, with even the most powerful optical microscopes. Under an optical microscope, carbon nanotubes, for example, look grayish. The inability to distinguish fine details and differences between individual pieces of nanomaterials makes it hard for scientists to study their unique properties and discover ways to perfect them for industrial use. In a new report in Nature Communications, researchers from UC Riverside describe a revolutionary imaging technology that compresses lamp light into a nanometer-sized spot. It holds that light at the end of a silver nanowire like a Hogwarts student practicing the “Lumos” spell, and uses it to reveal previously invisible details, including colors. The advance, improving color-imaging resolution to an unprecedented 6 nanometer level, will help scientists see nanomaterials in enough detail to make them more useful in electronics and other applications."</em> <a href="https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2021/11/23/magic-wand-reveals-colorful-nano-world">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Berkeley Lab study shows how battery-electric trains can deliver environmental justice, cost-savings, and resilience to the U.S. Trains have been on the sidelines of electrification efforts for a long time in the U.S. because they account for only 2% of transportation sector emissions, but diesel freight trains emit 35 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually and produce air pollution that leads to $6.5 billion in health costs, resulting in an estimated 1,000 premature deaths each year. What’s more, these deaths and adverse health impacts disproportionately affect disadvantaged and low-income communities, which are more likely to be located near freight rail yards and railways. The recent dramatic decline in battery prices has created a new possibility for electrification of freight trains. Researchers from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), collaborating with UCLA and UC Berkeley researchers, make the case that the U.S. can retrofit diesel-electric trains with batteries in a way that is cost-competitive with diesel. Doing so would avoid these unnecessary deaths and health impacts and save the U.S. freight rail sector $94 billion over 20 years from reduced air pollution and carbon dioxide emissions."</em> <a href="https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2021/11/23/big-batteries-on-wheels-can-deliver-zero-emissions-rail-while-securing-the-grid/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"New approach solves a persistent problem of intermittency that has hindered use of the tiny light emitters for biological imaging or quantum photonics. Quantum dots, discovered in the 1990s, have a wide range of applications and are perhaps best known for producing vivid colors in some high-end televisions. But for some potential uses, such as tracking biochemical pathways of a drug as it interacts with living cells, progress has been hampered by one seemingly uncontrollable characteristic: a tendency to blink off at random intervals. That doesn’t matter when the dots are used in the aggregate, as in TV screens, but for precision applications it can be a significant drawback. Now, a team of chemists at MIT has come up with a way to control this unwanted blinking without requiring any modification to the formulation or the manufacturing process. By firing a beam of mid-infrared laser light for an infinitesimal moment — a few trillionths of a second — the quantum dot’s blinking is eliminated for a relatively long period, tens of billions of times longer than the laser pulse."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/quantum-dots-blinking-1122">[...]</a>

The next generation of photonic technologies, such as photonic quantum networks and computers, will require even more control over the properties of a photon. One of the hardest properties to change is a photon’s color, otherwise known as its frequency, because changing the frequency of a photon means changing its energy. Today, most frequency shifters are either too inefficient, losing a lot of light in the conversion process, or they can’t convert light in the gigahertz range, which is where the most important frequencies for communications, computing, and other applications are found. Now, researchers from the Harvard John A.

You can write the melody yourself or find a ready-made one on the musicboxmaniacs website. If you use a ready-made melody, then first you need to remove polyphony from it - this means that there should not be more than one note in one musical measure. After that, transfer it manually in the following order: the lowest note has a value of 0, and so on up to the highest."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Robot-Plays-Music-on-Wine-Glasses/">[...]</a>

The idea is to have a small easily transportable record player where the record remains stationary and the player spins, the music is then transmitted to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones via the built in Bluetooth transmitter. For now it is in it's most basic form as I just wanted to test the concept but moving forward I want to keep this an open source project that people can make and alter to their needs. It is for now very much still a work in progress as I try and perfect it, but I would love if the Instructable community joins me on this journey. In its current state the drive system along with the Bluetooth transmitting is working flawlessly I just need to perfect the tonearm design without sacrificing portability. Join me on the journey I've taken so far... To make your own you will need the following: - Access to a 3D printer - 5V DC motor with worm gearbox - Ceramic record player cartridge - USB Bluetooth audio transmitter - Arduino Nano or smaller - H-Bridge motor driver - *Arduino and motor driver can be replaced by a PWM motor speed controller."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Building-a-Portable-Bluetooth-Spinning-Record-Play/">[...]</a>
