<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1871, o químico francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Grignard">Victor Grignard</a>. Ele recebeu o Prémio Nobel de Química em 1912, pelo seu desenvolvimento da reacção de Grignard. Ele descobriu os halogenetos de alquilmagnésio (1901), que são preparados pela reacção de magnésio com um halogeneto orgânico em éter seco, produzindo compostos do tipo RMgX, onde X é um halogéneo (Cl, Br, I) e R um grupo orgânico. Esses reagentes de Grignard são extremamente importantes em sínteses orgânicas. Eles são muito versáteis e permitem a síntese de um grande número de diferentes classes de compostos, particularmente álcoois secundários e terciários, hidrocarbonetos e ácidos carboxílicos facilitam uma série de reacções químicas e Grignard passou grande parte de sua vida a trabalhar neles.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1872, o Matemático, astrónomo e cosmólogo holandês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willem_de_Sitter">Willem de Sitter</a>. Ele desenvolveu modelos teóricos do universo com base na teoria geral da relatividade de Albert Einstein. Ele trabalhou extensivamente nos movimentos dos satélites de Júpiter, determinando as suas massas e órbitas a partir de décadas de observações. Ele determinou as constantes fundamentais da astronomia e determinou a variação da rotação da Terra. Ele também realizou estudos estatísticos da distribuição e do movimento das estrelas, mas hoje é mais conhecido pelas suas contribuições à cosmologia. A sua solução de 1917 para as equações de campo de Albert Einstein mostrou que um universo quase vazio se expandiria. Mais tarde, ele e Einstein encontraram uma solução para o universo em expansão sem curvatura espacial.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1908, o físico canadiano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Allen">John F. Allen</a>. Ele co-descobriu a super-fluidez do hélio líquido perto da temperatura de zero absoluto. Trabalhando no Royal Society Mond Laboratory em Cambridge, com Don Misener, ele descobriu (1930) que abaixo da temperatura de 2,17 kelvin, o hélio líquido poderia fluir através de capilares muito pequenos com viscosidade praticamente zero. Independentemente, P. L. Kapitza em Moscovo produziu resultados semelhantes quase ao mesmo tempo. OS seus dois artigos foram publicados juntos na edição de 8 de Janeiro de 1938 da revista Nature. A super-fluidez é uma manifestação visível resultante da mecânica quântica da condensação de Bose-Einstein. Em 1945, a pesquisa em Moscovo mergulhou no aspecto microscópico, que Allen não investigou.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1916, o Físico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_H._Dicke">Robert H. Dicke</a>. Ele trabalhou em campos tão amplos como física de micro-ondas, cosmologia e relatividade. Como teórico inspirado e experimentalista de sucesso, o seu tema unificador foi a aplicação de métodos experimentais poderosos e escrupulosamente controlados a questões que realmente importam. Ele também fez uma série de contribuições significativas para a tecnologia de radar e para o campo da física atómica. A sua visualização de um universo oscilante estimulou a descoberta da radiação cósmica de fundo em micro-ondas, a evidência mais directa de que nosso universo realmente se expandiu de um estado denso. Um instrumento-chave nas medições deste fóssil do Big Bang é o radiómetro de micro-ondas que ele inventou. As suas patentes variavam de secadores de roupas a laseres.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1929, o químico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Lauterbur">Paul Lauterbur</a>. Ele partilhou (com Sir Peter Mansfield) o Prémio Nobel de Fisiologia ou Medicina de 2003 "pelas suas descobertas sobre imagens de ressonância magnética".</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou a SpaceX lançou o foguetão Starship SN15, o quinto da sua família, num voo de teste que o elevou a uma altitude de 10 Km e que permitiu, desta vez com sucesso, aterrar o mesmo. O lançamento ocorreu no 60º aniversário do primeiro voo sub-orbital norte-americano tripulado. O SN15 de aço inoxidável ("Serial No. 15") descolou do local de teste Starbase da SpaceX, perto da vila de Boca Chica no sul do Texas, às 18h24. EST (22:24 GMT) da passada quarta-feira. O veículo subiu cerca de 10 quilómetros no céu, realizou uma série de manobras e desceu para um toque seguro na sua área de pouso de betão designada, seis minutos após a descolagem. A SpaceX está a desenvolver a Starship para levar pessoas e cargas à Lua, Marte e outros destinos distantes. O sistema consiste em dois elementos, ambos projectados para serem total e rapidamente reutilizáveis: uma nave espacial chamada Starship e um impulsionador gigante de primeiro estágio chamado Super Heavy.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou a IBM anunciou o desenvolvimento do primeiro chip do mundo com tecnologia de 2 nm. A exigência por maior desempenho e eficiência energética dos chips continua a crescer, especialmente na era da "cloud" híbrida, IA e IoT. A nova tecnologia de chip de 2 nm da IBM ajuda a avançar o estado da arte na indústria de semicondutores, atendendo a essa necessidade crescente. O Chip foi projectado para atingir um desempenho 45% maior e um consumo de energia 75% menor do que os chips de 7 nm mais avançados de hoje.</p>

<p>Hoje a Newsletter faz seis anos! Sempre, de forma, ininterrupta tenho trazido aqui a esta audiência noticias e projectos do que acontece em todo o mundo. Ao longo destes 6 anos já foram publicados mais de dez mil projectos, quase oito mil noticias e perto de setecentos EBooks e Revistas.</p>

<p>Nesta 314º Newsletter faço uma reflexão sobre o ultimo ano que foi bastante animado em termos do mundo voltar a olhar para a exploração espacial como forma de expandir-mos o conhecimento do mundo que nos rodeia e de podermos concretizar desafios ainda maiores que os que nos levaram na 1ª corrida ao espaço. A chegada de inúmeros veículos de exploração espacial a Marte é disso um reflexo. Também a intenção, em alguns casos já concretizada, de voltar à Lua é disso uma realidade.
Também neste ultimo ano e meio vivemos envoltos numa pandemia que nos fez pensar e quebrar certos dogmas e dados adquiridos que tínhamos, como a liberdade (que por diversas alturas nos foi condicionada), a disponibilidade de bens essenciais (com a existência de quotas para se entrar em lojas e supermercados), o trabalho que desapareceu e que afectou uma parte significativa da nossa sociedade.</p>

<p>Sinto no entanto que vivemos tempos de alguma esperança, esperança de que as coisas melhorem, seja por ultrapassarmos esta situação pandémica, seja por estarmos mais conscientes de que os recursos do planeta não são ilimitados e que cabe a todos termos um papel activo na defesa e preservação do mesmo. A utilização de energias renováveis e o cada vez menor recurso a combustíveis fosseis nas nossas deslocações (seja por uso de veículos eléctricos ou de veículos sem motor) é outra das evoluções que se tem observado.</p>

<p>Haja esperança!</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker assim como alguns videos interessantes. É apresentado o livro "Computer Science from the Bottom Up".</p>

<p><em>""Landing nominal," Elon Musk says. The private spaceflight company's latest Starship prototype aced a high-altitude test flight today (May 5), checking every box from takeoff to touchdown for the first time. "We are down! The Starship has landed," John Insprucker, SpaceX's principal integration engineer, said during live commentary. Today's uncrewed test came on the 60th anniversary of the United States' first-ever crewed spaceflight, the suborbital jaunt of NASA astronaut Alan Shepard. The historical parallel is coincidental but appropriate, for SN15's success marks a big step forward in SpaceX's plans to help extend humanity's footprint out into the final frontier."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-starship-sn15-launch-landing-success">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The Roc stayed aloft for 3 hours and 14 minutes today (April 29). The biggest airplane ever built now has two flights under its belt. Stratolaunch's Roc carrier plane, which is being groomed to haul hypersonic vehicles aloft, conducted its second-ever test flight Thursday morning (April 29). The giant aircraft, which features a wingspan of 385 feet (117 meters), took off from Mojave Air and Space Port in southeastern California at 10:28 a.m. EDT (1428 GMT; 7:28 local California time) on a data-gathering shakeout cruise that lasted three hours and 14 minutes. Roc reached a maximum altitude of 14,000 feet (4,267 m) and a top speed of 199 mph (320 kph) during Thursday's test flight, which Stratolaunch deemed a success. "We're very pleased with how the Stratolaunch aircraft performed today, and we are equally excited about how much closer the aircraft is to launching its first hypersonic vehicle," Stratolaunch chief operating officer Zachary Krevor said during a postflight news conference today."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/stratolaunch-worlds-largest-airplane-roc-2nd-test-flight">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In an international collaboration, researchers at the University of Stuttgart were able to detect quantum bits in two-dimensional materials for the first time. Nature Materials covers this in its May 6, 2021 issue. Quantum computers or quantum sensors consist of materials that are completely different to their classic predecessors. These materials are faced with the challenge of combining contradicting properties that quantum technologies entail, as for example good accessibility of quantum bits with maximum shielding from environmental influences. In this regard, so-called two-dimensional materials, which only consist of a single layer of atoms, are particularly promising. Researchers at the new Center for Applied Quantum Technologies and the 3rd Institute of Physics at the University of Stuttgart have now succeeded in identifying promising quantum bits in these materials."</em> <a href="https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/university/news/news/New-boost-in-quantum-technologies/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In spintronics, the magnetic moment of electrons (spin) is used to transfer and manipulate information. An ultra-compact 2D spin-logic circuitry could be built from 2D materials that can transport the spin information over long distances and also provide strong spin-polarization of charge current. Experiments by physicists at the University of Groningen (The Netherlands) and Colombia University (USA) suggest that magnetic graphene can be the ultimate choice for these 2D spin-logic devices as it efficiently converts charge to spin current and can transfer this strong spin-polarization over long distances. This discovery was published on 6 May in Nature Nanotechnology. Spintronic devices are promising high-speed and energy-saving alternatives for the current electronics. These devices use magnetic moment of electrons so-called spins (‘up’ or ‘down’) to transfer and store information."</em> <a href="https://www.rug.nl/sciencelinx/nieuws/2021/05/towards-2d-memory-technology-by-magnetic-graphene">[...]</a>

Researchers named the vulnerability SPECTRE because the flaw was built into modern computer processors that get their speed from a technique called “speculative execution,” in which the processor predicts instructions it might end up executing and preps by following the predicted path to pull the instructions from memory. A Spectre attack tricks the processor into executing instructions along the wrong path. Even though the processor recovers and correctly completes its task, hackers can access confidential data while the processor is heading the wrong way. Since Spectre was discovered, the world’s most talented computer scientists from industry and academia have worked on software patches and hardware defenses, confident they’ve been able to protect the most vulnerable points in the speculative execution process without slowing down computing speeds too much.

Straight-line constant-speed propagation in free space is a basic characteristic of light. In a recent study published in Communications Physics, researchers from Osaka University discovered the phenomenon of reciprocating propagation of laser pulse intensity in free space. Spatiotemporal couplings have been recently used to produce light with tunable group-velocity, direction, and trajectory in free space. For example, the flying focus (a moving laser pulse intensity in the extended Rayleigh length), where longitudinal chromatism and temporal chirp are combined to control the spectrum-dependent focus-separation in space and spectrum-dependent pulse-location in time, respectively, has arbitrarily tunable propagating group-velocity and direction in space and time. However, in the previous result, the flying focus can only propagate along a certain direction either forward or backward, although the propagating group-velocity can be freely controlled."</em> <a href="https://scitechdaily.com/laser-light-makes-a-comeback-literally-new-phenomenon-discovered/">[...]</a>

For this purpose I reviewed the datasheets for most chips on the board and it is seen that the supply voltage should be 5V. It was easiest and safest to solder the power cords directly to pin 4 (Gnd) and pin 6 (Vcc) of MC 34063 chip. After connecting the power supply, the basic information appears on the display, and we are most interested in Baud Rate, who in this case is 4800.
