<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1452, o pintor, escultor, arquitecto e engenheiro italiano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a>. Ele foi um grande engenheiro e inventor que projectou edifícios, pontes, canais, fortes e máquinas de guerra. Ele mantinha cadernos enormes com esboços das suas ideias. Entre eles, ele era fascinado por pássaros e voar e seus esboços incluem desenhos fantásticos como máquinas voadoras. Estes desenhos demonstram um génio para a invenção mecânica e compreensão da investigação científica, realmente séculos à frente do seu tempo. A sua fama está em ser um dos maiores pintores de todos os tempos, mais conhecido por pinturas como a Mona Lisa e A Última Ceia.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1707, o matemático e físico suíço <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler">Leonhard Euler</a>. Ele foi um dos fundadores da matemática pura. Ele não só fez contribuições decisivas e formativas para as disciplinas de geometria, cálculo, mecânica e teoria dos números, mas também desenvolveu métodos para resolver problemas em astronomia observacional e demonstrou aplicações úteis da matemática na tecnologia. Aos 28 anos, ele cegou um olho ao olhar para o sol enquanto tentava inventar uma nova forma de medir o tempo.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1874, o físico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Stark">Johannes Stark</a>. Ele ganhou o Prémio Nobel de Física de 1919 pela sua descoberta em 1913 de que um campo eléctrico causaria a divisão das linhas no espectro de luz emitido por uma substância luminosa; o fenómeno é chamado de efeito Stark.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1885, o físico americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emory_Leon_Chaffee">Emory Leon Chaffee</a>. Ele é responsável pela invenção do método do tipo faísca “Chaffee Gap” para produzir oscilações eléctricas de alta frequência contínuas para transmissão de rádio foi o resultado de um trabalho de pesquisa para sua tese de doutoramento. O centelhador ficava entre as faces finais das hastes de metal (um ânodo de cobre e um cátodo de alumínio), numa atmosfera de hidrogénio húmido numa câmara selada. Ele também se especializou na área de tubos de vácuo termiônicos e medições de teste, como uma determinação directa precisa do valor de e / m, a razão da carga do electrão e sua massa. Mais tarde, ele interessou-se pelo olho, fazendo um trabalho experimental com William T. Bovie sobre a resposta eléctrica da retina, que Chaffee amplificou com um circuito de tubo a vácuo.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1896, o químico russo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolay_Semyonov">Nikolay Nikolayevich Semyonov</a>. Ele partilhou o Prémio Nobel de Química em 1956 com Sir Cyril Hinshelwood por "suas pesquisas sobre o mecanismo de reacções químicas". Ele foi o primeiro cientista soviético a receber o Prémio Nobel. Em 1926, com seus colegas de trabalho, Semyonov descobriu pela primeira vez as reacções de cadeia ramificada na oxidação do fósforo. Considerando que sua intenção para a investigação começou como um estudo da produção de luz daquela reacção, ele ficou surpreso ao descobrir que há uma pressão crítica de gás oxigénio abaixo da qual nenhuma actividade ocorreria. As explicações teóricas que ele desenvolveu sobre como um processo pode ser iniciado por um mecanismo em cadeia também são aplicáveis numa ampla gama de reacções químicas, incluindo oxidação, craqueamento, halogenação, polimerização e explosões. O mecanismo de cadeia cria uma avalanche de interacções.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1927, o físico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mills_(physicist)">Robert L. Mills</a>. Ele partilhou o Prémio Rumford Premium em 1980 com seu colega Chen Ning Yang por seu "desenvolvimento de uma teoria de campo invariante de calibre generalizado" em 1954. Eles propuseram uma equação tensorial para o que agora são chamados de campos de Yang-Mills. O seu trabalho matemático teve como objectivo compreender a forte interacção que mantém os núcleos unidos nos núcleos atómicos. Eles construíram uma visão mais generalizada do electromagnetismo, portanto, as Equações de Maxwell podem ser derivadas como um caso especial de sua equação tensorial. A teoria Quantum Yang-Mills é agora a base da maioria da teoria das partículas elementares, e suas previsões foram testadas em muitos laboratórios experimentais.</p>

<p>Faz hoje anos que, em 1912, o navio <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic">R.M.S. Titanic</a> se afundava quatro horas depois de colidir contra um icebergue. Estava na sua viagem inaugural no oceano Atlântico Norte, quatro dias fora de Southampton, Inglaterra, a caminho da cidade de Nova York, EUA. De uma estimativa de 2.224 pessoas a bordo, 1.517 morreram. Apenas 866 foram resgatados pelo Carpathia quando este chegou à área ao amanhecer. Cerca de duas em cada três pessoas morreram na água gelada. O navio carregava um número insuficiente de botes salva-vidas. O navio tinha uns impressionantes 269 metros de comprimento e tinha 28 metros de largura.</p>

<p><em>"Neuralink is developing a fully-implanted, wireless, high-channel count brain-machine interface (BMI) with the goal of enabling people with paralysis to directly use their neural activity to operate computers and mobile devices with speed and ease. In a 2019 white paper, we outlined the design of our novel electrodes and our unique surgical approach, along with preliminary electrophysiology obtained in a rodent model. That generation of the Link had wired leads and a connector that protruded through the skin, and was an important platform for developing and validating our robotic surgical approach and our ultra low-power custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for amplifying and processing neural signals. In 2020, we publicly shared a wireless version of the Link that was able to stream 1,024 channels of action potentials (also called “spikes”) wirelessly and in real time (Fig. 1). We demonstrated its functionality by recording somatosensory (touch) signals in pigs exploring their environment."</em> <a href="https://neuralink.com/blog/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The Galaxy Upcycling program repurposes older smartphones into medical diagnosis cameras, helping underserved populations in Vietnam, India, Morocco and Papua New Guinea Samsung Electronics is repurposing older smartphones to enable greater access to ophthalmic health care in underserved communities around the world. Samsung partnered with the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness (IAPB) and Yonsei University Health System (YUHS) in Korea to create medical devices1 that screen for eye disease by upcycling Galaxy smartphones that are no longer of use. This Galaxy Upcycling program is helping to address approximately 1 billion global cases of vision impairment that are preventable with proper diagnosis. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), at least 2.2 billion people have a form of vision impairment and almost half of these cases were preventable or have yet to be addressed. There is a large disparity in the prevalence of vision impairment depending on the affordability and availability of eye care services. This is estimated to be four times more common in low- and middle-income regions as compared to high-income regions.2 “People around the globe face barriers to accessing fundamental health care, and we saw an opportunity to engineer smart, innovative solutions that reuse products to drive more sustainable practices and make a positive impact in our communities,” said Sung-Koo Kim, VP of Sustainability Management Office, Mobile Communications Business at Samsung Electronics."</em> <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsungs-eyelike-fundus-camera-repurposes-galaxy-smartphones-to-improve-access-to-eye-care">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4343.html">STMicroelectronics Introduces New MasterGaN4 Devices for High-Efficiency Power Conversion up to 200 Watts</a></h2>

<p><em>"The STMicroelectronics MasterGaN4* power packages integrate two symmetrical 650V gallium nitride (GaN) power transistors with 225mΩ RDS(on), alongside optimized gate drivers and circuit protection to simplify the design of high-efficiency power-conversion applications up to 200W. The latest addition to ST’s MasterGaN family, MasterGaN4 simplifies design using wide-bandgap GaN power semiconductors by taking away the complex gate-control and circuit-layout challenges. With inputs tolerant of voltages from 3.3V to 15V, MasterGaN4 can be controlled by connecting the packages directly to Hall-effect sensors or a CMOS device such as a microcontroller, DSP, or FPGA. Leveraging the higher operating frequencies enabled by the superior switching performance of GaN transistors, as well as their increased efficiency that reduces thermal dissipation, designers can choose small magnetic components and heatsinks to build more compact and lightweight power supplies, chargers, and adapters. MasterGaN4 is ideally suited to use in symmetrical half-bridge topologies as well as soft-switching topologies such as active clamp flyback and active clamp forward. The wide supply-voltage range, from 4.75V to 9.5V, allows convenient connection to an existing power rail."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4343.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"New RL78/G23 Optimized for IoT End Point Applications Expands Peripheral Functions and Security Functionality; Improves Power Consumption Renesas Electronics Corporation (TSE:6723), a premier supplier of advanced semiconductor solutions, today announced the launch and the beginning of mass production of its 16-bit general-purpose RL78/G23 microcontroller (MCU), further strengthening its RL78 Family of 8-bit and 16-bit MCUs for a broad range of applications. Compatible with Renesas' current general-purpose RL78 MCUs, such as the RL78/G13, the RL78/G23 increased the on-chip flash memory capacity to 768 KB and substantially expanded on-chip peripheral functions, which extend functionality while reducing the bill of materials (BOM) cost, while improving power consumption required by battery powered applications. With this feature combination, the new RL78/G23 is well suited for a wide range of applications that require both power and cost efficiency, including IoT endpoint devices such as home electronics, remote controls, and sensors. “It has been 10 years since we first introduced the RL78 Family, and as a leader of the extensive 16-bit MCU market, I am delighted that Renesas has continued its technology innovation drive as seen with the new RL78/G23, which delivers lower power consumption with a new process technology,” said Noriaki Nakanishi, Vice President of the MCU Device Solution Business Division at Renesas. “Moving forward, we will continue to expand the RL78 Family’s second-generation roadmap with easy to design and cost-efficient low-end MCUs to meet customers’ ever-evolving development needs.” By adopting a new process, the RL78/G23 realizes 44µA/MHz at CPU operation and 210nA during STOP (with 4KB of SRAM retention), an even lower power consumption compared to current RL78 MCUs. In addition, the newly implemented SNOOZE mode sequencer (SMS) makes it unnecessary to activate the CPU while any peripheral operations are operating in snooze mode, dramatically reducing power consumption for applications that utilize intermittent operation."</em> <a href="https://www.renesas.com/eu/en/about/press-room/renesas-strengthens-rl78-family-low-power-mcus-16-bit-general-purpose-rl78g23">[...]</a>

Viewed from near the orbital plane, each accretion disk takes on a characteristic double-humped look. But as one passes in front of the other, the gravity of the foreground black hole transforms its partner into a rapidly changing sequence of arcs. These distortions play out as light from both disks navigates the tangled fabric of space and time near the black holes. “We’re seeing two supermassive black holes, a larger one with 200 million solar masses and a smaller companion weighing half as much,” said Jeremy Schnittman, an astrophysicist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, who created the visualization."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2021/new-nasa-visualization-probes-the-light-bending-dance-of-binary-black-holes">[...]</a>

The scientist succeeded to induce the direct phase transition between three dimensional and two dimensional crystal structures in a lead-tin-selenide alloy semiconductor, which shows the abrupt band structure switch from a gap-less metallic state to a semiconducting state. The present result would lead to further functional property switching in semiconductors. The electronic properties of solid materials are highly dependent on crystal structures and their dimensionalities (i.e., whether the crystals have predominantly 2D or 3D structures). As Professor Takayoshi Katase of Tokyo Institute of Technology notes, this fact has an important corollary: "If the crystal structure dimensionality can be switched reversibly in the same material, a drastic property change may be controllable."

<p><em>"It’s an example of how surprising properties can spontaneously emerge in complex materials – a phenomenon scientists hope to harness for novel technologies. Creating a two-dimensional material, just a few atoms thick, is often an arduous process requiring sophisticated equipment. So scientists were surprised to see 2D puddles emerge inside a three-dimensional superconductor – a material that allows electrons to travel with 100% efficiency and zero resistance – with no prompting. Within those puddles, superconducting electrons acted as if they were confined inside an incredibly thin, sheet-like plane, a situation that requires them to somehow cross over to another dimension, where different rules of quantum physics apply. “This is a tantalizing example of emergent behavior, which is often difficult or impossible to replicate by trying to engineer it from scratch,” said Hari Manoharan, a professor at Stanford University and investigator with the Stanford Institute for Materials and Energy Sciences (SIMES) at the Department of Energy’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, who led the research. “It's as if when given the power to superconduct,” he said, “the 3D electrons choose for themselves to live in a 2D world.” The research team calls this new phenomenon "inter-dimensional superconductivity," and in a report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences today, they suggest that this is how 3D superconductors reorganize themselves just before undergoing an abrupt shift into an insulating state, where electrons are confined to their home atoms and can’t move around at all."</em> <a href="https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/news/2021-04-12-first-scientists-watch-2d-puddles-electrons-spontaneously-emerge-3d-superconducting">[...]</a>

The collaboration has developed superconducting versions of devices called qubits that will be able to detect the weak signals emitted by two kinds of hypothetical subatomic particles that could reside in an invisible but ubiquitous part of the universe called the dark sector. One is called an axion, a leading dark matter candidate. The other is called a hidden photon, a particle that possibly interacts with the photons — particles of light — of the visible universe. The technique now demonstrated by the Fermilab-University of Chicago team is 36 times more sensitive to the particles than the quantum limit, a benchmark of conventional quantum measurements, enabling searches for dark matter to proceed 1,000 times faster. Using light to detect dark particles In the technique, the qubits are designed to detect the photons that would be produced when dark matter particles interact with an electromagnetic field."</em> <a href="https://news.fnal.gov/2021/04/sensitive-qubit-based-technique-to-accelerate-search-for-dark-matter/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers have used a technique similar to MRI to follow the movement of individual atoms in real time as they cluster together to form two-dimensional materials, which are a single atomic layer thick. The results, reported in the journal Physical Review Letters, could be used to design new types of materials and quantum technology devices. The researchers, from the University of Cambridge, captured the movement of the atoms at speeds that are eight orders of magnitude too fast for conventional microscopes. Two-dimensional materials, such as graphene, have the potential to improve the performance of existing and new devices, due to their unique properties, such as outstanding conductivity and strength. Two-dimensional materials have a wide range of potential applications, from bio-sensing and drug delivery to quantum information and quantum computing. However, in order for two-dimensional materials to reach their full potential, their properties need to be fine-tuned through a controlled growth process."</em> <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/following-atoms-in-real-time-could-lead-to-better-materials-design">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Hankook's R&amp;D department has been working with biorobotics experts from Seoul National University and Harvard engineers on a weird transforming origami wheel project. These folding oddities can drastically alter their diameter and carry heavy loads. It's taken nearly a decade to get to this point, but the team has got a fully functioning set of transforming wheels built and attached them to a couple of demonstration vehicles, demonstrating that the wheels can vary their diameter from 46 to 80 cm (18.1 to 31.5 in), while supporting enough weight to put a full-size vehicle on top. The wheels are a three-layer construction based on a thick, flexible composite membrane designed to fold along similar lines to an origami waterbomb. To add structural strength and wear resistance, the non-folding panels are sandwiched with laser-cut aluminum facet panels, which hold most of the membrane rigid, with the exception of the fold lines. Left to their own devices, the wheels collapse to their minimum diameter, but squeezing them horizontally causes the wheels to fold up to their maximum diameter, where internal locking plates add extra rigidity to the structure."</em> <a href="https://newatlas.com/automotive/hankook-transforming-origami-wheels/">[...]</a>

A new partnership comprising Los Alamos National Laboratory, Advent Technology Holdings Inc., Brookhaven National Laboratory, and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) will work over the next few years to bring to market high-temperature proton exchange membrane (HT-PEM) fuel cells that convert hydrogen and other renewable fuels into electricity. “As the heavy-duty transportation industry seeks greener alternatives to combustion engines, HT-PEM fuel cells promise a clean, efficient alternative,” said Rod Borup, Los Alamos program manager for Fuel Cells and Vehicle Technology. Traditional PEM fuel cells have a relatively low operating temperature, which makes for a low tolerance to hydrogen fuel impurities and makes waste-heat rejection a challenge for vehicles. “This project hopes to change that, as well as contribute to the acceleration of energy and heavy-duty transportation technologies that will enable a clean, zero-emissions energy future,” said Borup."</em> <a href="https://www.lanl.gov/discover/news-release-archive/2021/April/0408-fuel-cell-technology.php">[...]</a>

Thus, I decided to develop some sort of autonomous system to handle the irrigation, and ideally, allow me to check and manage the whole system remotely. Since I didn't have a fixed design in mind, I knew from the beginning I wanted to approach this project in a very modular and iterative fashion, so as to gradually build up and refine the systems funcions.

They are called current probes and allow engineers to see and measure current waveforms in an oscilloscope up to tens or hundreds of amps. Without these devices, it would be very diffficult to work in the power applications field, but they are pricey, though. In fact, the starting price for one of these has surely prevented a lot of people to do it, specially in the hobbyist scene. There are a huge variety of current probes in the market, everyone built with a different approach in mind."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/ACS730-500kHz-Oscilloscope-Current-Probe/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Let me tell you about my dream, of an LED that automatically adjusts its brightness to match the ambient light, without any supporting components... It's no secret that I've been working on a new and updated version of my Precision Clock (but don't get too excited, it's still months away from release). One of the improvements is to the display, which will read out to the nearest millisecond, and the entire display has been redesigned so that it won't flicker when filmed with a high-speed camera. As far as I know, there are no off-the-shelf LED display drivers that can meet my specification. Pretty much every driver these days is serially addressed, and even the fastest ones top out at around 50MHz, which isn't fast enough for my needs. There just isn't demand for LED drivers that update with sub-millisecond precision."</em> <a href="https://mitxela.com/projects/automatic_led">[...]</a>
