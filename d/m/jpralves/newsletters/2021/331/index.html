<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1853, o químico físico russo-alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Ostwald">Wilhelm Ostwald</a>. Ele conseguiu quase sozinho organizar a química física num ramo quase independente da química. Ganhou o Prémio Nobel da Química em 1909 pelo seu trabalho sobre catálise, equilíbrio químico, e velocidades de reacção.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1877, o químico e físico inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Soddy">Frederick Soddy</a>. Ele recebeu o Prémio Nobel da Química em 1921 por investigar as substâncias radioactivas. Ele sugeriu que diferentes elementos produzidos em diferentes transformações radioactivas eram capazes de ocupar o mesmo lugar na Tabela Periódica, e a 18 de Fevereiro de 1913 ele nomeou tais espécies "isótopos" a partir de palavras gregas que significavam "mesmo lugar". Ele é creditado, juntamente com outros, com a descoberta do elemento protactinium em 1917.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1878, o matemático francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Ren%C3%A9_Fr%C3%A9chet">Maurice René Fréchet</a>. Ele ficou conhecido sobretudo pela sua contribuição para a análise real. É creditado por ser o fundador da teoria dos espaços abstractos, que generalizou a definição matemática tradicional do espaço como locus para a comparação de figuras; em termos de Fréchet, o espaço é definido como um conjunto de pontos e o conjunto de relações. Na sua dissertação de 1906, investigou os funcionais sobre um espaço métrico e formulou a noção abstracta de compacidade. Em 1907, descobriu um teorema de representação integral dos funcionais no espaço das funções integráveis quadráticas de Lebesgue. Também fez importantes contribuições para a estatística, probabilidade e cálculo.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1923, o matemático francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Thom">René Thom</a>. Ele recebeu a Medalha Fields em 1958 pelo seu trabalho em topologia, em particular em classes características, teoria do cobordismo e o teorema da transversalidade de Thom. Thom é também conhecido pelo seu trabalho posterior no desenvolvimento da teoria da catástrofe (1972), um tratamento matemático de acção contínua produzindo um resultado descontínuo. A teoria de Thom é uma tentativa de descrever, de uma forma que é impossível utilizando o cálculo diferencial, aquelas situações em que forças em mudança gradual conduzem às chamadas catástrofes, ou mudanças abruptas. A teoria tem aplicação generalizada nas ciências físicas e biológicas e nas ciências sociais, mas acabou por cair em desuso.</p>

<p>Em 1752 este foi o ultimo dia do calendário juliano para o império Britânico. Nesse ano, saltaram os dias 3 a 13 e adoptaram o calendário gregoriano. Onze dias foram saltados para adoptar o calendário gregoriano, concebido para realinhar o calendário com equinócios. Assim, o dia seguinte foi 14 de Setembro. Durante mais de um século e meio antes, na sequência do decreto do Papa Gregório XIII, Itália, e três outros países católicos (Espanha, Portugal e Polónia) utilizaram o calendário juliano pela última vez em 4 de Outubro de 1582. Seguiu-se a França, terminando a utilização do calendário juliano em 9 de Dezembro de 1582. A Rússia não mudou até ao início do século XX: 31 de Janeiro de 1918 foi a última data Juliana, seguida no dia seguinte por 14 de Fevereiro de 1918. Partes da China mudaram em 1912, mas a revolução comunista de 1949 estabeleceu a utilização do calendário gregoriano em toda a China.</p>

<p>Em 1969 abria a primeira caixa automática (ATM) da América, distribuindo dinheiro aos clientes no Chemical Bank em Rockville Centre, Nova Iorque. As caixas automáticas passaram a revolucionar a indústria bancária, eliminando a necessidade de visitar um banco para realizar transacções financeiras básicas. Na década de 1980, estas máquinas de dinheiro tinham-se tornado amplamente populares e lidavam com muitas das funções anteriormente desempenhadas por caixas humanos, tais como depósitos de cheques e transferências de dinheiro entre contas. Hoje em dia, as caixas automáticas são tão indispensáveis para a maioria das pessoas como os telemóveis e o correio electrónico.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou foi lançado o Linux Kernel 5.14. De entre as novidades destaca-se o suporte de agendamento de core, um novo controlador prioritário de I/O para gerir a prioridade dos pedidos de I/O do tipo block, um novo comando ioctl() para melhorar o journaling nos sistemas de ficheiros EXT4. Esta versão inclui ainda suporte total do kernel para o Raspberry Pi 400. Finalmente, há um esforço contínuo para adicionar suporte Linux para tecnologias emergentes e novas, incluindo USB 4, processador Intel 'Alder Lake', placas gráficas AMD Beige Goby &amp; Yellow Carp.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker assim como alguns videos interessantes.</p>

<p><em>"Announcing the latest kernel’s arrival on the Linux Kernel mailing list Linux founder Linus Torvalds couldn’t resist acknowledging the attention his ‘hobby’ project has received for its 30th anniversary recently, remarking: “I realize you must all still be busy with all the galas and fancy balls and all the other 30th anniversary events, but at some point you must be getting tired of the constant glitz, the fireworks, and the champagne. That ball gown or tailcoat isn’t the most comfortable thing, either. The celebrations will go on for a few more weeks yet, but you all may just need a breather from them.” Quite so, Linus! Quite so! So what goodies await us in this kernel uplift? Let’s take a look… Linux 5.14 New Features Linux 5.14 features (as always) an avalanche of improvements big and small, new capabilities, and enhanced hardware support."</em> <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2021/08/linux-kernel-5-14-new-features">[...]</a>

<p><em>"STMicroelectronics’ STDRIVEG600 half-bridge gate driver has high current output and 45ns propagation delay, closely matched between high-side and low-side outputs, to handle high-frequency switching of GaN enhancement-mode FETs. Also suitable for driving N-channel silicon MOSFETs at up to 20V, the STDRIVEG600 allows the flexibility to apply up to 6V gate-source voltage (VGS) on GaN devices to ensure low Rds(on). In addition, there is an integrated bootstrap circuit that helps minimize the bill of materials and simplify board layout. This circuit uses a synchronous MOSFET that lets the bootstrap voltage reach the logic supply voltage, VCC, allowing the driver to operate from a single supply without a low-dropout regulator (LDO). With dV/dt immunity of ±200V/ns, the STDRIVEG600 ensures dependable gate control in challenging electrical environments. The logic inputs are CMOS/TTL compatible down to 3.3V for easy interfacing with a host microcontroller or DSP."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4385.html">[...]</a>

The California Bay Area startup attempted its third orbital test flight today (Aug. 28), sending its two-stage Launch Vehicle 0006 skyward from the Pacific Spaceport Complex on Alaska's Kodiak Island at 6:35 p.m. EDT (2235 GMT). The rocket suffered an anomaly about 2.5 minutes after liftoff, however, and the flight was terminated. Something appeared to be wrong from the beginning, as Launch Vehicle 0006 lurched sideways at the moment of liftoff rather than rise smoothly off the pad. But the rocket recovered and soared high into the Alaska sky, reaching an altitude of about 20.5 miles (33 kilometers) before shutting down, according to real-time data Astra provided during a webcast of the launch. The mission was terminated right around "max q," the point when the mechanical stresses on a rocket are highest."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/astra-rocket-fails-reach-space-military-test-flight">[...]</a>

The aim is to both alleviate scaling problems and calculation errors stemming from system instability. There are two major hurdles on the road to quantum development and eventual quantum supremacy: scalability and stability. Quantum states are a fickle matter, so sensitive that they can decohere at the slightest provocation -- and a quantum system's sensitivity tends to increase with the presence of more qubits in a given system.

But renewable energy can’t be incorporated into power grids efficiently until there is a way to store it on a large scale. “Most forms of renewable energy are dependent on weather conditions, which results in large fluctuations in the power they supply,” says Danick Reynard, a PhD student at EPFL’s Laboratory of Physical and Analytical Electrochemistry (LEPA). “But power grids aren’t designed to manage these kinds of fluctuations.” Hydrogen, because it can supply energy consistently regardless of the weather, is now attracting growing attention."</em> <a href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/charging-stations-can-combine-hydrogen-production-/">[...]</a>

The shape has been highly regarded for its evolution as large enough to incubate an embryo, small enough to exit the body in the most efficient way, not roll away once laid, is structurally sound enough to bear weight and be the beginning of life for 10,500 species that have survived since the dinosaurs. The egg has been called the “perfect shape”. Analysis of all egg shapes used four geometric figures: sphere, ellipsoid, ovoid, and pyriform (conical), with a mathematical formula for the pyriform yet to be derived. To rectify this, researchers introduced an additional function into the ovoid formula, developing a mathematical model to fit a completely novel geometric shape characterized as the last stage in the evolution of the sphere-ellipsoid, which it is applicable to any egg geometry."</em> <a href="https://www.kent.ac.uk/news/science/29620/research-finally-reveals-ancient-universal-equation-for-the-shape-of-an-egg">[...]</a>

This has motivated scientists and engineers to develop sources for entangled photons that can be integrated into nano-scale photonic circuits. Practical application of nanoscale devices requires a high photon-pair generation rate, room-temperature operation, and entangled photons emitted at telecommunications wavelengths in a directional manner. The most common way to create entangled photons is by a process known as Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion (SPDC) which involves a single photon being split into two entangled photons of lower frequencies, known as the signal and idler. Conventional approaches for SPDC rely on bulky devices that are up to several centimeters in length and are not optimal for photonic circuit integration. Conversely, at the nanoscale, the efficiency of the SPDC process is hindered by the small volume of the resonators, and the directionality of the emitted photons is challenging to control."</em> <a href="https://spie.org/news/generating-entangled-photons-with-nonlinear-metasurfaces">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Summary Researchers have developed a general quantum algorithm that can directly calculate the energy difference of an atom and molecule using a quantum computer. By avoiding the need to calculate the total molecular energies, the general algorithm is expected to be applied not only to quantum chemical calculations but also to various physical and mathematical problems, which are intractable with nowadays classical computers. Research outline OSAKA, Japan. As newly reported by the journal Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics, researchers from the Graduate School of Science at Osaka City University have developed a quantum algorithm that can understand the electronic states of atomic or molecular systems by directly calculating the energy difference in their relevant states. Implemented as a Bayesian phase different estimation, the algorithm breaks from convention by not focusing on the difference in total energies calculated from the pre- and post-phase evolution, but by following the evolution of the energy difference itself. “Almost all chemistry problems discuss the energy difference, not the total energy of the molecule itself,” says research lead and Specially-Appointed Lecturer Kenji Sugisaki, “also, molecules with heavy atoms that appear at the lower part of the periodic table have large total energies, but the size of the energy difference discussed in chemistry, such as electronic excitation states and ionization energies, does not depend much on the size of the molecule.” This idea led Sugisaki and his team to implementing a quantum algorithm that directly calculates energy differences instead of total energies, creating a future where scalable or practical quantum computers enable us to carry out actual chemical research and materials development."</em> <a href="https://www.osaka-cu.ac.jp/en/news/2021/new-bayesian-quantum-algorithm-directly-calculates-the-energy-difference-of-an-atom-and-molecule">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Brown dwarfs aren’t quite stars and aren’t quite planets, and a new study suggests there might be more of them lurking in our galaxy than scientists previously thought. A new study offers a tantalizing explanation for how a peculiar cosmic object called WISEA J153429.75-104303.3 – nicknamed “The Accident” – came to be. The Accident is a brown dwarf. Though they form like stars, these objects don’t have enough mass to kickstart nuclear fusion, the process that causes stars to shine. And while brown dwarfs sometimes defy characterization, astronomers have a good grasp on their general characteristics. Or they did, until they found this one."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/an-accidental-discovery-hints-at-a-hidden-population-of-cosmic-objects">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Oregon State University researchers have developed a secure computation protocol that’s 25% more efficient than what had been thought the best possible, meaning future savings in time and energy costs for groups needing to team up on computations while keeping their individual data private. Mike Rosulek, associate professor of computer science in the OSU College of Engineering, and graduate student Lance Roy presented their findings at this month’s virtual 41st annual International Cryptology Conference, or Crytpo 2021. The conference is organized by the International Association for Cryptologic Research. Roy, a 22-year-old who grew up in Corvallis, entered Oregon State’s computer science Ph.D. program at 18, going directly from homeschool high school to the OSU Graduate School. He had begun auditing undergraduate courses at OSU at age 12. Secure computation is often explained via “Yao’s millionaire problem,” a hypothetical situation developed by and named after computer scientist and computational theorist Andrew Yao in which two wealthy people want to determine who is richer but neither wants to reveal to the other how much money she/he has."</em> <a href="https://today.oregonstate.edu/news/osu-cryptography-research-leads-huge-efficiency-gain-secure-computing">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Wide Area Networks (WANs), the global backbones and workhorses of today’s Internet that connect billions of computers over continents and oceans, are the foundation of modern online services. As COVID-19 has placed a vital reliance on online services, today's networks are struggling to deliver high bandwidth and availability imposed by emerging workloads related to machine learning, video calls, and health care. To connect WANs over hundreds of miles, fiber optic cables that transmit data using light are threaded throughout our neighborhoods, made of incredibly thin strands of glass or plastic known as optical fibers. While they’re extremely fast, they’re not always reliable: they can easily break from weather, thunder storms, accidents, and even animals. These tears can cause severe and expensive damage, resulting in 911 service outages, lost connectivity to the Internet, and inability to use smartphone apps. Scientists from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) recently came up with a way to preserve the network when the fiber is down and reduce cost."</em> <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/news/who-can-bend-light-cheaper-internet">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The Wendelstein 7-X stellarator is an experimental nuclear fusion reactor designed to bring us closer to the prospect of clean, limitless energy, and since producing its first plasma in 2015 we've seen it take steady and significant steps toward that aim. Physicists have just confirmed another "major advance" that could see the reactor host plasma twice as hot as the Sun's core as a result of efforts to address inherent energy losses in the design. Stellarators stand apart from the more common, symmetrical doughnut-shaped tokamak fusion reactors as hugely complex structures full of twists and turns. As it is with all nuclear fusion reactors, the goal is to recreate the processes at play within the Sun, by subjecting streams of plasma to extreme temperature and pressure, forcing atoms to collide and fuse together to produce monumental amounts of energy. The Wendelstein 7-X reactor is so complex it required supercomputers to design. It uses a series of 50 superconductive magnetic coils to hold in place plasma as it loops around a twisting and turning circular chamber."</em> <a href="https://newatlas.com/energy/wendelstein-7-x-fusion-reactor-double-temperature-sun/">[...]</a>

In one of my previous videos, I showed you how to make such a detector with the help of the AS3935 sensor board which is specially designed for this purpose. This time I will show you how to make same such device, but now with a homemade detector circuit based on cheap AM Receiver IC TA7642. This design is many times cheaper, its sensitivity is much higher, and Also the resistance to local disturbances as various sparks from electrical devices is very high. The ingenious idea of using AM receiver IC as a detector is presented on elektronik-labor.de page under the name "The Franzis thunderstorm warner"."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/mircemk/sensitive-arduino-lightning-detector-with-homemade-sensor-7afaa5">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The project presented here is a dual AC to DC output linear power supply. This power supply provides low ripple low noise DC regulated output. Usually, transformer-based linear power supplies are considered very bulky and inefficient, but this power supply still is very important for sensitive applications such as analog circuits, communications devices, radio devices, audio circuits, OPAMP-based projects etc. "</em> <a href="https://www.electronics-lab.com/project/dual-5-v-5v-200-ma-regulated-linear-power-supply/">[...]</a>
