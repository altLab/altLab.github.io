<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1728, o matemático, astrónomo, físico e filósofo suíço-alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Heinrich_Lambert">Johann Heinrich Lambert</a>. Ele forneceu a primeira prova rigorosa de que pi é irracional (não pode ser expresso como o quociente de dois inteiros). Em 1766, Lambert escreveu Theorie der Parallellinien, um estudo sobre o postulado paralelo. Ao assumir que o postulado paralelo era falso, deduziu muitos resultados não-euclidianos. Ele notou que nesta nova geometria a soma dos ângulos de um triângulo aumenta à medida que a sua área diminui. Lambert conjecturou que e e p são transcendentais, embora isto não tenha sido provado durante mais um século. Ele é responsável por muitas inovações no estudo do calor e da luz, concebeu um método de medição da intensidade da luz, bem como trabalhou sobre a teoria da probabilidade.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1740, o inventor e balonista francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgolfier_brothers">Joseph-Michel Montgolfier</a>. Ele, com o seu irmão mais novo, Étienne, conduziu uma primeira experiência com um balão de tafetá cheio de fumo quente, foi presenteado com uma demonstração pública a 5 de Junho de 1783. Este trabalho pioneiro foi seguido por um voo com três animais como passageiros a 19 de Setembro de 1783, exibido em Paris e testemunhado pelo Rei Luís XVI. A 21 de Novembro de 1783, o seu balão transportou os dois primeiros homens num voo desamarrado. No espaço de um ano após o lançamento do seu balão de ensaio, os irmãos Montgolfier tinham permitido o primeiro voo tripulado de balão no mundo.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1743, o químico francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Lavoisier">Antoine Lavoisier</a>. Ele foi considerado o "pai da química moderna", foi um brilhante experimentador também activo nos assuntos públicos. Um aristocrata, investiu numa empresa privada contratada pelo governo para cobrar impostos. Com a sua riqueza, construiu um grande laboratório. Em 1778, descobriu que o ar consiste numa mistura de dois gases a que chamou oxigénio e azoto. Ao estudar o papel do oxigénio na combustão, substituiu a teoria do clogistão. Lavoisier descobriu também a lei da conservação da massa e concebeu o método moderno de nomeação de compostos, que substituiu o método antiquado não sistemático.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1873, o inventor americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_de_Forest">Lee de Forest</a>. Ele inventou o tubo de vácuo Audion, que tornou possível a transmissão de rádio ao vivo e se tornou o componente chave de todos os sistemas de rádio, telefone, radar, televisão e computador antes da invenção do transístor em 1947. Detinha 300 patentes.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1882, o físico germano-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Franck">James Franck</a>. Ele partilhou o Prémio Nobel da Física em 1925 com Gustav Hertz pela investigação sobre a excitação e ionização dos átomos por bombardeamento de electrões que verificou a natureza quantizada da transferência de energia.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1951, o Físico matemático norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Witten">Edward Witten</a>. Ele foi o primeiro físico a ser reconhecido com a Medalha Fields em 1990, pelos seus trabalhos com a teoria das supercordas, quando tinha 39 anos e no Institute for Advanced Study em Princeton, Nova Jersey. A Medalha Fields é considerada como tendo o estatuto de Prémio Nobel para matemáticos. Witten já era conhecido pelas suas contribuições na teoria elementar das partículas, especialmente na teoria quântica de campo e teoria das cordas, e pelas suas implicações matemáticas, quando em 1998 recebeu o Prémio Dannie Heineman de Física Matemática. Este prémio da Sociedade Física Americana foi atribuído por "avanços na elucidação da dinâmica do campo super-simétrico fortemente acoplado e das teorias das cordas", no qual explorou "as profundas consequências físicas e matemáticas da dualidade electro-magnética".</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou o Linux fez 30 anos. Passaram-se três décadas, desde que começou por ser um projecto académico de Linus Torvalds e hoje em dia é o sistema operativo mais usado no mundo. Usado em todo o tipo de dispositivos, desde os smartphones Android aos Servidores passando pelos Desktops. Tem os 100% dos TOP500 computadores mais potentes do mundo. De acordo com a Google o sistema é usado em mais de 3 mil milhões de dispositivos Android. De entre as suas façanhas, está presente e é essencial para o funcionamento da ISS e já voo em Marte para controlar o drone Ingenuity.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/08/25/linux_kernel_30_years_old/">Happy birthday, Linux: From a bedroom project to billions of devices in 30 years</a></h2>

<p><em>"Greg Kroah-Hartman talks to El Reg about world domination, what was, and what may be for the kernel On August 25, 1991, Linus Torvalds, then a student at the University of Helsinki in Finland, sent a message to the comp.os.minix newsgroup soliciting feature suggestions for a free Unix-like operating system he was developing as a hobby. Thirty years later, that software, now known as Linux, is everywhere. It dominates the supercomputer world, with 100 per cent market share. According to Google, the Linux kernel is at the heart of more than three billion active devices running Android, the most-used operating system in the world. Linux also powers the vast majority of web-facing servers Netcraft surveyed. It is even used more than Microsoft Windows on Microsoft's own Azure cloud."</em> <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/08/25/linux_kernel_30_years_old/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Without the global CFC ban we would already be facing the reality of a ‘scorched earth’, according to researchers measuring the impact of the Montreal Protocol. Their new evidence reveals the planet’s critical ability to absorb carbon from the atmosphere could have been massively degraded sending global temperatures soaring if we still used ozone-destroying chemicals such as CFCs. New modelling by the international team of scientists from the UK, USA and New Zealand, published today in Nature, paints a dramatic vision of a scorched planet Earth without the Montreal Protocol, what they call the “World Avoided”. This study draws a new stark link between two major environmental concerns – the hole in the ozone layer and global warming. The research team, led by a Lancaster University scientist, reveals that if ozone-destroying chemicals, which most notoriously include CFCs, had been left unchecked then their continued and increased use would have contributed to global air temperatures rising by an additional 2.5°C by the end of this century. Their findings, outlined in the paper ‘The Montreal Protocol protects the terrestrial carbon sink’, show that banning CFCs has protected the climate in two ways - curbing their greenhouse effect and, by protecting the ozone layer, shielding plants from damaging increases in ultraviolet radiation (UV)."</em> <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/news/scientists-reveal-how-landmark-cfc-ban-gave-planet-fighting-chance-against-global-warming">[...]</a>

Bulk materials can be difficult to study, so there is great interest in studying molecular compounds possessing metal-metal bonding, since such species can be more straightforwardly studied in detail and they constitute models that represent molecular fragments of bulk materials. Though metal-metal bonding is extremely well developed for transition metals and main group elements, which has served as the foundation of the above applications, it has remained virtually unknown for the actinide elements, with examples restricted to spectroscopically observed transients or fundamental diatomics in microscopic-scale trapping experiments.

Now, as reported in the journal Science, a team led by researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) and UC Berkeley has demonstrated an approach for achieving near 100% light-emission efficiency at all brightness levels. Their approach focuses on stretching or compressing a thin semiconductor film in a way that favorably changes its electronic structure. The team identified just how the semiconductor’s electronic structure dictated interaction among the energetic particles within the material. Those particles sometimes collide and annihilate each other, losing energy as heat instead of emitting light in the process."</em> <a href="https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2021/08/26/led-material-shines-under-strain/">[...]</a>

By replacing a complex hardware setup with simple hardware paired with optimized image processing, researchers from KAUST have developed a faster and more accurate three-dimensional (3D) particle-tracking system. Observing the 3D motion of particles in flow is important in studies of aerodynamics, fluid flow and molecular dynamics. Conventionally, this is performed using a complicated arrangement of multiple cameras, the images from which are analyzed and compared to reconstruct the motion of individual particles in 3D space over time. However, due to the complexity of the setup and the need for frequent and finicky calibration, such 3D particle velocimetry systems are often large, expensive and difficult to use.

To generate a random number, a circuit detects the random noise produced by a physical component, such as the thermal noise from diodes or resistors. However, the power consumption of these elements can be significant in highly integrated low-power applications, and the degree of randomness can degrade over time due to a change in the device’s physical and electronic characteristics.

These experiments — designed to study the properties of suspensions and solutions of colloids, macromolecules and polymers — have been established as key scientific drivers to many of the ongoing coherent light source upgrades occurring within the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The new mathematical methods, developed by the CAMERA team of Zixi Hu, Jeffrey Donatelli, and James Sethian, have the potential to reveal far more information about the function and properties of complex materials than was previously possible. Particles in a suspension undergo Brownian motion, jiggling around as they move (translate) and spin (rotate).

In these resonant states, electrons bounce back and forth between the two atomic planes in the 2-D interface at the same frequency. By characterizing these states, they found that twisting one of the graphene layers by 30 degrees relative to the other, instead of stacking the layers directly on top of each other, shifts the resonance to a lower energy. From this result, just published in Physical Review Letters, they deduced that the distance between the two layers increased significantly in the twisted configuration, compared to the stacked one. When this distance changes, so do the interlayer interactions, influencing how electrons move in the bilayer system. An understanding of this electron motion could inform the design of future quantum technologies for more powerful computing and more secure communication."</em> <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=119041">[...]</a>

Yet the slow diffusion of Mg ions inside the oxides poses a serious problem. To overcome this, some researchers have explored sulfur-based materials.

By integrating a light-emitting electrochemical cell with a resistive random-access memory that are both based on perovskite, the team achieved parallel and synchronous reading of data both electrically and optically in a ‘light-emitting memory.’ At the most fundamental level, digital data is stored as a basic unit of information known as a bit, which is often represented as either a one or a zero. Thus, the pursuit of better data storage comes down to finding more efficient ways to store and read these ones and zeros. While flash memory has become extremely popular, researchers have been searching for alternatives that could further improve speed and simplify fabrication. One candidate is nonvolatile resistive random-access memory, or RRAM.
