<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1713, o matemático, astrónomo e geofísico francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Clairaut">Alexis Clairaut</a>. Ele foi um newtoniano proeminente cujo trabalho ajudou a estabelecer a validade dos princípios e resultados que Sir Isaac Newton delineou nos Principia de 1687. Clairaut foi uma das figuras-chave na expedição à Lapónia que ajudou a confirmar a teoria de Newton para a figura da Terra. Nesse contexto, Clairaut elaborou um resultado matemático agora conhecido como "teorema de Clairaut". Ele também abordou o problema gravitacional dos três corpos, sendo o primeiro a obter um resultado satisfatório para a precessão absidal da órbita lunar. Em matemática, ele também é creditado com a equação de Clairaut e a relação de Clairaut.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1857, o médico, bacteriologista e matemático inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Ross">Ronald Ross</a>. Ele localizou o parasita da malária no intestino do mosquito Anopheles, identificando-o como o vector da doença. Por esta descoberta ele tornou-se o primeiro prémio Nobel britânico, quando recebeu o Prémio Nobel da Medicina em 1902. O seu estudo da malária começou em 1892. Em 1894, ele conduziu experiências na Índia para determinar a validade da hipótese de Alphonse Laveran e Patrick Manson de que os mosquitos espalham a doença. Demorou dois anos e meio de esforço antes que Ross conseguisse elucidar o ciclo de vida dos parasitas da malária nos mosquitos. Num trabalho posterior, na África Ocidental, ele também determinou a espécie de mosquito que carrega a mortal febre africana.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1865, o químico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Thiele_(chemist)">F. K. Johannes Thiele</a>. Ele pesquisou moléculas orgânicas não-saturadas conjugadas (envolvendo ligações simples e duplas alternadas ao longo de uma cadeia de carbono) seguidas por outros químicos, produzindo novas ideias para teorias sobre os mecanismos das reacções orgânicas. Ele estendeu a ideia (1865) de August Kekulé para a estrutura em anel do benzeno com uma hipótese de “valência parcial”, para a qual ele sugeriu uma estrutura de ressonância com ligações parciais representadas por um círculo tracejado desenhado dentro do anel de carbono (1899). Ele também estudou a química dos compostos de nitrogénio e descobriu muitos novos compostos e métodos de síntese. Ele investigou guanidina, hidrazina e seus derivados (alguns dos quais explosivos). Ele inventou o tubo Thiele para medir os pontos de fusão.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou os restos do foguetão Long March-5b, lançado no passado dia 5 de Maio, reentraram na atmosfera. A maior parte do foguetão foi destruída ao reentrar na atmosfera, mas o resto dos destroços caiu a oeste das Maldivas no oceano Indico, no passado domingo.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou o helicóptero marciano Ingenuity fez o seu quinto voo. Neste, o helicóptero dirigiu-se para o sul para apoiar pesquisas futuras sobre o uso potencial deste tipo de meio aéreo em Marte no futuro. O Ingenuity Mars Helicopter da NASA completou seu quinto voo no Planeta Vermelho com sua primeira viagem de ida do Wright Brothers Field para um campo de aviação a sul em 129 metros. Após a chegada acima de seu novo local, o Ingenuity alcançou um recorde de altitude de 10 metros e capturou imagens coloridas de alta resolução da sua nova vizinhança antes de pousar.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker assim como alguns videos interessantes. É apresentado a revista newelectronics de 11 de Maio.</p>

<p><em>"The remains of a Chinese rocket that was hurtling back towards Earth have crashed into the Indian Ocean, the country's space agency says. The bulk of the rocket was destroyed as it re-entered the atmosphere, but state media reported that debris landed just west of the Maldives on Sunday. There have been days of speculation over where the rocket might land, and US officials and other experts warned its return risked potential casualties. But China insisted the risk was low. The Long March-5b vehicle re-entered the atmosphere at 10:24 Beijing time (02:24 GMT) on Sunday, state media reported, citing the Chinese Manned Space Engineering office. There were no reports of injuries or damage."</em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-57045058">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The Red Planet rotorcraft headed south in support of furthering research into the potential use of aerial scouts on Mars in the future. NASA’s Ingenuity Mars Helicopter completed its fifth flight on the Red Planet today with its first one-way journey from Wright Brothers Field to an airfield 423 feet (129 meters) to the south. After arrival above its new airfield, Ingenuity climbed to an altitude record of 33 feet (10 meters) and captured high-resolution color images of its new neighborhood before touching down. The flight represents the rotorcraft’s transition to its new operations demonstration phase. This phase will focus on investigating what kind of capabilities a rotorcraft operating from Mars can provide. Examples include scouting, aerial observations of areas not accessible by a rover, and detailed stereo imaging from atmospheric altitudes."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/nasa-s-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-completes-first-one-way-trip">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In the sparse collection of atoms that fills interstellar space, Voyager 1 has measured a long-lasting series of waves where it previously only detected sporadic bursts. Until recently, every spacecraft in history had made all of its measurements inside our heliosphere, the magnetic bubble inflated by our Sun. But on Aug. 25, 2012, NASA’s Voyager 1 changed that. As it crossed the heliosphere’s boundary, it became the first human-made object to enter – and measure – interstellar space. Now eight years into its interstellar journey, a close listen of Voyager 1’s data is yielding new insights into what that frontier is like. If our heliosphere is a ship sailing interstellar waters, Voyager 1 is a life raft just dropped from the deck, determined to survey the currents."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/as-nasas-voyager-1-surveys-interstellar-space-its-density-measurements-are-making-waves">[...]</a>

<p><em>"NASA’s newest Mars rover is beginning to study the floor of an ancient crater that once held a lake. NASA’s Perseverance rover has been busy serving as a communications base station for the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter and documenting the rotorcraft’s historic flights. But the rover has also been busy focusing its science instruments on rocks that lay on the floor of Jezero Crater. What insights they turn up will help scientists create a timeline of when an ancient lake formed there, when it dried, and when sediment began piling up in the delta that formed in the crater long ago.

A study published today confirms that Venus’ upper atmosphere undergoes puzzling changes over a solar cycle, the Sun’s 11-year activity cycle.

MIT researchers have created a new system that automatically cleans “dirty data” — the typos, duplicates, missing values, misspellings, and inconsistencies dreaded by data analysts, data engineers, and data scientists. The system, called PClean, is the latest in a series of domain-specific probabilistic programming languages written by researchers at the Probabilistic Computing Project that aim to simplify and automate the development of AI applications (others include one for 3D perception via inverse graphics and another for modeling time series and databases). According to surveys conducted by Anaconda and Figure Eight, data cleaning can take a quarter of a data scientist's time. Automating the task is challenging because different datasets require different types of cleaning, and common-sense judgment calls about objects in the world are often needed (e.g., which of several cities called “Beverly Hills” someone lives in). PClean provides generic common-sense models for these kinds of judgment calls that can be customized to specific databases and types of errors."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/system-cleans-messy-data-tables-automatically-0511">[...]</a>

In this sense, it places a fundamental limit on the learnability of unknown processes,” said Zoe Holmes, a post-doc at Los Alamos National Laboratory and coauthor of the paper describing the work published today in Physical Review Letters. “Thankfully, because most physically interesting processes are sufficiently simple or structured so that they do not resemble a random process, the results don’t condemn quantum machine learning, but rather highlight the importance of understanding its limits,” Holmes said.

<p><em>"Engineering co-op student helps federal experts solve a messy high-tech printing problem Tomographic 3D printing is a revolutionary technology that uses light to create three-dimensional objects. A projector beams light at a rotating vial containing photocurable resin, and within seconds the desired shape forms inside the vial. The light projections needed to solidify specific 3D regions of the polymer are calculated using tomographic imaging concepts. The technology was first demonstrated by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley and Lawrence Livermore National Labs in 2019, and a Swiss group at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in 2020. It is significantly faster than traditional 3D printing in layers, can print around existing objects, and does not require support structures. Though incredible, the technology can get messy in the lab."</em> <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/news/engineering-students/making-her-mark-3d">[...]</a>

One solution for remote quantum communication lies in quantum memories: photons are stored in the long-lived quantum memory (quantum flash drive) and then quantum information is transmitted by the transportation of the quantum memory. Given the speed of aircrafts and high-speed trains, it is critical to increase the storage time of the quantum memories to the order of hours. A research team led by Prof. LI Chuanfeng and Prof. ZHOU Zongquan from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) extended the storage time of the optical memories to over one hour. They broke the record of one minute achieved by German researchers in 2013 and made a great stride towards the application of quantum memories.

A potential step forward was reported today by researchers at KTH who developed integrated chips that can generate light particles on demand and without the need for extreme refrigeration. Quantum computing today relies on states of matter, that is, electrons which carry qubits of information to perform multiple calculations simultaneously, in a fraction of the time it takes with classical computing. KTH Professor Val Zwiller says that in order to integrate quantum computing seamlessly with fiber-optic networks—which are used by the internet today—a more promising approach would be to harness optical photons. “The photonic approach offers a natural link between communication and computation,” he says. “That’s important, since the end goal is to transmit the processed quantum information using light.” Deterministic rather than random But in order for photons to deliver qubits on-demand in quantum systems, they need to be emitted in a deterministic, rather than probabilistic, fashion."</em> <a href="https://www.kth.se/en/aktuellt/nyheter/new-light-emitters-developed-for-quantum-circuits-1.1073114">[...]</a>

Inks containing metal nanoparticles are among the most commonly-used conductive materials for printed electronics. Ink-jetting layers of MNP materials allows for unpreceded design flexibility, rapid processing and 3D printing of functional electronic devices such as sensors, solar panels, LED displays, transistors and smart textiles. Inkjet 3D printing of metals typically form a solid printed object via a two-step process: solvent evaporation upon printing (pinning) and subsequent low-temperature consolidation of nanoparticles (sintering). The low temperature is important as in many applications the nanoparticles are co-printed with other functional/structural organic materials that are sensitive to higher temperatures. However, layers produced by inkjet printing of metal nanoparticles have different electrical conductivity between horizontal and vertical directions."</em> <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/stabiliser-residue-in-inks-inhibits-conductivity-in-3d-printed-electronics">[...]</a>

The ion channels of atomic scale in each neuron cell membrane plays a key role in such firings that opens and closes the ion flow in an individual cell by the electrical voltage applied across the cell membrane, acting as a “biological transistor” similar to electronic transistors in computers. For decades, scientists have learned that biological ion channels are life’s transistors capable to gate extremely fast and precisely selective permeation of ions through the atomic-scale selectivity filters to maintain vital living functions. However, it remains a grand challenge to date to produce artificial structures to mimic such biological systems for fundamental understanding and practical applications. Researchers led by Professor Xiang Zhang, the President of the University of Hong Kong (HKU), have developed an atomic-scale ion transistor based on electrically gated graphene channels of around 3 angstrom width which demonstrated highly selective ion transport.

<p><em>"A system which detects intruders in dark with a low resolution thermal camera connected to a Raspberry Pi Pico using a TensorFlow Lite model Suppose you are alone at home or out for shopping or on vacations and someone breaks into your house. First thing comes into your mind is: if there is some gadget or home security system which can alert you or your neighbors. The home security camera does a good job but they may not work in complete dark. Also, you do not want your gadget to turn on false alarm if it is a cat. In this project I built a proof of concept which merely turn on an LED when it detects a person in light or dark using just a Raspberry Pi Pico and a thermal camera. Data collection for training The first and the most important step in a machine learning project is to collect the training data in such a way that it should cover most of the representative cases for a given task."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/naveenbskumar/intruder-detection-using-ultra-low-powered-thermal-vision-24ed45">[...]</a>

Seems impossible right? Not anymore! Using an Arduino Uno, along with an XY plotter, Wizard Chess can be recreated in real life! You can now play a full game of chess using voice commands and the chess pieces will automatically react accordingly."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Wizard-Chess/">[...]</a>

This Instructable will give detailed instructions on how to make your very own obstacle avoiding R2D2. I decided to build an Obstacle Avoiding R2D2 for my Principles of Engineering SIDE Project because it seemed like a good challenge for my CAD skills. Guidance and materials were provided by my Principles of Engineering teacher Ms. Berbawy. The electronics section of R2D2 was given by user Nayantha KGD's very own Obstacle Avoiding Robot Instructable."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/3D-Printed-Obstacle-Avoiding-R2D2-Using-an-Arduino/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The Circuit Playground Extension is a tool that enables the user to design e-textile circuitry with debugging in mind. To use the tool, the user would sew the extension into their project with the holes in the extension's substrate matching with the pins that the user wants to connect to on the Circuit Playground. The user would then attach stainless steel thread to the magnet in Circuit Playground pins and to the corresponding hole in the extension. If the project is not working as expected the user can: 1. Remove thread connections to the pins, this will separate power from a particular part of the circuit so that the user can test functionality one at a time (isolation switches). 2."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Circuit-Playground-Extension-E-Textile-Debugging-T/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"I had 8 small and really old servos, as well as an ESP32 that was soldered onto a copper stripboard. I therefore decided to make a walking quadruped that would have something sticky on it's stomach, allowing it to pick things up secretly when it belly flopped, (Like a card). Because I only had 8 servos I could not use the normal 3 servos per leg that quadrupeds and hexapods use, I would be stuck using only 2 per leg. This combined with quadrupeds having a much harder time balancing than hexapods due to the gait, meant that it was destined to be slow from the start. (On the flipside, no-one ever expects a tortoise to run off with their credit card, so it always gets away). In addition, most ESP32s have wifi, so we can control the bot from a PC."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Tom-the-Tortoise-Thief/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Hello everybody In this instructable I m gonna show you how to make a simple good-looking (and good sounding) Bluetooth speaker. I made a few speakers in the past but in this one, I made my own speaker box as well (I didn't use an existing box to put an amplifier and speaker in). And since this is a Sticky Stuff Speed Challenge I used glue to put the box together so no screws were used in this project. This project isn't all that hard so you don't need some mad woodworking and electronic skills to make this, but I would recommend you a lot of patience. As I mentioned before that no screws were used in this project which means that the whole box is held together by glue. So for best results leave epoxy to set properly."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Bluetooth-Speaker-5/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The Multicolor Word Clock is a Variant of the Wordclocks which takes Advabtage of WS2812 Multicolor LEDs (aka NeoPixel) and the Power of an ESP32. Whilst other Word Clocks have the Problem that there aren't enough GPIOs for the Words, the WS2812 only need one GPIO as the Color and so the ON/OFF Info get's handed from one LED to another by the DataIN/ DOUT Pins on each LED.Logically there is only one long Ribbon of LEDs instead of single Words. To be able to take full advantage of these LEDs I took an ESP32 with a Webserver to be able to switch color modes without having to flash again. Surely the Hardware can be altered (I was too lazy to cut out the Letters) but I do like the solution with the printed Paper. This is my first instructable so be kind ;) The Code is based on Work of Rui Santos from Randomnerdtutorials.com, the greatest site to learn ESP32. Supplies: For the Clock itself I took: A Bunch of 100 WS2812 LEDs which come as one element by 10x10 LEDs."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/ESP32-Multicolor-Word-Clock/">[...]</a>

The Mission Control Center is in a self-contained wooden box that is painted a silver/gray color to look like metal. This makes it easy to transport.

I was initially inspired by RepRevMakes LED lamp on YouTube, however I did not have access to a circular saw so could not build it. I decided to re-engineer a version so it could be built without any power tools using only pre-cut parts ordered online. This creates a cube approximately 6.6 cm which is about the size of a Rubix cube, though you could scale this design up. In addition to the steps in this guide, I have created this short animated version on You Tube that covers the full build process and parts.
