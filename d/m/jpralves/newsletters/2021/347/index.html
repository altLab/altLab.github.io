<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1722, o químico e metalúrgico sueco <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axel_Fredrik_Cronstedt">Axel Fredrik Cronstedt</a>. Ele foi o primeiro a isolar o níquel (1751) e a notar as suas ligeiras propriedades magnéticas. Uma nova classificação química de minerais que ele fez foi traduzida para várias línguas. Os padrões que encontrou na estrutura interna dos minerais permitiram-lhe distinguir entre os minerais simples de um só componente e os compostos por uma mistura de vários minerais. Descobriu o zeólito, um silicato suavizante da água e analisou o tungstato mineral de cálcio de alta densidade. Através da utilização hábil do maçarico para intensificar uma chama e queimar uma pequena quantidade de um mineral, pôde fazer uma identificação da sua composição química com base na cor da chama. Ele não inventou o instrumento, mas fundou uma técnica de análise sistemática do maçarico.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1732, o industrial e inventor inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Arkwright">Richard Arkwright</a>. Ele introduziu métodos de produção de fábricas têxteis mecanizados e motorizados que foi muito bem sucedida. A máquina Spinning-Frame que ele inventou (1769, patente britânica nº 931) para fiar fio de algodão utilizava múltiplos conjuntos de rolos emparelhados que giravam a diferentes velocidades capazes de extrair fio com a espessura correcta, e um conjunto de fusos para torcer as fibras firmemente juntas. Produziu um fio muito mais forte do que o fio feito pela Spinning-Jenny de James Hargreaves. A máquina de Arkwright era demasiado grande para ser accionada manualmente, por isso ele alimentou-a com uma roda de água (1771) quando ficou conhecida como a Moldura de Água. O negócio têxtil de Arkwright expandiu-se, ele construiu mais fábricas, e mais tarde adoptou a força do vapor.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1766, o mineralogista sueco <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Hisinger">Wilhelm Hisinger</a>. Ele herdou o trabalho em ferro do seu pai, e prosseguiu a ciência em privado. De uma das suas minas de ferro em Bastnäs veio um mineral de densidade invulgarmente elevada. Hisinger distribuiu amostras a vários analistas químicos europeus. Após o seu exame em 1803, Martin Klaproth suspeitou que o mesmo continha um novo elemento. Nesse ano, tanto Hisinger como Jöns Berzelius isolaram o novo elemento. Deram-lhe o nome de cerium em reconhecimento da descoberta de Giussepe Piazzi da nova planta menor, Ceres, dois anos antes (1 de Janeiro de 1801). Em 1806, Hisinger investigou o efeito da electricidade nas soluções salinas. Ele contribuiu para o conhecimento geológico do seu país, e registou descobertas dos seus fósseis de animais e plantas. Também acumulou colecções de rochas finas, minerais e fósseis, que acabou por dar ao museu de história natural sueco.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1822, o inventor alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Bauer">Wilhelm Bauer</a>. Ele foi um pioneiro dos submarinos. A 1 de Fevereiro de 1851, no porto de Kiel, fez uma prova de mergulho no seu primeiro submarino, Le Plongeur-Marin ("O Mergulhador Marinho"), apenas para afundar a 50 pés devido a fugas de água no casco. Sobreviveu esperando que a pressão do ar interior, comprimida à medida que mais água vazava para dentro, igualasse a pressão da água no exterior. Sete horas mais tarde, ele e a sua tripulação abriram a escotilha e subiram à superfície para encontrar serviços funerários em curso. Em 1855, Bauer construiu um submarino de ferro de 52 pés, de quatro homens, Le Diable-Marin ("O Diabo Marinho") com 11 tripulantes. As fotografias que Bauer fez através das suas janelas são provavelmente as primeiras tiradas debaixo de água. Ele também experimentou a purificação do ar e sinais sonoros subaquáticos.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1938, o cientista informático norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Kahn">Bob Kahn</a>. Ele co-criou os protocolos de comutação de pacotes que permitem aos computadores trocar informações na Internet. No final dos anos 60, Kahn percebeu que uma rede de comutação de pacotes podia efectivamente transmitir grandes quantidades de dados entre computadores. Juntamente com colegas cientistas informáticos Vinton Cerf, Lawrence Roberts, Paul Baran, e Leonard Kleinrock, Kahn construiu a ARPANET, a primeira rede a ligar com sucesso computadores em todo o país. Kahn e Cerf também desenvolveram o Protocolo de Controlo de Transmissão (TCP) e o Protocolo Internet (IP), que juntos permitem a comunicação entre diferentes tipos de computadores e redes; o TCP/IP é o padrão ainda hoje em uso. É graças aos contributos de Kahn que é possível neste momento ler esta newsletter!</p>

<p>Após nove dias e quatro minutos no céu, o avião experimental Voyager aterrava na Base Aérea Edwards na Califórnia, completando o primeiro voo ininterrupto à volta do globo com uma única carga de combustível. Pilotada pelos americanos Dick Rutan e Jeana Yeager, a Voyager foi feita principalmente de plástico e papel reforçado e transportou mais de três vezes o seu peso em combustível quando descolou da Base da Força Aérea de Edwards a 14 de Dezembro. Quando regressou, depois de voar 25.012 milhas à volta do planeta, já tinha apenas cinco galões de combustível no seu restante tanque de combustível operacional. Estávamos no ano de 1986.</p>

<p>Em 23 de Dezembro de 1672, o astrónomo italiano Giovanni Cassini descobriu Rhea, a segunda maior lua de Saturno. Rea é feita de rocha e gelo e está coberta de crateras. Rhea é também a única lua descoberta a ter uma atmosfera de oxigénio. Rea foi a segunda lua que Cassini descobriu. Ele descobriu a lua de Saturno Iapetus cerca de um ano antes.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou e após mais de duas décadas de desenvolvimento, o telescópio espacial de próxima geração da NASA está na plataforma de lançamento. O Telescópio Espacial James Webb deverá ser lançado no sábado (25 de Dezembro) durante uma janela de 32 minutos que abre às 7:20 EST (1220 GMT). O enorme observatório será lançado de Kourou, Guiana Francesa, sobre um foguete Ariane 5 operado pelo fornecedor europeu de lançamento Arianespace.</p>

<p><em>"Data processing unit more than quadruples previous record holder by exceeding 41 million IOPS between server and storage. Data centers need extremely fast storage access, and no DPU is faster than NVIDIA’s BlueField-2. Recent testing by NVIDIA shows that two BlueField-2 data processing units reached 41.5 million input/output operations per second (IOPS) — more than 4x more IOPS than any other DPU. The BlueField-2 DPU delivered record-breaking performance using standard networking protocols and open-source software. It reached more than 5 million 4KB IOPS and from 7 million to over 20 million 512B IOPS for NVMe over Fabrics (NVMe-oF), a common method of accessing storage media, with TCP networking, one of the primary internet protocols. To accelerate AI, big data and high performance computing applications, BlueField provides even higher storage performance using the popular RoCE network transport option."</em> <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/12/21/bluefield-dpu-world-record-performance/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A boost to development of no-plug charging EVs and transition to renewable energy. Toshiba Corporation (TOKYO: 6502) today announced that it has successfully raised the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of its transparent Cu2O solar cell to 8.4%, the world’s highest level for a reported Cu2O solar cell(*1). With the cell positioned as the top cell over a 25% PCE silicon cell (Cu2O-Si tandem cell), Toshiba estimates that an overall PCE of 27.4% can be achieved, notably above the 26.7% highest PCE reported for any standard silicon cell(*2). Under the test criteria defined by Japan’s New Energy and Industry Technology Development Organization (NEDO), Toshiba estimates that the Cu2O-Si tandem cell will carry an EV 35km without any need of recharging. Looking ahead, Toshiba expects the new cell to boost development of EVs with no need for plug-in charging, and to advance other mobility applications, such as the High Altitude Platform Station (HAPS), the telecom platform in the stratosphere.

<p><em>"SpaceX launched its second rocket in less than 24 hours on Saturday night (Dec. 18), delivering a Turkish communications satellite into orbit before capping off the successful mission with a landing at sea. A 230-foot-tall (70 meters) Falcon 9 rocket blasted off from Space Launch Complex 40 here at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station at 10:58 p.m. EST (0358 GMT on Dec. 19), at the beginning of a planned 90-minute window, carrying the Turksat 5B satellite into space. Approximately nine minutes later, the rocket's first stage returned to Earth, touching down on the deck of SpaceX's newest drone ship, "A Shortfall of Gravitas." The ship is one of three massive floating landing pads that the California-based aerospace company uses to recover its rockets. The other two — named "Of Course I Still Love You" and "Just Read the Instructions" — are carrying out missions of their own, marking the first time ever that all three drone ships are deployed at the same time. "Falcon 9 has successfully lifted off from SLC-40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force station carrying a satellite to geosynchronous transfer orbit," SpaceX's principal integration engineer John Insprucker said during a live webcast of the launch."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-falcon-9-rocket-turksat-5b-launch-success">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A Chinese physicist has said that a new wind tunnel in Beijing to be unveiled “soon” will put China decades ahead of the rest of the world in hypersonic technology. Chinese Academy of Sciences researcher Han Guilai told an online lecture last week that the JF-22 wind tunnel, in Beijing’s Huairou district, was capable of simulating flights at up to 10km per second – 30 times the speed of sound. Together with an existing facility, also in Beijing, it would put China “about 20 to 30 years ahead” of the West. Han, from China’s top hypersonic research agency the Institute of Mechanics, said the surface of an aeroplane travelling at such a speed could reach 10,000 degrees Celsius (18,032 Fahrenheit) – hot enough to break air molecules into atoms, even giving some of them an electric charge. “This air is no longer the air we breathe in,” said Han. “The flying vehicle we study is like swimming in mud.” Han said the power produced by the JF-22 wind tunnel would reach 15 gigawatts – nearly 70 per cent of the installed capacity of the world’s largest hydropower station Three Gorges Dam in China’s southwestern Sichuan province, or more than seven times the Hoover Dam in Nevada."</em> <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3135491/mach-30-wind-tunnel-put-china-decades-ahead-hypersonic-race">[...]</a>

<p><em>"When fully operational, Hornsea 2’s 165 8 MW Siemens Gamesa wind turbines will be capable of generating 1.32 GW of clean electricity – taking the title of ‘world’s largest operating offshore wind farm’ from its sibling project Hornsea 1. Together, the two projects will be capable of providing enough power for well over 2.3 million homes. First power on Hornsea 2, which is located 89 km off the UK's east coast, was achieved after its offshore substation (OSS), the world’s largest offshore AC substation, and reactive compensation station (RCS), were installed in late October 2021. Since that time, Ørsted and its partner companies have been working hard to commission and energise the wind farm in preparation for its anticipated operational date next year. Once Hornsea 2 is completed, power will be transferred from the 165 wind turbines via 373 km of array cables to the OSS and RCS, reaching the national grid via 390 km of offshore and 40 km of onshore export cables which terminate at the onshore substation in Killingholme. A further two projects in the Hornsea Zone are also underway with Hornsea 3 receiving a Development Consent Order in December 2020 and Hornsea 4 currently going through the planning process."</em> <a href="https://orsted.com/en/media/newsroom/news/2021/12/20211220460511">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Breakthrough could lead to high-speed, low-power nanoscale data storage Ever since graphene – a thin carbon sheet just one-atom thick – was discovered more than 15 years ago, the wonder material became a workhorse in materials science research. From this body of work, other researchers learned that slicing graphene along the edge of its honeycomb lattice creates one-dimensional zigzag graphene strips or nanoribbons with exotic magnetic properties. Many researchers have sought to harness nanoribbons’ unusual magnetic behavior into carbon-based, spintronics devices that enable high-speed, low-power data storage and information processing technologies by encoding data through electron spin instead of charge. But because zigzag nanoribbons are highly reactive, researchers have grappled with how to observe and channel their exotic properties into a real-world device. Now, as reported in the journal Nature, researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) and UC Berkeley have developed a method to stabilize the edges of graphene nanoribbons and directly measure their unique magnetic properties. The team co-led by Felix Fischer and Steven Louie, both faculty scientists in Berkeley Lab’s Materials Sciences Division, found that by substituting some of the carbon atoms along the ribbon’s zigzag edges with nitrogen atoms, they could discretely tune the local electronic structure without disrupting the magnetic properties."</em> <a href="https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2021/12/22/graphene-nanoribbons-electronic/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.icems.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/news/6931/">Nanodiamonds are key to efficient hydrogen purification</a></h2>

<p><em>"Nanodiamonds may be tiny, but they can help with one of the biggest problems facing humanity today: Climate change. Hydrogen, a clean-burning fuel, leaves nothing but water when consumed. Many countries view hydrogen as a way to a zero-carbon future, but switching to a hydrogen economy requires its production to be much more affordable than it is now. In a study published in Nature Energy this month, researchers led by Kyoto University’s Institute for Integrated Cell-Material Sciences (iCeMS) describe how nanodiamond-reinforced composite membranes can purify hydrogen from its humid mixtures, making the hydrogen generation processes vastly more efficient and cost-effective. “There are several scalable methodologies to produce hydrogen, but hydrogen generally comes as humid mixtures and their purification is a challenge,” says Professor Easan Sivaniah, who led the iCeMS team. “Membrane technology allows for energy-efficient and economical separation processes."</em> <a href="https://www.icems.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/news/6931/">[...]</a>

Aerospace engineers at MIT are testing a new concept for a hovering rover that levitates by harnessing the moon’s natural charge. Because they lack an atmosphere, the moon and other airless bodies such as asteroids can build up an electric field through direct exposure to the sun and surrounding plasma. On the moon, this surface charge is strong enough to levitate dust more than 1 meter above the ground, much the way static electricity can cause a person’s hair to stand on end. Engineers at NASA and elsewhere have recently proposed harnessing this natural surface charge to levitate a glider with wings made of Mylar, a material that naturally holds the same charge as surfaces on airless bodies. They reasoned that the similarly charged surfaces should repel each other, with a force that lofts the glider off the ground."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/moon-hovering-rover-1221">[...]</a>

In order to prevent that from happening researchers are working to solve the problem of dissipating heat produced during performance. Heat that is generated in the device during operation has to flow out, ideally with little hinderance to reduce the temperature rise. Often this thermal energy must cross several dissimilar materials during the process and the interface between these materials can cause challenges by impeding heat flow. A new study from researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology, Notre Dame, University of California Los Angeles, University of California Irvine, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the Naval Research Laboratory observed interfacial phonon modes which only exist at the interface between silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge). This discovery, published in the journal Nature Communications, shows experimentally that decades-old conventional theories for interfacial heat transfer are not complete and the inclusion of these phonon modes are warranted."</em> <a href="https://research.gatech.edu/georgia-tech-researchers-develop-new-measurements-designing-cooler-electronics">[...]</a>

But in the three years since that time many things in the world have changed, most notably of all being the fact that the stair lights stopped working. First the SD card mysteriously became corrupted, then after acquiring a new one and installing the software and copying over the stair light code, I was able to get it working again.. for about a week. It was clear this wasn't going to be a simple fix. I had two options, take the construction I had apart completely and try to figure out where it was going wrong or do something else."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/ukcraigrich/pico-stair-lights-452798">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A digital clock to help small children to differentiate day time and night time through colours. Background Small children have a tendency to wake up in the middle of the night or very early in the morning. Unfortunately at this age, they also usually haven’t learned how to tell time. So, I needed a way of helping the smol humans to know if it is still sleep time or not when they wake up. Someone told me about a clock that changes colour at night, to indicate that it is in fact night. But, instead of looking further into that and possibly buying one, I figured it would be much more fun to make one."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/johan_m_o/night-time-clock-8c05da">[...]</a>

<p><em>"For years I’ve been using FDM printers as my go-to for 3D printing, but recently expanded my horizons into resin printing. I like my LuzlBot Mini 2 but can never get it dialed to the point were I can achieve quality similar to resin prints. An aside to all this was the desire to record time-lapse videos – which is challenging on FDM printers as you need to integrate into the controller / g-code, and I just don’t have the patience for that at this time. For resin printers, creating a time-lapse is straight forward. Just trigger a frame capture with each layer change (or multiple layer changes if you like). Since each time a layer is cured, the UV light comes on, you simply need to watch that light with a sensor and trigger a frame capture which builds into a movie over time."</em> <a href="http://www.plastibots.com/index.php/2021/12/22/re-lapse-resin-print-time-lapse-recording-with-esp32-cam-and-blynk/">[...]</a>

After making hovercrafts, I decided that I would need a remote control if I wanted to use a home made drone (maybe for a future project). As a consequence, I created my own remote controller. Indeed, I had a controller before, but it was pretty useless in this case, because driving a drone certainly needs more informations, to avoid a potential crash. So, I decided to make this brand new remote controller, composed of a TFT screen, nRF24l01 radio module and arduino mega. Firstly, I needed a controller capable of displaying informations about the RC device connected to it : speed, motor thrust, angle, etc... Then, I wanted something adapted to each situation : that's why I've made different templates on this controller to ensure the remote control has at least a template for each device."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/MisterBotBreak/how-to-make-a-rc-controller-2-3e8192">[...]</a>

In fact I'm such a cheapskate that I didn't even want to spend small dollars.

We will be capturing 802.11 beacons because they are ubiquitous in 5GHz and easy to control on most routers. Note: On many routers still supporting 802.11b, 2.4GHz Beacons use DSSS instead of OFDM. OpenWRT based routers have the option to disable DSSS on 2.4GHz, while most OEM's don't offer such option.
