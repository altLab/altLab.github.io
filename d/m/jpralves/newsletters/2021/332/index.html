<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1737, o médico e físico italiano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Galvani">Luigi Galvani</a>. Ele estudou a estrutura dos órgãos e a fisiologia dos tecidos que é mais conhecida pela sua investigação sobre a natureza e efeitos do que concebeu como sendo electricidade em tecidos animais. Observou como os músculos das rãs se torciam quando eram tocados por contactos metálicos, mas atribuiu erroneamente isto à "electricidade animal" inata (a corrente era de facto produzida pelos contactos metálicos). Isto foi contestado por Alessandro Volta que, no decurso deste argumento, inventou a sua célula electroquímica. A corrente produzida por este dispositivo foi durante muitos anos chamada "electricidade galvânica". O galvanómetro recebeu o seu nome.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1852, o físico britânico <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Henry_Poynting">John Henry Poynting</a>. Ele introduziu um teorema (1884-85) que atribui um valor à taxa de fluxo de energia electromagnética conhecido como o vector Poynting, introduzido no seu artigo Sobre a Transferência de Energia no Campo Electromagnético (1884). Nisto ele mostrou que o fluxo de energia num ponto pode ser expresso por uma fórmula simples em termos das forças eléctricas e magnéticas nesse ponto. Ele determinou a densidade média da Terra (1891) e fez uma determinação da constante gravitacional (1893) utilizando balanços de torção precisos. Foi também o primeiro a sugerir, em 1903, a existência do efeito da radiação do Sol que faz com que partículas mais pequenas em órbita em torno do Sol se fechem em espiral e acabem por mergulhar para dentro.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1922, o físico americano nascido na Alemanha <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Georg_Dehmelt">Hans Georg Dehmelt</a>. Ele "para o desenvolvimento da técnica da armadilha iónica" partilhou o Prémio Nobel da Física de 1989 (com o físico alemão Wolfgang Paul e Norman Ramsey). Os seus métodos permitiram o estudo de um único electrão ou de um único ião com extrema precisão. O dispositivo electromagnético de Delmelt, a armadilha de Penning, em 1973 observou com sucesso um único electrão na armadilha. Em 1975, ele introduziu uma técnica para "arrefecer" o electrão. Mais tarde, na década de 1970, Dehmelt juntamente com P. Toschek conseguiram observar um único ião numa armadilha. Isto levou à espectroscopia de um íon, um novo tipo de espectroscopia.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1941, o cientista informático americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie">Dennis Ritchie</a>. Ele criou a linguagem de programação C e, com o colega de longa data Ken Thompson, o sistema operativo Unix e a linguagem de programação B. Ritchie e Thompson receberam o Prémio Turing da ACM em 1983, a Medalha Hamming da IEEE em 1990 e a Medalha Nacional de Tecnologia do Presidente Bill Clinton em 1999. Ritchie era o chefe do Departamento de Investigação de Software de Sistemas da Lucent Technologies quando se reformou em 2007. Era o "R" em K&amp;R C, e comummente conhecido pelo seu nome de utilizador dmr.</p>

<p>Em 1947, uma equipa de cientistas informáticos relatou o primeiro bug informático do mundo. Um bug é uma falha ou falha de um sistema. Thomas Edison relatou "bugs" nas suas concepções já no século XIX, mas este foi o primeiro bug identificado num computador. Hoje em dia, os bugs de software podem ter impacto no funcionamento, resiliência, e segurança dos sistemas operativos de computador. A "depuração" e a gestão de bugs são partes importantes da indústria do IT. Este bug, no entanto, era literalmente um bug. "Primeiro caso real de bug a ser encontrado", um dos membros da equipa escreveu no livro de registo. A equipa da Universidade de Harvard em Cambridge, Massachusetts, descobriu que o seu computador, o Mark II, estava a cometer erros consistentes. Quando abriram o hardware do computador, encontraram... uma traça. O insecto encurralado tinha perturbado a electrónica do computador.</p>

<p><em>"Perseverance will obtain additional imagery of the sample tube before potentially completing the process of collecting its first scientifically-selected Mars sample. Data received late Sept. 1 from NASA’s Perseverance rover indicate the team has achieved its goal of successfully coring a Mars rock. The initial images downlinked after the historic event show an intact sample present in the tube after coring. However, additional images taken after the arm completed sample acquisition were inconclusive due to poor sunlight conditions. Another round of images with better lighting will be taken before the sample processing continues. Obtaining additional imagery prior to proceeding with the sealing and storing of Mars rock sample is an extra step the team opted to include based on its experience with the rover’s sampling attempt on Aug. 5."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-perseverance-rover-successfully-cores-its-first-rock">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.sony-semicon.co.jp/e/news/2021/2021090901.html">Sony to Release Two Types of Stacked Event-Based Vision Sensors with the Industry’s Smallest*1 4.86μm Pixel Size for Detecting Subject Changes Only Delivering High-Speed, High-Precision Data Acquisition to Improve Industrial Equipment Productivity</a></h2>

<p><em>"Sony Semiconductor Solutions Corporation (“Sony”) today announced the upcoming release of two types of stacked event-based vision sensors. These sensors designed for industrial equipment are capable of detecting only subject changes, and achieve the industry’s smallest*1 pixel size of 4.86μm. Event-based vision sensors asynchronously detect luminance changes for each pixel and output the changed data only, combining it with information on pixel position (xy coordinates) and time, thereby enabling high-speed, low latency data output. The two new sensors employ stacking technology leveraging Sony’s proprietary Cu-Cu connection*2 to achieve the industry’s smallest*1 pixel size of 4.86μm. In addition to operating with low power consumption and delivering high-speed, low-latency, high-temporal-resolution data output, the new sensors also feature a surprisingly high resolution for their small size. All of these advantages combine to ensure immediate detection of moving subjects in diverse environments and situations."</em> <a href="https://www.sony-semicon.co.jp/e/news/2021/2021090901.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"New process efficiently recovers high-purity rare-earth compounds from motor magnets, practical application targeted for mid-2020s toward carbon neutral goal Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. and Waseda University today announced the start of testing in Japan of a jointly developed recycling process that efficiently recovers high-purity rare-earth compounds from electrified vehicle motor magnets. The testing is aimed at enabling practical application of the new process by the mid-2020s. The automotive industry is promoting vehicle electrification to tackle climate change and to realize a carbon-neutral society. Most motors in electrified vehicles use neodymium magnets, which contain scarce rare-earth metals such as neodymium and dysprosium. Reducing the use of scarce rare earths is important not only because of the environmental impact of mining and refining, but also because the shifting balance of supply and demand leads to price fluctuations for both manufacturers and consumers. To use limited and valuable resources more effectively, since 2010 Nissan has been working from the design stage to reduce the amount1 of heavy rare-earth elements (REEs) in motor magnets."</em> <a href="https://global.nissannews.com/en/releases/nissan-waseda-university-in-japan-testing-jointly-developed-recycling-process-for-ev-motors">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scientists from Japan have quantitatively evaluated ion-trapping-induced degradation in lithium intercalated tungsten oxide films Tungsten oxide, an electrochromic (EC) material with immense potential for technical applications such as in smart windows, has attracted much interest for its energy-saving qualities. However, after multiple cycles, such EC devices exhibit degradation in optical modulation and reversibility owing to lithium-ion trapping. Now, Japanese scientists have adopted a quantitative approach to understand the irreversibility of lithium intercalated tungsten oxide films, laying the groundwork for developing superior electrochromic materials and devices. Electrochromic (EC) materials, one of the key "green" technological components for sustainability and energy savings, have piqued the interest of academia and industry alike. Tungsten oxide (WO3) is among the most extensively researched EC materials that is widely used in today's "smart windows." One popular EC approach is the reversible insertion of small ions into electrode materials."</em> <a href="https://www.tus.ac.jp/en/mediarelations/archive/20210907_7385.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Valleytronics is an emerging field in which valleys—local minima in the energy band structure of solids—are used to encode, process, and store quantum information. Though graphene was thought to be unsuitable for valleytronics due to its symmetrical structure, researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, India, have recently shown that this is not the case. Their findings may pave the way to small-sized quantum computers that can operate at room temperature. From the consumer’s side, it’s pretty easy to notice the giant strides that the field of electronics has made over the past few decades; with wearable gadgets, smart cities, self-driving cars, improved space missions, robots, holography, and supercomputers, the possibilities of technological advancement seem infinite. However, unbeknownst to most people, this accelerated trend of technological advancement fueled by electronics is rapidly coming to a halt as electronic components reach their practical limits. If we are to keep improving our computing power and capacity, we will need to find new ways to store and process data beyond the simple flow and charge of electrons, which is how modern electronics operates."</em> <a href="https://rnd.iitb.ac.in/research-glimpse/graphene-valleytronics-paving-way-small-sized-room-temperature-quantum-computers">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Fuel-powered auxiliary heaters can be significant sources of particulate emissions from vehicles, a new study from Finland shows. Heaters, sold under such well-known brand names as Webasto and Eberspächer, among others, are used in both passenger cars and heavy-duty vehicles to preheat the engine and provide additional cabin heating while driving. Emissions from heaters are not regulated, although they are widely used in especially colder regions, such as Finland. Therefore, they can have a significant impact on local air quality, and even on regional or global emissions budgets. Researchers from Tampere University and the University of Eastern Finland studied the emissions of a total of eight selected vehicles equipped with an additional heater, either diesel or gasoline, depending on the car's propulsion power. Tests were carried out in collaboration with Dekati Ltd. Postdoctoral Researcher Panu Karjalainen from Tampere University says that the results of the study show that the particulate emissions of auxiliary heaters can be up to a thousand times higher than the particulate emissions of idling gasoline vehicles."</em> <a href="https://www.uef.fi/en/article/surprisingly-high-emissions-from-fuel-powered-auxiliary-heaters-in-cars">[...]</a>

A high-entropy alloy composed of 10 or more elements may act as a catalyst to exhibit" omnipotency and versatility" being able to freely modify its morphology and become active according to the reaction field. However, so far, it has not been easy to produce entropy alloys composed of more than 10 elements. The reason is the existence of combinations of some elements that are hard to be mixed, like water and oil. A joint research group led by Research Associate Cai ZeXing and Professor Takeshi Fujita at School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Kochi University of Technology, and Professor Masahiro Miyauchi at School of Materials Science and Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology has developed a “nanoporous super multi-element catalyst” by a method called de-alloying(3) via the selective corrosion and elusion of a specified element from the alloy.

Compared to other popular digital FM tuners (RDA5807, TEA5767, etc. ), this tuner does not seem to be as popular among the DIY community. In this article, I will describe my test setup and software applications built around this IC. After a few days of testing, I construct a fully functioning Raspberry Pi 3 based FM radio receiver using this IC."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/dilshan-jayakody/fm-stereo-receiver-add-on-for-raspberry-pi-98664d">[...]</a>

<p><em>"I wanted to build a TinyML model that could detect when a boat is nearby by listening for it on a hydrophone. Edge Impulse makes it easy to build ML Models that can run on an Arduino board and detect events in audio. The tricky part ended up being how to connect a hydrophone to an Arduino board. I looked around but didn't see any existing boards for powering and amplifying a microphone, like the hydrophone... so I decided to build one! I started by modifying the Electret Microphone module from Adafruit. It powers and amplifies the microphone."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/robotastic/hydrophone-feather-board-03f1d7">[...]</a>
