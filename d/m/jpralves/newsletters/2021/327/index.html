<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1802, o matemático norueguês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Henrik_Abel">Niels Henrik Abel</a>. Ele desenvolveu vários ramos da matemática moderna. Após um início lento na escola, começou a mostrar genialidade matemática aos 15 anos de idade. Em 1823 provou que não havia fórmula algébrica para a solução de uma equação polinomial geral do quinto grau. Ele desenvolveu o conceito de funções elípticas independentemente de Carl Gustav Jacobi, e a teoria dos integrais e funções abelianas tornou-se um tema central da análise do final do século XIX.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1924, o cientista chinês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huang_Hongjia">Huang Hongjia</a>. Ele desenvolveu a teoria das ondas de acoplamento no campo da teoria das micro-ondas. Liderou uma equipa de investigação que desenvolveu com sucesso fibras ópticas mono-modo em 1980.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1930, o Astronauta norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong">Neil Alden Armstrong</a>. Ele foi o primeiro homem a caminhar na lua (a 20 de Julho de 1969, Apollo 11). Serviu como piloto da Marinha durante a Guerra da Coreia, tendo depois ingressado no Comité Consultivo Nacional para a Aeronáutica (que se tornou na NASA), como piloto de testes civis. Em 1962, foi o primeiro civil a entrar no programa de treino de astronautas. Ganhou experiência como piloto de comando da missão Gemini 8, que realizou a primeira união física de duas naves espaciais em órbita. Mais tarde, foi comandante da missão lunar da Apollo 11.</p>

<p>Faz hoje 48 anos que era lançada a sonda Mars 6 em direcção a Marte. Esta foi uma das várias sondas soviéticas Mars - 4, 5, 6, e 7 - lançada em Julho-Agosto de 1973. Ao chegar a Marte, o módulo de descida solto-se para a sua missão de estudar a atmosfera e a superfície de Marte. Após 224 segundos de transmissão de dados - os primeiros dados devolvidos da atmosfera de Marte - o contacto com o módulo de descida perdeu-se antes da sua planeada aterragem à superfície. Infelizmente, muitos destes dados eram ilegíveis devido a um chip de computador defeituoso. Foram relatadas informações sobre pressão, temperatura e vapor de água. O módulo de descida continuou a enviar as medições dos seus próprios instrumentos.</p>

<p>Em 1858 era completado o primeiro cabo transatlântico de telegrafo. Estendendo-se por quase 3200 quilómetros através do Atlântico a uma profundidade frequentemente superior a três quilómetros. A 16 de Agosto, o Presidente James Buchanan e a Rainha Vitória trocaram mensagens formais introdutórias e de cortesia. Infelizmente, o cabo revelou-se fraco e a corrente insuficiente e, no início de Setembro, tinha deixado de funcionar.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou o satélite EUTELSAT QUANTUM foi lançado com sucesso na órbita de transferência geoestacionária pela Arianespace utilizando um foguete Ariane 5 que descolou do Centro Espacial da Guiana em Kourou, Guiana Francesa, às 21 horas, hora universal (23 horas CET) do dia 30 de Julho. A separação ocorreu após um voo de 37 minutos e a verificação dos sistemas das naves espaciais foi então completada com sucesso durante um período de aproximadamente 3 horas. Construído pela Airbus Defence and Space, o EUTELSAT QUANTUM anuncia uma nova era de serviço comercial via satélite. As suas características reprogramáveis em órbita estabelecem um novo padrão de flexibilidade que permitirá aos utilizadores, nomeadamente nos mercados de Governo e Mobilidade, definir e moldar activamente o desempenho e alcançar graças ao seu desenho baseado em software.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker assim como alguns videos interessantes.</p>

<h2><a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4377.html">STMicroelectronics’ STM32U5 General-Purpose Microcontrollers Achieve PSA Certified Level-3 and SESIP3 Security Certifications</a></h2>

<p><em>"STMicroelectronics has announced PSA Certified Level-3 and SESIP 3 certifications for its general-purpose secure STM32U585* microcontroller, passing tests for logical, board, and basic physical resistance that confirm a substantial level of cyber protection. With enhanced tamper resistance and software protection, the STM32U585 is also suitable for controlling PIN Transaction Security (PTS) equipment that must satisfy Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) requirements. As a secure, general-purpose microcontroller, the STM32U585 offers an all-in-one solution that simplifies the design and production of Point-Of-Sale (POS) and self-service payment terminals. Typically, achieving recognition as an official PTS Approved Device requires a dedicated security chip to resist online and side-channel attacks, with a separate microcontroller (MCU) to manage features such as the keyboard, display, and USB connection. The STM32U585 can now consolidate all these capabilities, enabling a simplified design and streamlining production logistics from purchasing and inventory management to final assembly.

<p><em>"An electrified highway is theoretically the most efficient way to eliminate truck emissions. But the political obstacles are daunting. On a highway south of Frankfurt recently, Thomas Schmieder maneuvered his Scania tractor-trailer and its load of house paint into the far right lane. Then he flicked a switch you won’t find on most truck dashboards. Outside the cab a contraption started to unfold from the roof, looking like a clothes-drying rack with an upside-down sled welded to the top. As Mr. Schmieder continued driving, a video display showed the metal skids rising up and pushing gently against wires running overhead."</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/business/electric-trucks-catenary-wire.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Japan's Tetra Aviation won a hundred-grand "disruptor award" at the GoFly personal flight contest last year, and has now presented its first commercial product at OshKosh: a 33-rotor Mk5 personal eVTOL it hopes to begin delivering to buyers in 2022. The Mk5 is a lightweight single-seat lift-and-cruise-style aircraft running 32 vertical lift rotors distributed across long, thin wings at the front and rear of a small cabin, with a single pusher prop on the rear for cruise flight. Its frame is mainly aluminum, and the bodywork is a lightweight carbon fiber reinforced polymer with some aramid fibers in there too. The prototype shown at OshKosh this year, which has already flown, is a decent size at 8.62 m (28.2 feet) wide, 6.15 m (20.2 ft) long and 2.51 m (8.2 ft) high, so it'll take up a fair bit of room in the garage. With a 13.5-kWh battery pack, it weighs 488 kg (1,076 lb) empty and has a maximum takeoff weight of 567 kg (1,250 lb) – leaving room for a 79-kg (174-lb) pilot or less. Many of these figures will move north for the production version, which is designed to take at least a 91-kg (200-lb) pilot, and fly at cruise speeds up to 160 km/h (100 mph) for VTOL ranges as high as 160 km (100 miles) on a charge."</em> <a href="https://newatlas.com/aircraft/tetra-aviation-mk5-evtol/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A heavy chorus of bolting and machinery filled the X-59 Quiet SuperSonic Technology, or QueSST, assembly building as engineers, system technicians, and aircraft fabricators worked to merge the major aircraft sections together, making it look like an actual aircraft for the first time since the initial cut of metal in 2018. "We’ve now transitioned from being a bunch of separate parts sitting around on different parts of the production floor to an airplane,” said Jay Brandon, NASA chief engineer for the Low Boom Flight Demonstrator (LBFD) project. NASA’s X-59 QueSST is under construction at Lockheed Martin Skunk Works in Palmdale, California, and is designed to fly at supersonic speeds – approximately 660 mph at sea level - without producing a startling sonic boom for people on the ground. NASA will work with U.S. communities to understand their response to the aircraft’s sound and provide that data to regulators, which could change the rules that currently ban supersonic flight over land, cutting travel time in half for air travelers in the near future. The Merger With great precision and accuracy, the team used features on the structure to precisely self-locate the aircraft’s wing, tail assembly, and fuselage or forward section, then employed a series of laser projections to verify the precise fit. “The extensive use of features and pre-drilled, full-size fastener holes has significantly reduced the time it takes to locate and fit parts, especially mating large assemblies like this,” said David Richardson, Lockheed Martin program director."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/x-59-resembles-actual-aircraft">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Two physicists, from EPFL and Columbia University, have introduced an approach for simulating the quantum approximate optimization algorithm using a traditional computer. Instead of running the algorithm on advanced quantum processors, the new approach uses a classical machine-learning algorithm that closely mimics the behavior of near-term quantum computers. In a paper published in Nature Quantum Information, EPFL professor Giuseppe Carleo and Matija Medvidović, a graduate student at Columbia University and at the Flatiron Institute in New York, have found a way to execute a complex quantum computing algorithm on traditional computers instead of quantum ones. The specific “quantum software” they are considering is known as Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and is used to solve classical optimization problems in mathematics; it’s essentially a way of picking the best solution to a problem out of a set of possible solutions. “There is a lot of interest in understanding what problems can be solved efficiently by a quantum computer, and QAOA is one of the more prominent candidates,” says Carleo. Ultimately, QAOA is meant to help us on the way to the famed “quantum speedup”, the predicted boost in processing speed that we can achieve with quantum computers instead of conventional ones."</em> <a href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/running-quantum-software-on-a-classical-computer/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Two-photon lithography (TPL) — a widely used 3D nanoprinting technique that uses laser light to create 3D objects — has shown promise in research applications but has yet to achieve widespread industry acceptance due to limitations on large-scale part production and time-intensive setup. Capable of printing nanoscale features at a very high resolution, TPL uses a laser beam to build parts, focusing an intense beam of light on a precise spot within a liquid photopolymer material. The volumetric pixels, or “voxels,” harden the liquid to a solid at each point the beam hits and the uncured liquid is removed, leaving behind a 3D structure. Building a high-quality part with the technique requires walking a fine line: too little light and a part can’t form, too much and it causes damage. For operators and engineers, determining the correct light dosage can be a laborious manual process. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) scientists and collaborators turned to machine learning to address two key barriers to industrialization of TPL: monitoring of part quality during printing and determining the right light dosage for a given material."</em> <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/news/machine-learning-model-may-perfect-3d-nanoprinting">[...]</a>

One of the keys to making microelectronic devices faster and more energy efficient, as well as designing new computer architectures, is the discovery of new materials with tunable electronic properties. The electrical resistivity of MITs may exhibit metallic or insulating electronic behavior, depending on the properties of the environment. Although some materials that exhibit MITs have already been implemented in electronic devices, only fewer than 70 with this property are known, and even fewer exhibit the performance necessary for integration into new electronic devices. Further, these materials switch electrically due to a variety of mechanisms, which makes obtaining a general understanding of this class of materials difficult. “By providing a database, online classifier, and new set of features, our work opens new pathways to the understanding and discovery in this class of materials,” said James Rondinelli, Morris E.

When you pick up a balloon, the pressure to keep hold of it is different from what you would exert to grasp a jar. And now engineers at MIT and elsewhere have a way to precisely measure and map such subtleties of tactile dexterity. The team has designed a new touch-sensing glove that can “feel” pressure and other tactile stimuli. The inside of the glove is threaded with a system of sensors that detects, measures, and maps small changes in pressure across the glove. The individual sensors are highly attuned and can pick up very weak vibrations across the skin, such as from a person’s pulse."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/glove-sensor-pressure-stimuli-0805">[...]</a>

<p><em>"An international team from Delft, Lancaster, Nijmegen, Kiev and Salerno has demonstrated a new technique to generate magnetic waves that propagate through the material at a speed much faster than the speed of sound. These so-called spin waves produce a lot less heat than conventional electric currents, making them promising candidates for future computation devices with significantly reduced power consumption. Physicists and engineers from all around the world are constantly thinking of ways to improve the performance of data processing devices. Many of their ideas revolve around substituting the electrical currents, which carry the signals in conventional electronics, with waves. Waves are coherent excitations, which means that information can be encoded into both the amplitude and the phase of the wave. Interference and diffraction, natural phenomena for a wave of any nature, enable the creation of so-called wave-based logic circuits, the tiny building blocks for future data processing applications."</em> <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/news/researchers-kick-start-magnetic-spin-waves-at-nanoscale-in-pursuit-of-low-energy-computing">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Rochester geophysicists’ latest findings will inform the next generation of moon exploration. In 2024, a new age of space exploration will begin when NASA sends astronauts to the moon as part of their Artemis mission, a follow-up to the Apollo missions of the 1960s and 1970s. Some of the biggest questions that scientists hope to explore include determining what resources are found in the moon’s soil and how those resources might be used to sustain life. In a paper published in the journal Science Advances, researchers at the University of Rochester, leading a team of colleagues at seven other institutions, report their findings on a major factor that influences the types of resources that may be found on the moon: whether or not the moon has had a long-lived magnetic shield at any point in its 4.53 billion-year history. The presence or absence of a shield matters because magnetic shields protect astronomical bodies from harmful solar radiation.

Small changes in membrane design can have a large impact on the performance of a new technology developed at KAUST that uses waste heat from solar cells for seawater desalination. Solar panels can become incredibly hot — more than 40 degrees Celsius warmer than the surrounding air temperature in arid regions. These conditions arise because silicon photovoltaic cells typically convert only one-quarter of absorbed solar energy into electricity while the remainder heats up the cell. Extreme operating temperatures reduce the cell’s efficiency and lifespan even further. In 2019, Peng Wang and his team realized that waste solar-cell heat could be used for water purification."</em> <a href="https://discovery.kaust.edu.sa/en/article/1153/getting-smart-about-off-grid-desalination">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In the U.S., the place where one was born, one’s social and economic background, the neighborhoods in which one spends one’s formative years, and where one grows old are factors that account for a quarter to 60% of deaths in any given year, partly because these forces play a significant role in occurrence and outcomes for heart disease, cancer, unintentional injuries, chronic lower respiratory diseases, and cerebrovascular diseases — the five leading causes of death. While data on such “macro” factors is critical to tracking and predicting health outcomes for individuals and communities, analysts who apply machine-learning tools to health outcomes tend to rely on “micro” data constrained to purely clinical settings and driven by healthcare data and processes inside the hospital, leaving factors that could shed light on healthcare disparities in the dark. Researchers at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering and NYU School of Global Public Health (NYU GPH), in a new perspective, “Machine learning and algorithmic fairness in public and population health,” in Nature Machine Intelligence, aim to activate the machine learning community to account for “macro” factors and their impact on health. Thinking outside the clinical “box” and beyond the strict limits of individual factors, Rumi Chunara, associate professor of computer science and engineering at NYU Tandon and of biostatistics at the NYU GPH, found a new approach to incorporating the larger web of relevant data for predictive modeling for individual and community health outcomes. “Research of what causes and reduces equity shows that to avoid creating more disparities it is essential to consider upstream factors as well,” explained Chunara. She noted, on the one hand, the large body of work on AI and machine learning implementation in healthcare in areas like image analysis, radiography, and pathology, and on the other the strong awareness and advocacy focused on such areas as structural racism, police brutality, and healthcare disparities that came to light around the COVID-19 pandemic."</em> <a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/news/new-research-infuses-equity-principles-algorithm-development-process">[...]</a>

In virtually all matter, lower temperatures mean less movement of its microscopic components.

<p><em>"This tutorial walks through an application that reads/writes data to DDR memory from the Linux userspace on the Zynq-based Arty Z7 FPGA. Story Direct memory access, or DMA as it's referred to, is an important aspect of embedded development as it a method for accessing the embedded system's main memory (typically DDR) without tying up the CPU, therefore leaving it open for performing other operations during the read/write cycle to memory. DMA simply allows for the processor to kick off a transfer to read from/write to the main system memory, then it generates an interrupt indicating the completion of the transfer. Which leaves the processor free to do other tasks until the interrupt calls its respective service routine. While the concept of DMA is straightforward enough, trying to get the full picture in one's mind of how to implement it on an FPGA with embedded processor such as the ARM-core processor in the Xilinx Zynq SoC is no small feat. Then throwing in the extra layer of complexity of how to access it from the userspace of an operating system such as Linux, just makes it even worse."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/whitney-knitter/introduction-to-using-axi-dma-in-embedded-linux-5264ec">[...]</a>

The advantage of using cards instead of the master password is that you don't have to remember even a single character.
