<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1845, o físico polaco <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygmunt_Florenty_Wr%C3%B3blewski">Zygmunt Florenty von Wroblewski</a>. Ele liquefez os "gases permanentes" tais como azoto e monóxido de carbono em maiores quantidades do que as anteriormente realizadas por Cailletet, cujo método ele melhorou. Em 1883, ele conseguiu a liquefacção estática do oxigénio e do ar. Foi o primeiro a liquefazer o hidrogénio. Embora o tenha conseguido apenas numa névoa fina transitória, publicou (1885) dados notavelmente precisos: temperatura crítica 33 K, pressão crítica, 13,3 atm e ponto de ebulição, 23 K (valores modernos 33,3 K, 12,8 atm, 20,3 K).</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1914, o bioquímico britânico <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Laurence_Millington_Synge">Richard Synge</a>. Ele partilhou o Prémio Nobel da Química de 1952 com A.J.P. Martin pelo seu desenvolvimento da cromatografia de partição, nomeadamente a cromatografia em papel. Alguns dos avanços da química necessitam de novos métodos para a separação de várias substâncias. Na cromatografia de papel-filtro, uma gota de uma mistura de substâncias é deixada cair sobre uma tira de papel-filtro, que é autorizada a elaborar um solvente adequado (ex. água com álcool butílico), por acção capilar. A mancha começa a mover-se e, em seguida, gradualmente segrega-se em vários pontos. Algumas manchas seguem rapidamente o solvente, enquanto outras ficam para trás. O resultado é uma resolução da mistura em partes componentes. Uma gota de misturas extremamente complicadas pode ser analisada desta forma simples.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1937, o engenheiro electrotécnico americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcian_Hoff">Marcian Hoff</a>. Ele concebeu o 4004, o primeiro microprocessador comercial do mundo, adaptando a tecnologia de circuito integrado (CI) existente para combinar funções de memória, aritmética e lógica como um computador num único chip de silício. Liderou o projecto na Intel, em conjunto com Stanley Mazor, Masatoshi Shima e Federico Faggin. O 4004 tinha uma ROM de 256 bytes, uma RAM de 32 bits, um registo de deslocamento de 10 bits (uma forma de RAM) e um microprocessador de 4 bits. Tudo num total de 2300 transístores num pacote de 16 pinos. Porque, como um chip, substituiu vários circuitos integrados com fios numa calculadora programável, o 4004 revolucionou a indústria electrónica. Quando lançado em Novembro de 1971, o 4004 tornou possível incluir o processamento de dados em centenas de dispositivos.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1955, o magnata empresarial americano, investidor, autor, e filantropo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates">Bill Gates</a>. Ele foi co-fundador da Microsoft, juntamente com o seu amigo de infância  Paul Allen. Durante a sua carreira na Microsoft, Gates ocupou os cargos de presidente, director executivo (CEO), presidente e arquitecto de software, sendo também o maior accionista individual até Maio de 2014. É considerado um dos empresários mais conhecidos da revolução dos microcomputadores dos anos 70 e 80.</p>

<p>Em 1886 era inaugurada a Estátua da Liberdade, um presente de amizade do povo francês para o povo dos Estados Unidos, é dedicada no porto de Nova Iorque pelo Presidente Grover Cleveland. Originalmente conhecida como "Liberty Enlightening the World", a estátua foi proposta pelo historiador francês Edouard de Laboulaye para comemorar a aliança franco-americana durante a Revolução Americana. Desenhada pelo escultor francês Frederic-Auguste Bartholdi, a estátua de 46 metros tem a forma de uma mulher com um braço erguido segurando uma tocha. A sua estrutura de gigantescos suportes de aço foi concebida por Eugene-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc e Alexandre-Gustave Eiffel, este último famoso pela sua concepção da Torre Eiffel em Paris.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou, a fundação Raspberry PI anunciou uma nova placa a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W. Esta é lançada seis anos após o lançamento da primeira placa Zero. Usando o mesmo form-factor esta placa usa o mesmo processador do Raspberry PI 3 - o Broadcom BCM2710A1 SoC. Vem equipada com 512MB de memória, 2.4GHz IEEE 802.11b/g/n wireless LAN, Bluetooth 4.2, BLE e é lançada a um preço de 15 USD. Este preço reflecte não só as melhorias que a placa introduz relativamente à anterior Zero mas também é fruto das condicionantes que atualmente se sentem no mercado de componentes.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker assim como alguns videos interessantes. É apresentada a revista MagPi nº111 de Novembro.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/new-raspberry-pi-zero-2-w-2/">New product: Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W on sale now at $15</a></h2>

<p><em>"It’s been nearly six years since we unleashed the $5 Raspberry Pi Zero on an unsuspecting world. Of all the products we’ve launched, Zero is still the one I’m proudest of: it most perfectly embodies our mission to give people access to tools, and to eliminate cost as a barrier. We’ve sold nearly four million units of Zero, and its $10 wireless-enabled big brother Zero W, and they’ve made their way into everything from smart speakers to hospital ventilators. But where our larger products have grown steadily more powerful over the years, we’ve never found a way to pack more performance into the Zero form factor. Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W Priced at $15, Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W uses the same Broadcom BCM2710A1 SoC die as the launch version of Raspberry Pi 3, with Arm cores slightly down-clocked to 1GHz, bundled into a single space-saving package alongside 512MB of LPDDR2 SDRAM. The exact performance uplift over Zero varies across workloads, but for multi-threaded sysbench it is almost exactly five times faster."</em> <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/new-raspberry-pi-zero-2-w-2/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"New findings from NASA’s Juno probe orbiting Jupiter provide a fuller picture of how the planet’s distinctive and colorful atmospheric features offer clues about the unseen processes below its clouds. The results highlight the inner workings of the belts and zones of clouds encircling Jupiter, as well as its polar cyclones and even the Great Red Spot. Researchers published several papers on Juno’s atmospheric discoveries today in the journal Science and the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets. Additional papers appeared in two recent issues of Geophysical Research Letters. “These new observations from Juno open up a treasure chest of new information about Jupiter’s enigmatic observable features,” said Lori Glaze, director of NASA’s Planetary Science Division at the agency’s headquarters in Washington. “Each paper sheds light on different aspects of the planet’s atmospheric processes – a wonderful example of how our internationally-diverse science teams strengthen understanding of our solar system.” Juno entered Jupiter’s orbit in 2016."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-juno-science-results-offer-first-3d-view-of-jupiter-atmosphere">[...]</a>

<p><em>"TSMC has introduced its N4P process, a performance-focused enhancement of the foundry's 5nm technology platform. As the third major enhancement of TSMC's 5nm family, N4P will deliver an 11% performance boost over the original N5 technology and a 6% boost over N4, the company indicated. Compared to N5, N4P will also deliver a 22% improvement in power efficiency as well as a 6% improvement in transistor density. In addition, N4P lowers process complexity and improves wafer cycle time by reducing the number of masks, TSMC disclosed. TSMC's N4P process was designed for an easy migration of 5nm platform-based products, which enables customers to not only better maximize their investment but will also deliver faster and more power efficient refreshes to their N5 products, the foundry noted. N4P designs will be well-supported by TSMC's comprehensive design ecosystem for silicon IP and EDA."</em> <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20211026PR202.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Chinese scientists have established a quantum computer prototype named "Jiuzhang 2.0" with 113 detected photons, achieving major breakthroughs in quantum computational speedup. In the study, Gaussian boson sampling (GBS), a classical simulation algorithm, was used to provide a highly efficient way of demonstrating quantum computational speedup in solving some well-defined tasks. With 113 detected photons, "Jiuzhang 2.0" can implement large-scale GBS septillion times faster than the world's fastest existing supercomputer and 10 billion times faster than its earlier version, "Jiuzhang." In a nutshell, it would take the fastest supercomputer about 30 trillion years to solve a problem that "Jiuzhang 2.0" can solve in just one millisecond. The study, led by the renowned Chinese quantum physicist Pan Jianwei, was published online in the journal Physical Review Letters on Monday Beijing Time. Inspired by the concept of light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation (LASER), the team developed a stimulated squeezed light source with high brightness and simultaneously near-unity purity and efficiency for scalable GBS."</em> <a href="http://www.news.cn/english/2021-10/26/c_1310270058.htm">[...]</a>

The research is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. “Today’s shape-shifting materials and structures can only transition between a few stable configurations but we have shown how to create structural materials that have an arbitrary range of shape-morphing capabilities,” said L Mahadevan, the Lola England de Valpine Professor of Applied Mathematics, of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, and of Physics and senior author of the paper. “These structures allow for independent control of the geometry and mechanics, laying the foundation for engineering functional shapes using a new type of morphable unit cell.” One of the biggest challenges in designing shape-morphing materials is balancing the seemingly contradictory needs of conformability and rigidity. Conformability enables transformation to new shapes but if it's too conformal, it can’t stably maintain the shapes. Rigidity helps lock the material into place but if it's too rigid, it can’t take on new shapes."</em> <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2021/10/shape-shifting-materials-infinite-possibilities">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Cracked phone screens could become a thing of the past thanks to breakthrough research conducted at The University of Queensland. The global team of researchers, led by UQ’s Dr Jingwei Hou, Professor Lianzhou Wang and Professor Vicki Chen, have unlocked the technology to produce next-generation composite glass for lighting LEDs and smartphone, television and computer screens. The findings will enable the manufacture of glass screens that are not only unbreakable but also deliver crystal clear image quality. Dr Hou said the discovery was a huge step forward in perovskite nanocrystal technology as previously, researchers were only able to produce this technology in the bone-dry atmosphere of a laboratory setting. “The emitting materials are made from nanocrystals, called lead-halide perovskites,” he said. “They can harvest sunlight and concert it into renewable electricity - playing a vital role in low-cost and high-efficiency new generation solar cells and many promising applications like lighting."</em> <a href="https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2021/10/uq-research-unlocks-technology-produce-unbreakable-screens">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers have developed a fast and energy-efficient laser-writing method for producing high-density nanostructures in silica glass. These tiny structures can be used for long-term five-dimensional (5D) optical data storage that is more than 10,000 times denser than Blue-Ray optical disc storage technology. “Individuals and organizations are generating ever-larger datasets, creating the desperate need for more efficient forms of data storage with a high capacity, low energy consumption and long lifetime,” said doctoral researcher Yuhao Lei from the University of Southampton in the UK. “While cloud-based systems are designed more for temporary data, we believe that 5D data storage in glass could be useful for longer-term data storage for national archives, museums, libraries or private organizations.” In Optica, Optica Publishing Group’s journal for high-impact research, Lei and colleagues describe their new method for writing data that encompasses two optical dimensions plus three spatial dimensions. The new approach can write at speeds of 1,000,000 voxels per second, which is equivalent to recording about 230 kilobytes of data (more than 100 pages of text) per second. “The physical mechanism we use is generic,” said Lei."</em> <a href="https://www.osa.org/en-us/about/newsroom/news_releases/2021/high-speed_laser_writing_method_could_pack_500_ter/">[...]</a>

A few years ago, after taking my first contacts with embedded electronics, I decided it would be time to try building a Tricorder. My first option was to use arduino. I'm definitely not an expert, so I designed my project based much more on concepts like; Sketch simplicity, ease of assembly and possibility of miniaturization. I am aware that an expert can design something much more efficiently. Initially, I built Tricorduino 1.0 and 2.0, using arduino mega and some sensors."</em> <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/182273-tricorduino-30-true-scientific-tricorder">[...]</a>
