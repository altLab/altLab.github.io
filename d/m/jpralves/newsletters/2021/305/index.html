<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1854, o meteorologista inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napier_Shaw">Napier Shaw</a>. Ele estudou a alta atmosfera, usando instrumentos carregados por pipas e balões de alta altitude. Ele mediu o movimento do ar em dois anticiclones, encontrando rácios descendentes de 350 e 450 metros por dia. Ele introduziu a unidade de milibares para medir a pressão do ar (1000 milibares = 1 bar = 1 atmosfera padrão) e o tefigrama para ilustrar a temperatura de um perfil vertical da atmosfera. Ele também foi co-autor de um dos primeiros trabalhos sobre poluição atmosférica, The Smoke Problem of Great Cities (1925).</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1859, o Físico e engenheiro electrotécnico russo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Stepanovich_Popov">Alexander Stepanovich Popov</a>. Ele foi aclamado na Russia como o inventor do Radio. Ao saber do trabalho de Hertz, em 1895 Popov construiu um aparelho que podia registar distúrbios eléctricos causados por raios. Ele aplicou-o para receber sinais feitos pelo homem. Em 1896, ele demonstrou um sistema de radio-telégrafo que transmitia código Morse. Em Fevereiro de 1904, Popov demonstrou pela primeira vez a transmissão de rádio da voz humana. A sua invenção foi usada pela primeira vez pela marinha russa. No entanto, a primeira fábrica de rádios da Rússia foi estabelecida pela empresa Marconi.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1862, o Astrofísico e matemático suíço <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Emden">Robert Emden</a>. Ele escreveu Gaskugeln (Gas Spheres, 1907), dando um modelo matemático de estrutura estelar como a expansão e compressão de esferas de gás, em que as forças de gravidade e pressão do gás estão em equilíbrio. Ele expandiu o trabalho anterior de J. H. Lane (1869) e A. Ritter (1878-83), que primeiro derivou equações que descrevem estrelas como substâncias químicas gasosas, corpos esféricos mantidos juntos por sua própria gravidade e obedecendo às leis dos gases conhecidas da termodinâmica. Por quatro décadas, a equação de Lane-Emden foi a base do trabalho teórico sobre a estrutura das estrelas: as suas temperaturas e pressões centrais, massas e equilíbrios.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1877, o inventor e empresário norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrett_Morgan">Garrett Morgan</a>. Ele inventou um creme para alisar o cabelo, uma embraiagem de automóvel, um dispositivo de respiração com capuz de segurança (1912) que ele aperfeiçoou como uma máscara de gás usada por alguns soldados na primeira Guerra Mundial, e um semáforo de trânsito. Quando ele inventou um semáforo em 1922 (não do tipo vermelho-amarelo-verde), vários outros semáforos já tinham sido patenteados por outros inventores.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1904, o Físico nuclear, cosmólogo e escritor americano nascido na Rússia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gamow">George Gamow</a>. Ele foi um dos principais defensores da teoria do Big Bang, que descreve a origem do universo como uma explosão colossal ocorrida há biliões de anos. Em 1954, ele expandiu os seus interesses em bioquímica e seu trabalho com ácido desoxirribonucleico (DNA) deu uma contribuição básica para a teoria genética moderna.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1922, o cientista da computação inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Tootill">Geoff Tootill</a>. Ele, com Tom Kilburn, juntou-se ao projecto de Frederick Williams para projectar uma memória de computador. Para testar a memória, um computador apelidado de "Baby" foi construído, que foi o primeiro computador do mundo com programas armazenados. A máquina usava um novo método para armazenar até 32 instruções ou números num visor de tubo de raios catódicos. A 21 de Junho de 1948, ele terminou seu primeiro teste bem-sucedido, gastando 52 minutos e cerca de três milhões e meio de operações aritméticas, para encontrar o factor adequado mais alto de 2^18.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que a SpaceX finalmente teve um sucesso com a aterragem do seu prototipo de foguetão Starship. Tendo manobrado correctamente até à Terra, este sucesso acaba por ser agridoce uma vez que passado cerca de 8 minutos do foguetão ter aterrado dá-se uma explosão que destroi completamente.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker assim como alguns videos interessantes. É apresentada a revista newelectronics de 23 de Fevereiro e o livro "Introduction to Scientific Programming with Python".</p>

<p><em>"SpaceX's latest Starship prototype went out in a blaze of glory. The Starship SN10 spacecraft touched down successfully after a high-altitude test flight today (March 3), a major milestone for the company and its crewed Mars ambitions. But the vehicle didn't manage to hold itself together, exploding about eight minutes after landing. The big stainless-steel SN10 (short for "Serial No. 10") launched from SpaceX's South Texas site at 6:15 p.m. EST (2315 GMT), rose 6.2 miles (10 kilometers) into the sky and then came back to Earth for a smooth touchdown 6 minutes and 20 seconds after liftoff. It was the third high-altitude test flight for a Starship vehicle but the first to feature a successful landing."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-starship-sn10-test-launch-landing-explosion">[...]</a>

<p><em>"China’s Huawei plans to make electric vehicles under its own brand and could launch some models this year, four sources said, as the world’s largest telecommunications equipment maker, battered by U.S. sanctions, explores a strategic shift. Huawei Technologies Co Ltd is in talks with state-owned Changan Automobile and other automakers to use their car plants to make its electric vehicles (EVs), according to two of the people familiar with the matter. Huawei is also in discussions with Beijing-backed BAIC Group’s BluePark New Energy Technology to manufacture its EVs, said one of the two and a separate person with direct knowledge of the matter. The plan heralds a potentially major shift in direction for Huawei after nearly two-years of U.S. sanctions that have cut its access to key supply chains, forcing it to sell a part of its smartphone business to keep the brand alive. Huawei was placed on a trade blacklist by the Trump administration over national security concerns. Many industry executives see little chance that blocks on the sale of billions of dollars of U.S. technology and chips to the Chinese company, which has denied wrongdoing, will be reversed by his successor."</em> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-huawei-electric-exclusive/exclusive-chinas-huawei-reeling-from-u-s-sanctions-plans-foray-into-evs-sources-idUSKBN2AQ0KD">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Construction of the prototype city of the future where all ecosystems are connected begins at the Higashi-Fuji site (Susono City, Shizuoka Prefecture) Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota) and Woven Planet Holdings, Inc. (Woven Planet), the Toyota Group company responsible for a wide range of mobility development projects, anchored in software, held a groundbreaking ceremony (Jichinsai) for the construction of Woven City at 11:00 a.m. on February 23 at the old vehicle yard adjacent to the former Higashi-Fuji Plant site of Toyota Motor East Japan, Inc. (TMEJ). Along with Governor Heita Kawakatsu of Shizuoka Prefecture, Mayor Kenji Takamura of Susono City, and other guests representing the local community, the ceremony was attended by Toyota President Akio Toyoda, Woven Planet CEO James Kuffner, TMEJ President Kazuhiro Miyauchi, as well as others involved in the project. Together, the leaders expressed their hopes for the safe start to construction. "The Woven City project officially starts today," said President Toyoda. "Taking action as one has decided is never an easy task. I must express my deepest gratitude to all who have provided their whole-hearted support and cooperation to the project through today."</em> <a href="https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/34827717.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The Arduino IDE is the well-known software we all use to program our boards. Its development started in 2005 based on the graphical interface of the Processing project and has never stopped since. During these years, countless hours of development by the Arduino team with the help of a vibrant community made the Arduino IDE the de facto standard for electronics prototyping. Thanks to an extensible framework based on modular board support packages, the IDE supports more than 1,000 official and non-official boards; it’s translated in 66 languages, mentioned by more than 3,000 books, and is still growing: during the last year, it was downloaded more than 39 millions of times. More than ever. First off, a big thank you to the Arduino community that makes development possible with donations and — even more important — by buying original Arduino boards: we use your money to pay the developers that work daily on the Arduino open source software for the benefit of everyone."</em> <a href="https://blog.arduino.cc/2021/03/01/announcing-the-arduino-ide-2-0-beta/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Relativity Space, the 3D-printing rocket builder, is making another big bet: Developing a fully reusable rocket, designed to match the power and capability of SpaceX’s workhorse Falcon 9 rockets. Called Terran R, the reusable rocket is “really an obvious evolution” from the company’s Terran 1 rocket, Relativity CEO Tim Ellis told CNBC – the latter of which Relativity expects to launch for the first time later in 2021. “It’s the same architecture, the same propellant, the same factory, the same 3D printers, the same avionics and the same team,” Ellis said. “I’ve always been a huge fan of reusability. No matter how you look at it – even with 3D printing, and dropping the cost, and [increasing the] automation of a launch vehicle – making it reusable has got to be part of that future,” Ellis added. Terran R is the first of several new initiatives that Ellis expects Relativity to unveil in the year ahead, with the company having raised more than $680 million since its founding five years ago."</em> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/25/relativitys-reusable-terran-rocket-competitor-to-spacexs-falcon-9.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"China’s Mars orbiter has beamed back high-resolution images, revealing geographic features of the red planet in detail. The photos taken by Tianwen-1 come a week after the United States released a panorama of the Martian surface snapped by the rover Perseverance. They also come as China prepares to unveil a new five-year plan centred on science and hi-tech innovation, with aerospace technology expected to be a priority programme. Chinese mission spokesman Liu Tongjie told state television that two of the orbiter’s images were snapped at an altitude of about 330km (205 miles) and had a resolution down to 70cm (27 inches), revealing fine details of the Martian landscape. “These two pictures clearly show craters, mountain ridges and dunes,” said Liu, from the China National Space Administration. “One image shows a crater with a diameter of about 620 metres and clearly displays the lines at the bottom of the crater.” A colour photo was taken of the northern polar region at an altitude of 5,000km."</em> <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3124082/chinas-tianwen-1-zooms-mars-surface-cusp-new-tech-era">[...]</a>

The life-hunting robot will also help a little bit of Mars make it to Earth a decade or so from now, if all goes according to plan. Perseverance, the centerpiece of NASA's $2.7 billion Mars 2020 mission, touched down inside the Red Planet's Jezero Crater on Feb. 18, 2021. Once it's fully up and running, the car-sized robot will search for evidence of past microbial life and collect several dozen samples for future return to Earth, among other ambitious tasks. "I don't think we've had a mission that is going to contribute so much to both science and technology," NASA Acting Administrator Steve Jurczyk told Space.com shortly before Perseverance touched down."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/perseverance-rover-mars-2020-mission">[...]</a>

<p><em>"SpaceX has launched another batch of its Starlink satellites — the usual complement of 60 of the low Earth orbit spacecraft, which will join the more than 1,000 already making up the existing constellation. This is the fifth launch of Starlink satellites for SpaceX this year, and the twentieth overall. Earlier this year, SpaceX opened up Starlink access to anyone in a current or planned service area via a pre-order reservation system with a refundable up-front deposit. The company aims to continue launches like this one apace throughout 2021 in order to get the constellation to the point where it can serve customers over a much larger portion of the globe.

The image sensor on a smartphone camera is responsible for taking the light that enters through the camera’s lens and producing an image from it, with the size of the sensor and the number of light capturing ‘pixels’ the sensor contains determining the quality of the digital image that is produced. However, as an increasing number of pixels are incorporated into smartphone image sensors that must, by their nature, be small, a phenomenon called color crosstalk that involves light bleed between neighboring pixels can occur.

The method, demonstrated in a paper published in Optica, could help lay the groundwork for when a large number of quantum computers, quantum sensors and other quantum technology are ready to go online and communicate with each other. The team deployed a programmable switch to adjust how much data goes to each user by selecting and redirecting wavelengths of light carrying the different data channels, making it possible to increase the number of users without adding to photon loss as the network gets bigger. If photons are lost, quantum information is lost – a problem that tends to happen the farther photons have to travel through fiber optic networks. “We show a way to do wavelength routing with just one piece of equipment – a wavelength-selective switch – to, in principle, build a network of 12 to 20 users, maybe even more,” said Andrew Weiner, Purdue’s Scifres Family Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering."</em> <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2021/Q1/a-quantum-internet-is-closer-to-reality,-thanks-to-this-switch.html">[...]</a>

In response, scientists have been trying out a process that can sequester waste carbon dioxide, transporting it into a storage site, and then depositing it at a place where it cannot enter the atmosphere. The problem is that capturing carbon from power plants and industrial emissions isn’t very cost-effective.

<p><em>"Catalyst nanoparticles trap an unprecedented range of wavelengths of light to convert carbon dioxide into methane. Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) is a major driver of global warming, but this gas could also serve as a valuable resource. Researchers at KAUST have developed an efficient catalyst that uses light energy to convert CO2 and hydrogen into methane (CH4). This counteracts the release of CO2 when methane is burned as a fuel. Many researchers worldwide are exploring ways to convert CO2 into useful carbon-based chemicals, but their efforts have been limited by low efficiencies that restrict the potential for large-scale application. “Our approach is based on the synergistic combination of light and heat, known as the photothermal effect,” says postdoc Diego Mateo."</em> <a href="https://discovery.kaust.edu.sa/en/article/1078/hot-electrons-send-co2-back-to-the-future">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A strategy for preventing boron-containing compounds from breaking down could help medicinal chemists design new drugs. Boron, a metalloid element that sits next to carbon in the periodic table, has many traits that make it potentially useful as a drug component. Nonetheless, only five FDA-approved drugs contain boron, largely because molecules that contain boron are unstable in the presence of molecular oxygen. MIT chemists have now designed a boron-containing chemical group that is 10,000 times more stable than its predecessors. This could make it possible to incorporate boron into drugs and potentially improve the drugs’ ability to bind their targets, the researchers say. “It’s an entity that medicinal chemists can add to compounds they’re interested in, to provide desirable attributes that no other molecule will have,” says Ron Raines, the Firmenich Professor of Chemistry at MIT and the senior author of the new study."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/chemists-boost-borons-utility-0302">[...]</a>

The research, published recently in the American Chemical Society journal Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces, addresses an underappreciated problem in engineering: Friction. Yifu Ding, senior author of the new paper, explained that every day, machines from robots to cars lose tremendous amounts of energy simply because their parts rub together. To try to reduce that loss, he and his colleagues took cues from nature—specifically, its most slithery members. “A snake’s body is soft enough that it can twist itself into all kinds of shapes,” said Ding, a professor in the Paul M. Rady Department of Mechanical Engineering. “It can also move really fast if it needs to, in part because its skin has such low friction.” In their latest study, the researchers developed a tool called solid-liquid interfacial polymerization (SLIP) that allows them to lay a thin layer of skin onto existing surfaces like rubber or stretchy materials called elastomers."</em> <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/today/2021/03/02/snakeskin-inspires-new-friction-reducing-material">[...]</a>

That is, the OLEDs are fabricated on to temporary tattoo paper and transferred to a new surface by being pressed on to it and dabbed with water. The researchers, who described the process in a new paper in the journal Advanced Electronic Materials, say it could be combined with other tattoo electronics to, for instance emit light when an athlete is dehydrated, or when we need to get out of the sun to avoid sunburn. OLEDs could be tattooed on packaging or fruit to signal when a product has passed its expiry date or will soon become inedible, or used for fashion in the form of glowing tattoos.

<p><em>"Laser-cooled plasma-in-a-bottle could answer questions about the sun, fusion power Rice University physicists have discovered a way to trap the world’s coldest plasma in a magnetic bottle, a technological achievement that could advance research into clean energy, space weather and astrophysics. “To understand how the solar wind interacts with the Earth, or to generate clean energy from nuclear fusion, one has to understand how plasma — a soup of electrons and ions — behaves in a magnetic field,” said Rice Dean of Natural Sciences Tom Killian, the corresponding author of a published study about the work in Physical Review Letters. Using laser-cooled strontium, Killian and graduate students Grant Gorman and MacKenzie Warrens made a plasma about 1 degree above absolute zero, or approximately -272 degrees Celsius, and trapped it briefly with forces from surrounding magnets. It is the first time an ultracold plasma has been magnetically confined, and Killian, who’s studied ultracold plasmas for more than two decades, said it opens the door for studying plasmas in many settings. “This provides a clean and controllable testbed for studying neutral plasmas in far more complex locations, like the sun’s atmosphere or white dwarf stars,” said Killian, a professor of physics and astronomy. “It’s really helpful to have the plasma so cold and to have these very clean laboratory systems."</em> <a href="https://news.rice.edu/2021/03/01/bottling-the-worlds-coldest-plasma-2/">[...]</a>

In recent years, engineers have found ways to modify the properties of some “two- dimensional” materials, which are just one or a few atoms thick, by stacking two layers together and rotating one slightly in relation to the other. This creates what are known as moiré patterns, where tiny shifts in the alignment of atoms between the two sheets create larger-scale patterns. It also changes the way electrons move through the material, in potentially useful ways. But for practical applications, such two-dimensional materials must at some point connect with the ordinary world of 3D materials. An international team led by MIT researchers has now come up with a way of imaging what goes on at these interfaces, down to the level of individual atoms, and of correlating the moiré patterns at the 2D-3D boundary with the resulting changes in the material’s properties."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/2d-3d-materials-electronic-microscope-0226">[...]</a>

In addition to observing the geometry of objects, their chirality can also be distinguished by the interaction of light with matter. For example, the detection of circular dichroism spectra can be achieved by studying the different optical response of structures to left and right spin circularly polarized light through the interaction of photon spin angular momentum with matter.

IoT encourages companies to rethink the ways they approach their businesses and gives them the tools to improve their business strategies. There are numerous real-world applications of the internet of things, ranging from consumer IoT and enterprise IoT to manufacturing and industrial IoT (IIoT). IoT applications span numerous verticals, including automotive, telecom and energy. One area that will be crucial going forward is the ability to understand how IoT and IIoT will eventually merge. In the below example we try demonstrating one such example where we try to put together the world of IoT and IIoT."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/sid18/multiple-iot-device-communication-on-esp32-a3ee4a">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This is a really simple build made up of essentially 3 components and some fun coding with nested loops to translate audio amplitude data into colorful displays; An Arduino (I used an Uno but any Arduino with at least 2 analog inputs should work) Arduino Audio Spectrum Shield, 2x MSGEQ7, 3.5mm Jacks + 3-pin In Some number of WS2812 individually addressable LED strips. I used 7 strips, 1 meter long each, 30 LEDs each The Audio Spectrum shield has a 3.5mm jack for stereo input and another to pass the audio through to the output. It has 2 chips (one for each channel) that split the audio signal into 7 frequency bands. Code in the Arduino "strobes" a digital pin to cycle through the 7 channels and reads the left and right analog value using 2 analog inputs on the Arduino and stores them in a "left" and "right" array. There's a good tutorial at SparkFun on the board with some good example code which doesn't need the LED strips; https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/spectrum-shield-hookup-guide-v2 Within the Arduino "loop" you call the function to read those values and do some interesting processing to put values into an "leds" array and then use the FastLED library to "show" the LEDs. This happens about 100 times per second unless you insert some delay."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Audio-Spectrum-Shield-WS2812-LED-Display/">[...]</a>
