<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1901, o matemático polaco-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Tarski">Alfred Tarski</a>. Ele foi responsável por estudos importantes de álgebra geral, teoria da medida, lógica matemática, teoria dos conjuntos e meta-matemática. As linguagens científicas formais podem ser submetidas a um estudo mais completo pelo método semântico que ele desenvolveu. Ele trabalhou em teoria de modelos, problemas de decisão matemática e álgebra universal. Ele produziu axiomas para “consequência lógica”, trabalhou em sistemas dedutivos, a álgebra da lógica e a teoria da definibilidade. Os teóricos de grupo estudam “monstros Tarski”, grupos infinitos cuja existência parece intuitivamente impossível.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje 15 anos que a sonda espacial Huygens pousou em Titã, a maior lua de Saturno. Ele tinha sido libertada da nave Cassini quando a sua órbita a volta de Saturno convergiu com a trajectória de Titã a 24 de Dezembro de 2004. Nas primeiras três fotografias recebidas de Huygens na superfície de Titã, os cientistas viram o que se assemelhava a canais de drenagem, uma linha costeira, regiões inundadas cercadas por terreno elevado e uma planície coberta por grandes rochas, possivelmente de gelo. A sonda foi baptizada em homenagem a Christiaan Huygens, o astrónomo holandês que viu Titã pela primeira vez em 25 de Março de 1655, a primeira lua de Saturno a ser descoberta.</p>

<p>Nesta semana já se passaram 3.000 dias marcianos, ou sóis, desde que Curiosity pousou em Marte a 6 de Agosto de 2012, e o rover continua a fazer novas descobertas durante sua escalada gradual até o Monte Sharp, de 5 quilómetros de altura, a montanha que tem vindo a explorar desde 2014. Os geólogos ficaram intrigados ao ver uma série de “bancos” de rocha no panorama mais recente da missão.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana foi decidido pela NASA abandonar definitivamente a missão da sonda Insight de perfurar a superfície de Marte. Não tendo conseguido obter o atrito de que precisa para cavar, vai ser atribuída outra missão a esta sonda. Sendo um veiculo estacionário, ela não se consegue mover da posição onde aterrou e isto tornou ainda mais difícil esta missão.</p>

<p>Ainda esta semana foi anunciada conjuntamente pela Seeed e pela Beaglebone uma parceria com a líder de soluções RISC-V, StarFive, para criar o mais recente membro da série BeagleBoard.org, o BeagleV. BeagleV é a primeira placa RISC V acessível - projectada para correr Linux. A BeagleV, leva o código aberto para o próximo nível dando aos programadores mais liberdade e poder para inovar e projectar soluções líderes da indústria com um preço inicial acessível de cerca de 149 USD, que se seguirá com variantes de menor custo em lançamentos subsequentes.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos assim como projetos de maker. É apresentado o livro "Algorithms for Decision Making".</p>

<p><em>"As the rover has continued to ascend Mount Sharp, it’s found distinctive benchlike rock formations. It’s been 3,000 Martian days, or sols, since Curiosity touched down on Mars on Aug. 6, 2012, and the rover keeps making new discoveries during its gradual climb up Mount Sharp, the 3-mile-tall (5-kilometer-tall) mountain it has been exploring since 2014. Geologists were intrigued to see a series of rock “benches” in the most recent panorama from the mission. Stitched together from 122 images taken on Nov. 18, 2020, the mission’s 2,946th sol, the panorama was captured by the Mast Camera, or Mastcam, which serves as the rover’s main “eyes.” Toward the center of the panorama is the floor of Gale Crater, the 96-mile-wide (154 kilometer-wide) bowl that Mount Sharp sits within. On the horizon is the north crater rim. To the right is the upper part of Mount Sharp, which has rock layers that were shaped by lakes and streams billions of years ago."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-curiosity-rover-reaches-its-3000th-day-on-mars/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The heat probe hasn’t been able to gain the friction it needs to dig, but the mission has been granted an extension to carry on with its other science. The heat probe developed and built by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and deployed on Mars by NASA’s InSight lander has ended its portion of the mission. Since Feb. 28, 2019, the probe, called the “mole,” has been attempting to burrow into the Martian surface to take the planet’s internal temperature, providing details about the interior heat engine that drives the Mars’ evolution and geology. But the soil’s unexpected tendency to clump deprived the spike-like mole of the friction it needs to hammer itself to a sufficient depth. After getting the top of the mole about 2 or 3 centimeters under the surface, the team tried one last time to use a scoop on InSight’s robotic arm to scrape soil onto the probe and tamp it down to provide added friction. After the probe conducted 500 additional hammer strokes on Saturday, Jan. 9, with no progress, the team called an end to their efforts."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasa-insights-mole-ends-its-journey-on-mars/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Using copper foil, glass containers and a conventional household microwave oven, University of Wyoming researchers have demonstrated that pulverized coal powder can be converted into higher-value nano-graphite. The discovery is another step forward in the effort to find alternative uses for Wyoming’s Powder River Basin coal, at a time when demand for coal to generate electricity is declining due to concerns about climate change. In a paper published in the journal Nano-Structures &amp; Nano-Objects, the UW researchers report that they created an environment in a microwave oven to successfully convert raw coal powder into nano-graphite, which is used as a lubricant and in items ranging from fire extinguishers to lithium ion batteries. This “one-step method with metal-assisted microwave treatment” is a new approach that could represent a simple and relatively inexpensive coal-conversion technology. “This method provides a new route to convert abundant carbon sources to high-value materials with ecological and economic benefits,” wrote the research team, led by Associate Professor TeYu Chien, in UW’s Department of Physics and Astronomy.

<p><em>"A team of researchers in China has demonstrated an integrated space-to-ground quantum communication network that combines a large-scale fiber network of more than 700 fiber links and two high-speed satellite-to-ground free-space links. “Quantum key distribution (QKD) uses the quantum states of particles to form a string of zeros and ones, while any eavesdropping between the sender and the receiver will change this string or key and be noticed immediately,” said Professor Jianwei Pan from the University of Science and Technology of China and colleagues. “QKD has the potential to enable secure communication and information transfer.” “In the laboratory, the feasibility of point-to-point QKD is evident from the early proof-of-concept demonstration in the laboratory over 32 cm. This distance was later extended to the 100-km scale with decoy-state QKD and more recently to the 500-km scale with measurement-device-independent QKD.” “Several small-scale QKD networks were also tested outside the laboratory. However, a global QKD network requires a practically — not just theoretically — secure and reliable QKD network that can be used by a large number of users distributed over a wide area.” In 2016, China launched the world’s first quantum communication satellite — the Quantum Experiments at Space Scale (QUESS), or Mozi/Micius — and achieved QKD with two ground stations which are 2,600 km apart.

This material achieves a metal-like ultrahigh free-carrier concentration that leads to strong and tunable plasmonic field. Plasmonic materials are widely used in the fields including microscopy, sensing, optical computing and photovoltaics. Most common plasmonic materials are gold and silver.

An atom-thin layer of semiconductor antimony paired with ferroelectric indium selenide would display unique properties depending on the side and polarization by an external electric field. The field could be used to stabilize indium selenide’s polarization, a long-sought property that tends to be wrecked by internal fields in materials like perovskites but would be highly useful for solar energy applications. Calculations by Rice materials theorist Boris Yakobson, lead author and researcher Jun-Jie Zhang and graduate student Dongyang Zhu shows switching the material’s polarization with an external electric field makes it either a simple insulator with a band gap suitable for visible light absorption or a topological insulator, a material that only conducts electrons along its surface. Turning the field inward would make the material good for solar panels. Turning it outward could make it useful as a spintronic device for quantum computing."</em> <a href="https://news.rice.edu/2021/01/11/2d-compound-shows-unique-versatility-2/">[...]</a>

Gravitational waves were first theorized by Albert Einstein in 1916, but they weren't directly detected until nearly a century later.

Now, a team that includes Stanford computer scientist Mary Wootters and electrical engineer H.-S. Philip Wong has designed a system that can run AI tasks faster, and with less energy, by harnessing eight hybrid chips, each with its own data processor built right next to its own memory storage. This paper builds on the team’s prior development of a new memory technology, called RRAM, that stores data even when power is switched off – like flash memory – only faster and more energy efficiently."</em> <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2021/01/11/hybrid-chips-can-run-ai-battery-powered-devices/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"We are fascinated by machines that can control cars, compose symphonies, or defeat people at chess, Go, or Jeopardy! While more progress is being made all the time in Artificial Intelligence (AI), some scientists and philosophers warn of the dangers of an uncontrollable superintelligent AI. Using theoretical calculations, an international team of researchers, including scientists from the Center for Humans and Machines at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, shows that it would not be possible to control a superintelligent AI. The study was published in the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research. Suppose someone were to program an AI system with intelligence superior to that of humans, so it could learn independently. Connected to the Internet, the AI may have access to all the data of humanity."</em> <a href="https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/computer-science-superintelligent-machines">[...]</a>

<p><em>"To perform calculations, quantum computers need qubits to act as elementary building blocks that process and store information. Now, physicists have produced a new type of qubit that can be switched from a stable idle mode to a fast calculation mode. The concept would also allow a large number of qubits to be combined into a powerful quantum computer, as researchers from the University of Basel and TU Eindhoven have reported in the journal “Nature Nanotechnology”. Compared with conventional bits, quantum bits (qubits) are much more fragile and can lose their information content very quickly. The challenge for quantum computing is therefore to keep the sensitive qubits stable over a prolonged period of time, while at the same time finding ways to perform rapid quantum operations. Now, physicists from the University of Basel and TU Eindhoven have developed a switchable qubit that should allow quantum computers to do both."</em> <a href="https://www.unibas.ch/en/News-Events/News/Uni-Research/Electrically-switchable-qubit-can-tune-between-storage-and-fast-calculation-modes.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Study shows improvements to chemical sensing chip that aims to quickly and accurately identify drugs and other trace chemicals University at Buffalo researchers are reporting an advancement of a chemical sensing chip that could lead to handheld devices that detect trace chemicals — everything from illicit drugs to pollution — as quickly as a breathalyzer identifies alcohol. The chip, which also may have uses in food safety monitoring, anti-counterfeiting and other fields where trace chemicals are analyzed, is described in a study that appears on the cover of the Dec. 17 edition of the journal Advanced Optical Materials. “There is a great need for portable and cost-effective chemical sensors in many areas, especially drug abuse,” says the study’s lead author Qiaoqiang Gan, PhD, professor of electrical engineering in the UB School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. The work builds upon previous research Gan’s lab led that involved creating a chip that traps light at the edges of gold and silver nanoparticles. When biological or chemical molecules land on the chip’s surface, some of the captured light interacts with the molecules and is “scattered” into light of new energies. This effect occurs in recognizable patterns that act as fingerprints of chemical or biological molecules, revealing information about what compounds are present."</em> <a href="http://engineering.buffalo.edu/ee/research/press-releases/gan-quantum-limit-approaching-chip.html">[...]</a>

Even though we do not need handwriting or typing nowadays for taking notes or setting appointment reminders thanks to umpteen web and mobile applications, I am still fond of writing down my records on paper like in the old days :) Thus, I decided to create this project, which allows me to benefit from the advantages of an application while taking my notes and reminders on paper. Instead of programming a web and mobile application from scratch to send commands to my thermal printer, I wanted to use Telegram, a cross-platform cloud-based messaging service compatible with iOS and Android. In Telegram, it is effortless to create bots with a command list unalike any other messaging applications, which are special accounts that do not require an additional phone number to set up. IoT Thermal Printer, Telegram bot I created for this project, let me print records in six different categories I need frequently: - Notes (Appointments) - Shopping Lists - URLs - Payments - Product Barcodes (Manufacturer Product Numbers) - Series (New Episode Release Dates) To fetch commands transferred by IoT Thermal Printer, I developed an outgoing webhook for the Telegram bot, which interprets and replies commands or texts when updated by the Telegram Bot API.

So I decided to make my own, which meets all the requirements above and more. Here are some features of my kit: It uses custom black PCBs; to make it look nicer, I used surface-mounted components placing most components on the back contains 5 types of gates (AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOT) plus a separate 3-bit input board is powered through USB-C connector each board is relatively large - 48x72mm - only slightly smaller than a credit card, with high contrast white on black marking and bright blue LED to indicate states boards are connected by a common 3-wire connectors, commonly used for servos and widely available boards have stick-on magnets on the back, allowing one to place them on a magnetic whiteboard or blackboard or any other magnetic surface - even refrigerator door!

<h2><a href="http://www.righto.com/2021/01/reverse-engineering-low-power-led.html">Reverse-engineering a low-power LED flasher chip</a></h2>

<p><em>"How do you make an LED blink? A vintage way is the LM3909, a chip from 1975 that can flash an LED for a year from a single flashlight battery. This chip has some surprising features, such as a charge pump that lets you power a 2-volt LED from a 1.5-volt battery. This IC was designed for simplicity, using just an LED, external capacitor, and battery. In this blog post, I reverse-engineer its silicon die. The photo below (from Zeptobars) shows the die under a microscope."</em> <a href="http://www.righto.com/2021/01/reverse-engineering-low-power-led.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"How I used a microcontroller, a fan, and a bunch of sensors to create a smart filtration system. I was thinking of projects to work on, and I thought, gee, it would be nice if our 3D printer didn’t kill us 1. I had researched the potential health side effects of owning a 3D printer when I bought it - it turns out they can malfunction and catch fire or release harmful chemicals into the air - but I made excuses. I’m only printing in Polyactic Acid (PLA), one of the least harmful filaments - it’s probably fine. Sure, maybe it releases some tiny plastic into the air, but it’s a big room, and sometimes I keep the windows open. Our smoke detectors are brand new and well tested."</em> <a href="https://mikebuss.com/2021/01/06/3d-printer-filtration/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"When Microchip bought Atmel I was afraid that they would discontinue further development of the AVR MCUs and instead only promote their PIC-devices. But it seems this worry was unjustified. New series of ATtinies and ATmegas have been released and these new devices are packed with very useful periferals. At the same time the price of the newer devices are substantially lower than the older ones. Of particular interest to me is the Event System and the Configurable Custom Logic (CCL) block that makes it possible to route signals between peripherals and pins without having to go through any CPU processing. This opens up for applications like software configurable switch-mode regulators for voltage translation (step-up/boost, step-down/buck, flyback etc.)."</em> <a href="https://sm6vfz.wordpress.com/2020/12/11/boost-regulator-with-attiny/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The project shown here is a cheap 60W LED dimmer for 12V LEDs/12V LED strips. The circuit is based on the very popular, versatile, and low-cost 555 timer IC, NE555 IC generates a PWM signal and IRF540 MOSFET works as output driver for the LEDs. In this circuit the 555 IC used in an astable multivibrator configuration to generate the PWM, by controlling the charging and discharging of the timing of capacitor C3, using D2, D3 and PR1. Potentiometer R7 is provided to control the intensity of LED connected to connector CN2, Connector CN1 provided to power the project with 12V DC. D1 is power indicator LED. Large thermal area provided as heatsink to cool down the MOSFET."</em> <a href="https://www.electronics-lab.com/project/60w-led-dimmer-for-12v-leds-using-555-timer/">[...]</a>
