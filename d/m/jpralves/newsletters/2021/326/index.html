<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1796, o inventor norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Hunt_(inventor)">Walter Hunt</a>. Ele concebeu a primeira espingarda de repetição. Hunt começou a inventar no final da adolescência uma máquina para fiar linho, que patenteou em 1826. Inventou também um gongo para bombeiros (1827), uma serra florestal, um fogão que queimava carvão duro. Em 1834, inventou uma máquina de costura com ponto de fechadura, que não patenteou até ser demasiado tarde. Embora as suas invenções valessem a pena, ele não as conseguiu comercializar eficazmente. Em 1849, Hunt fez o primeiro alfinete de segurança a partir de um pedaço de arame de latão com cerca de oito polegadas de comprimento, enrolado no centro e protegido numa extremidade. Patenteou esta invenção como um "alfinete de vestuário", e vendeu os direitos sobre ela por 400 dólares. O seu desenho de espingarda de 1849 tinha um carregador tubular por baixo do cano utilizado com as suas munições de bola "foguete" auto-propulsionadas.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1898, o físico austríaco-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isidor_Isaac_Rabi">Isidor Isaac Rabi</a>. Ele recebeu o Prémio Nobel da Física em 1944 pela sua invenção (em 1937) do método de ressonância magnética atómica e de feixe molecular para medir as propriedades magnéticas dos átomos, moléculas, e núcleos atómicos. Passou a maior parte da sua vida na Universidade de Columbia (1929-67), onde realizou a maior parte da sua investigação pioneira em radar e no momento magnético associado ao spin de electrões nas décadas de 1930 e 1940. O seu trabalho vencedor do Nobel levou à invenção do laser, do relógio atómico, e aos usos diagnósticos da ressonância magnética nuclear. Foi ele que deu origem à ideia do centro de investigação nuclear CERN em Genebra (fundado em 1954).</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1914, o inventor francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Bich">Marcel Bich</a>. Ele construiu o seu império empresarial criando canetas, laminas de barbear e isqueiros Bic descartáveis. Em 1945, Marcel Bich e o seu amigo, Edouard Buffard, adquiriram uma fábrica vazia perto de Paris, França, e logo desenvolveram um próspero negócio, produzindo peças para canetas de tinta permanente e lápis mecânicos de chumbo. Mais tarde, Bich passou dois anos a desenvolver o seu desenho de esferográficas, e em 1949, conseguiu produzir uma esferográfica fiável e de baixo custo. Em 1973, o isqueiro Bic foi introduzido nos EUA, seguido de Bic Shavers, introduzido pela primeira vez em 1976.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1917, o físico inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Boot">Harry Boot</a>. Ele trabalhou com John Randall no desenvolvimento do magnetrão da cavidade, o dispositivo gerador de micro-ondas utilizado no radar. Isto deu uma grande contribuição para vencer a Segunda Guerra Mundial. Os magnetrões anteriores feitos na década de 1920 davam uma baixa potência de saída. Em Fevereiro de 1940, os avanços de Randall e Boot na concepção do magnetrão de cavidade de pequeno tamanho, produziram comprimentos de onda de centímetros a uma potência muito superior, o que permitiu ao radar detectar objectos mais pequenos. Por sua vez, este equipamento mais compacto com uma antena mais pequena permitiu a fácil instalação móvel de radar de alta resolução em aeronaves.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou foi enviado para a estação espacial internacional um novo módulo russo. Devido a um problema técnico na acoplagem o módulo, chamado Nauka, começou a disparar inesperadamente os seus propulsores - o que fez com que toda a estação ficasse fora de posição. O módulo científico há muito esperado já tinha encontrado várias questões técnicas no seu caminho para a ISS, mas uma vez atracado na estação espacial na quinta-feira de manhã, parecia estar ok. Depois cerca de três horas após a sua chegada - por volta das 12:34 ET - Nauka começou subitamente a disparar os seus propulsores. Os astronautas da ISS disseram aos controladores de voo que estavam a ver algo estranho pelas suas janelas. Em resposta à falha, os controladores de voo começaram a disparar propulsores sobre duas outras partes do lado russo do ISS, incluindo o módulo de serviço, naquilo a que chamaram um "tug of war" para colocar a estação de novo na sua posição normal. Às 13h30 ET, os controladores de voo da ISS anunciaram que os propulsores da Nauka tinham finalmente parado de disparar e tinham recuperado o controlo do posicionamento da estação. Durante essa hora, Nauka tinha rodado a estação 45 graus.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker assim como alguns videos interessantes. São apresentadas as revistas Hackspace Magazine nº 45 e a MagPI Nº107 de Agosto.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/about/news-releases/products/replace-silicon-igbts-with-industry-s-most-rugged-silicon-carbid">Replace Silicon IGBTs with Industry’s Most Rugged Silicon Carbide Power Solutions Now Available at 1700V</a></h2>

<p><em>"Today’s energy-efficient electric charging systems powering commercial vehicle propulsion, as well as auxiliary power systems, solar inverters, solid-state transformers and other transportation and industrial applications all rely on high-voltage switching power devices. To meet these requirements, Microchip Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP) today announced the expansion of its silicon carbide portfolio with a family of high-efficiency, high-reliability 1700V silicon carbide MOSFET die, discrete and power modules. Microchip’s 1700V silicon carbide technology is an alternative to silicon IGBTs. The earlier technology required designers to compromise performance and use complicated topologies due to restrictions on switching frequency by lossy silicon IGBTs. In addition, the size and weight of power electronic systems are bloated by transformers, which can only be reduced in size by increasing switching frequency. The new silicon carbide product family allows engineers to move beyond IGBTs, instead using two-level topologies with reduced part count, greater efficiency and simpler control schemes."</em> <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/about/news-releases/products/replace-silicon-igbts-with-industry-s-most-rugged-silicon-carbid">[...]</a>

<p><em>"MAX78000 AI microcontroller and Xailient's Detectum neural network detects and localizes faces in video and images at just 12ms per inference Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (NASDAQ: MXIM) and Xailient Inc., a company focused on artificial intelligence (AI) for the edge, today announced that Maxim Integrated's MAX78000 ultra-low power neural-network microcontroller detects and localizes faces in video and images using Xailient's proprietary Detectum™ neural network. Xailient's neural network draws 250x lower power (at just 280 microJoules) than conventional embedded solutions, and at 12 milliseconds (ms) per inference, the network performs in real time and is faster than the most efficient face-detection solution available for the edge. Battery-powered AI systems that require face detection, such as home cameras, industrial grade smart security cameras and retail solutions, require a low-power solution to provide the longest possible operation between charges. In addition to supporting standalone applications, Maxim Integrated's microcontroller paired with Xailient's neural network improves overall power efficiency and battery life of hybrid edge/cloud applications that employ a low-power 'listening' mode which then awakens more complex systems when a face is detected. Xailient's Detectum neural network includes focus, zoom and visual wake-word technologies to detect and localize faces in video and images at 76x faster rates than conventional software solutions, at similar or better accuracy. In addition, the flexible network can be extended to applications other than facial recognition, such as livestock inventory and monitoring, parking spot occupancy, inventory levels and more."</em> <a href="https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/aboutus/newsroom.html/pr_1742069714">[...]</a>

<p><em>"New Offering Enables Low-Power Voice-Controlled Operation of Embedded Vision AI Systems in IoT and Edge Applications Renesas Electronics Corporation (TSE:6723), a premier supplier of advanced semiconductor solutions, and Syntiant Corp., a deep learning chip technology company advancing low-power intelligent voice and sensor processing in edge devices, today announced the joint development of a voice-controlled multimodal AI solution that enables low-power contactless operation for image processing in vision AI-based IoT and edge systems, such as self-checkout machines, security cameras, and video conference systems, and smart appliances such as robotic cleaning devices. The new solution combines the Renesas RZ/V Series vision AI microprocessor unit (MPU) and the low-power multimodal, multi-feature Syntiant® NDP120 Neural Decision Processor™ to deliver advanced voice and image processing capabilities. The joint solution features always-on functionality with quick voice-triggered activation from standby mode to perform object recognition, facial recognition, and other vision-based tasks that are critical functions in security cameras and other systems. For example, while user-defined voice cues drive activation and system operation, vision AI recognition tracks operator behavior and controls operation or issues a warning when suspicious actions are detected. The multimodal architecture makes it easier to create contactless user experiences for vision AI-based systems. Using a dedicated, power-efficient chip for voice recognition reduces standby power consumption while speeding up system development because it is possible to develop software independently of the vision AI functionality."</em> <a href="https://www.renesas.com/eu/en/about/press-room/renesas-and-syntiant-develop-voice-controlled-multimodal-ai-solution-combining-advanced-vision-and">[...]</a>

<p><em>"From insulator to metal and back again—a new transition phenomenon reported by Rochester and Las Vegas researchers ‘will find a place in physics textbooks.’ Remarkable things happen when a “squishy” compound of manganese and sulfide (MnS2) is compressed in a diamond anvil, say researchers from the University of Rochester and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV). “This is a new type of charge transfer mechanism, and so from a science community point of view this is very, very exciting. We are showing remarkable physical transformations over a very, very short range of parameters, in this case pressure,” says Ashkan Salamat, associate professor of physics at UNLV. For example, as the pressure increases, MnS2, a soft insulator, transitions into a metallic state and then into an insulator again, the researchers describe in a paper flagged as an editor’s choice in Physical Review Letters. “Metals usually remain metals; it is highly unlikely that they can then be changed back to an insulator,” says Ranga Dias, assistant professor of mechanical engineering and of physics and astronomy at Rochester. “The fact that this material goes from an insulator to a metal and back to an insulator is very rare.” Moreover, the transitions are accompanied by unprecedented decreases in resistance and volume across an extremely narrow range of pressure change—all occurring at about 80 degrees Fahrenheit."</em> <a href="https://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/manganese-sulfide-transition-metal-under-pressure-486552/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Astronomers have developed the most realistic model to date of planet formation in binary star systems. The researchers, from the University of Cambridge and the Max Planck Institute for Extra-terrestrial Physics, have shown how exoplanets in binary star systems – such as the ‘Tatooine’ planets spotted by NASA’s Kepler Space Telescope – came into being without being destroyed in their chaotic birth environment. They studied a type of binary system where the smaller companion star orbits the larger parent star approximately once every 100 years – our nearest neighbour, Alpha Centauri, is an example of such a system. “A system like this would be the equivalent of a second Sun where Uranus is, which would have made our own solar system look very different,” said co-author Dr Roman Rafikov from Cambridge’s Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics. Rafikov and his co-author Dr Kedron Silsbee from the Max Planck Institute for Extra-terrestrial Physics found that for planets to form in these systems, the planetesimals – planetary building blocks which orbit around a young star – need to start off at least 10 kilometres in diameter, and the disc of dust and ice and gas surrounding the star within which the planets form needs to be relatively circular. The research, which is published in Astronomy and Astrophysics, brings the study of planet formation in binaries to a new level of realism and explains how such planets, a number of which have been detected, could have formed."</em> <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/astronomers-show-how-planets-form-in-binary-systems-without-getting-crushed">[...]</a>

The removal of space debris is key to sustainability in space, reducing, or even preventing, the risk of obsolete spacecraft colliding with new and existing satellites. What’s more, supporting debris removal missions with Fujitsu’s technology will help to reduce the risk of catastrophic collisions in orbit which could create thousands of other pieces of new debris, all of which pose a very real threat to working satellites in orbit. By carefully deciding which debris is collected and when, the quantum-inspired offering, powered by Digital Annealer, optimises the mission plan to determine the minimum-fuel and minimum-time required to bring inoperable spacecrafts or satellites safely back to the disposal orbit.

<p><em>"To enable the development of wearable devices that possess advanced ultraviolet (UV) detection functions, scientists from NTU Singapore have created a new type of light sensor that is both flexible and highly sensitive.While invisible to the human eye, UV rays surround us in our environment, and excessive exposure can cause health issues including skin cancer and premature skin ageing. The intensity of UV rays is typically reported through an index during weather reports. A wearable device, such as a T-shirt or watch that monitors the actual personal UV exposure throughout the day, would be a useful and more accurate guide for people seeking to avoid sun damage. In their study, which was featured on the front cover of the peer-reviewed journal ACS Nano, the NTU researchers reported that their flexible UV light sensors were 25 times more responsive, and 330 times more sensitive, than existing sensors, exceeding the performance level required for optoelectronic applications – or light-based electronics. The NTU team created their flexible UV light sensors on a semiconductor wafer 8 inches in diameter, using free-standing single-crystalline layers of gallium nitride (GaN) and aluminium gallium nitride (AlGaN), arranged using membranes that consist of two different thin semiconductor layers (heterostructure membranes). This type of semiconductor structure, which can be fabricated using existing industrial compatible methods, allows the material to be easily bent, making it ideal for use in flexible sensors."</em> <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/news/detail/paving-the-way-for-uv-enabled-flexible-wearable-tech">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Study demonstrates a long-predicted process for generating matter directly from light — plus evidence that magnetism can bend polarized photons along different paths in a vacuum Scientists studying particle collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)—a U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science user facility for nuclear physics research at DOE’s Brookhaven National Laboratory—have produced definitive evidence for two physics phenomena predicted more than 80 years ago. The results were derived from a detailed analysis of more than 6,000 pairs of electrons and positrons produced in glancing particle collisions at RHIC and are published in Physical Review Letters. The primary finding is that pairs of electrons and positrons—particles of matter and antimatter—can be created directly by colliding very energetic photons, which are quantum “packets” of light. This conversion of energetic light into matter is a direct consequence of Einstein’s famous E=mc2 equation, which states that energy and matter (or mass) are interchangeable. Nuclear reactions in the sun and at nuclear power plants regularly convert matter into energy. Now scientists have converted light energy directly into matter in a single step."</em> <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=119023">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Army researchers developed a new machine learning-based framework to enhance the security of computer networks inside vehicles without undermining performance. With the widespread prevalence of modern automobiles that entrust control to onboard computers, this research looks toward to a larger Army effort to invest in greater cybersecurity protection measures for its aerial and land platforms, especially heavy vehicles. In collaboration with an international team of experts from Virginia Tech, the University of Queensland and Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, researchers at the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command, known as DEVCOM, Army Research Laboratory devised a technique called DESOLATOR to help optimize a well-known cybersecurity strategy known as the moving target defense. “The idea is that it’s hard to hit a moving target,” said Dr. Terrence Moore, Army mathematician. “If everything is static, the adversary can take their time looking at everything and choosing their targets. But if you shuffle the IP addresses fast enough, then the information assigned to the IP quickly becomes lost, and the adversary has to look for it again.” DESOLATOR, which stands for deep reinforcement learning-based resource allocation and moving target defense deployment framework, helps the in-vehicle network identify the optimal IP shuffling frequency and bandwidth allocation to deliver effective, long-term moving target defense."</em> <a href="https://www.army.mil/article/248815/new_cybersecurity_technique_keeps_hackers_guessing">[...]</a>

The work is a step toward more sustainable electronics. “There is a lot of interest in recycling electronic materials because we want to both reduce electronic waste and maximize the use we get out of rare or costly materials,” says Yuxuan Liu, first author of a paper on the work and a Ph.D. student at NC State. “We’ve demonstrated an approach that allows us to recycle nanowires, and that we think could be extended to other nanomaterials – including nanomaterials containing noble and rare-earth elements.” “Our recycling technique differs from conventional recycling,” says Yong Zhu, corresponding author of the paper and the Andrew A. Adams Distinguished Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at NC State. “When you think about recycling a glass bottle, it is completely melted down before being used to create another glass object. In our approach, a silver nanowire network is separated from the rest of the materials in a device."</em> <a href="https://news.ncsu.edu/2021/07/recycling-nanowires-in-electronics/">[...]</a>
