<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1823, o matemático italiano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Betti">Enrico Betti</a>. Ele destacou-se pelas suas contribuições em álgebra e topologia. O seu trabalho inicial é na área das equações e álgebra. Escreveu a primeira exposição rigorosa da teoria das equações, anteriormente dada sem provas, desenvolvida pelo notável matemático francês Évariste Galois (1811-32). Betti estendeu e deu provas relacionadas com os conceitos algébricos de Galois, publicadas em várias obras de 1851. Betti deu assim um importante contributo para a transição da álgebra clássica para a moderna. Ele foi o primeiro a dar uma prova de que o grupo Galois está fechado sob multiplicação. Betti também escreveu uma memória pioneira sobre topologia, o estudo das superfícies e do espaço. Betti fez um trabalho importante em física teórica, em particular em teoria e elasticidade potenciais.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1833, o químico e inventor sueco <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Nobel">Alfred Nobel</a>. Ele inventou a dinamite e outros explosivos mais poderosos. Perito em explosivos como o seu pai, em 1866 inventou uma forma segura e controlável de nitroglicerina a que chamou dinamite, e mais tarde, pólvora sem fumo e (1875) gelignite. Ajudou a criar um império industrial, fabricando muitas das suas outras invenções. O Nobel acumulou uma enorme fortuna, grande parte da qual deixou num fundo para dotar os prémios anuais que levam o seu nome. Concedidos pela primeira vez em 1901, estes prémios eram para realizações nas áreas da física, química, fisiologia ou medicina, literatura, e paz. O sexto prémio, de economia, foi instituído em sua honra em 1969.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1914, o físico e engenheiro norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_W._Alderson">Samuel W. Alderson</a>. Ele inventou o boneco de teste de colisão utilizado para testar a segurança de automóveis, pára-quedas e outros dispositivos. Desde a década de 1930, quando a segurança dos carros durante um acidente era testada, tinham sido utilizados cadáveres. Quando fundou uma empresa em 1952, Alderson Research Laboratories, que concebeu um manequim antropomórfico, a primeira aplicação foi para testar bancos de ejecção de jactos. Em 1968, produziu um manequim (chamado V.I.P.) construído especificamente para testes automóveis com instrumentos incorporados para a recolha de dados. Tinha juntas articuladas com dimensões e distribuição de peso como um homem adulto médio. Mais tarde, a sua empresa fez também fantasmas médicos para simulações, tais como feridas sintéticas que escorriam sangue falso.</p>

<p>Em 1915 foi feita a primeira comunicação experimental de fala por radiotelefonia transatlântica. Aproveitando os transmissores e receptores de tubos de vácuo recentemente desenvolvidos, a AT&amp;T realizou testes de radiotelefonia da NAA, a estação da Marinha dos EUA em Arlington. B. Webb da AT&amp;T em Arlington, VA.Virginia fala com o tenente-coronel Ferries do governo francês utilizando pontos de retransmissão no Canadá e na Torre Eiffel em Paris. A sua voz foi ouvida tão longe como Honolulu, HI., o que mostrou claramente o quão avançado estava o equipamento de tubos de vácuo, desde o "um pouco mais de 10 milhas" (16-km) de alcance dos inovadores testes do alternador-transmissor de Fessenden (1906). O Presidente Vail anunciou que a AT&amp;T estava a planear acrescentar ligações radiotelefónicas ao sistema Bell.</p>

<p>Em 2011, a Conferência Geral sobre Pesos e Medidas (CGPM) em Sèvres, França, considerou uma resolução para considerar a futura revisão da definição de unidades SI. Esta ainda necessitava de aprovação final, e a sua implementação não seria antes de 2014. No "Novo SI", uma formulação "explícita-constante" aplicar-se-ia a quatro das unidades de base do SI. Assim, o quilograma, o ampere, o kelvin e o mole seriam redefinidos em termos de invariantes da natureza; as novas definições serão baseadas em valores numéricos fixos da constante de Planck (h), da carga elementar (e), da constante de Boltzmann (k), e da constante de Avogadro (NA), respectivamente. Mais notavelmente, pela primeira vez, o quilograma deixaria de ser definido pelo protótipo internacional, um objecto metálico específico e a sua possível variação subtil na massa.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou a nave Shenzhou-13 transportou para a a estação espacial Tiangong três astronautas chineses. Dois homens e uma mulher irão ficar na estação durante cerca de seis meses. Um dos objectivos da missão é testar a capacidade dos astronautas e das instalações durante uma estadia longa. Vão também conduzir diversas experiências cientificas com um braço robótico que será instalado numa das caminhadas no espaço previstas. A estação espacial Tiangong vai pesar cerca de 70 toneladas, após estar concluída, e deverá funcionar durante 15 anos, orbitando a cerca de 400 quilómetros acima da superfície da Terra.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker assim como alguns videos interessantes. É apresentada a revista Hackspace Magazine nº48 de Novembro.</p>

<p><em>"China’s Shenzhou 13 spacecraft left Earth at 12.24am on Saturday, taking its three-person crew – including the country’s second female astronaut – to spend the next six months assembling the Tiangong space station. The craft blasted off from the Jiuquan satellite launch centre in the Gobi Desert in northern China and is expected to arrive at the station’s Tianhe core module – 400km (248 miles) – after a journey of six and a half hours. On board are Wang Yaping, 41, who will be the first woman to set foot on the Tianhe, and her fellow astronauts Zhai Zhigang, 55, and Ye Guangfu, 41. Their six months in orbit will double the record set by their predecessors last summer. Zhai, the most senior of the trio, has been designated mission commander while Ye will be making his maiden space flight. All three previously served as the backup crew for the recently completed Shenzhou 12 mission."</em> <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3152496/countdown-nears-china-space-station-astronauts-six-month-mission">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Next-gen solar material could outshine other solar cells An exciting new solar material called organic-inorganic halide perovskites could one day help the U.S. achieve its solar ambitions and decarbonize the power grid. One thousand times thinner than silicon, perovskite solar materials can be tuned to respond to different colors of the solar spectrum simply by altering their composition mix. Typically fabricated from organic molecules such as methylammonium and inorganic metal halides such as lead iodide, hybrid perovskite solar materials have a high tolerance for defects in their molecular structure and absorb visible light more efficiently than silicon, the solar industry’s standard. Altogether, these qualities make perovskites promising active layers not only in photovoltaics (technologies that convert light into electricity), but also in other types of electronic devices that respond to or control light including light-emitting diodes (LEDs), detectors, and lasers. But “although perovskites offer great potential for greatly expanding solar power, they have yet to be commercialized because their reliable synthesis and long-term stability has long challenged scientists,” said Carolin Sutter-Fella, a scientist at the Molecular Foundry, a nanoscience user facility at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab). “Now, a path to perfect perovskites may soon be within reach.” A recent Nature Communications study co-led by Sutter-Fella reports that solar materials manufacturing could be aided by a sophisticated new instrument that uses two types of light – invisible X-ray light and visible laser light – to probe a perovskite material’s crystal structure and optical properties as it is synthesized."</em> <a href="https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2021/10/19/technique-for-perfect-perovskites/">[...]</a>

With a rapidly ageing population, healthcare providers are seeing more patients suffering from non-healing wounds such as diabetic foot and chronic venous leg ulcers. It has been estimated that about two per cent of the world’s population suffer from chronic wounds. The healing processes for these chronic wounds are often interrupted due to reasons such as infection and repeated trauma, leading to severe stress, pain and discomfort to afflicted patients.

<p><em>"A new machine-learning system costs less, generates less waste, and can be more innovative than manual discovery methods. The growing popularity of 3D printing for manufacturing all sorts of items, from customized medical devices to affordable homes, has created more demand for new 3D printing materials designed for very specific uses. To cut down on the time it takes to discover these new materials, researchers at MIT have developed a data-driven process that uses machine learning to optimize new 3D printing materials with multiple characteristics, like toughness and compression strength. By streamlining materials development, the system lowers costs and lessens the environmental impact by reducing the amount of chemical waste. The machine learning algorithm could also spur innovation by suggesting unique chemical formulations that human intuition might miss. “Materials development is still very much a manual process."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/accelerating-materials-3d-printing-1015">[...]</a>

<p><em>"China's Chang'E-5 lunar sampling mission returned the first lunar samples since the Apollo and Luna missions, the last of which was in 1976. The 3.8 pounds of soil and rocks are the first fresh samples in 45 years, and they are the first samples from a previously unvisited mare basalt. The remnants of this solidified lava flow might be evidence of the Moon's most recent volcanic activity. Researchers aged 47 basalt fragments, ranging in size from a dust particle to the thickness of about 10 pages stacked together, with radiometric dating and found that they were formed roughly 2.03 billion years ago - 800 to 900 million years more recently than the Apollo and Luna samples indicated. The multi-institutional team in China published their results on October 19, 2021, in Nature. "This is the youngest crystallization age ever reported for lunar basaltic rocks by radiometric measurement, extending the range of radio isotopic ages of lunar basalt by 800 to 900 million years," said paper author LI Chunlai, a researcher at the National Astronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (NAOC)."</em> <a href="https://english.cas.cn/newsroom/research_news/phys/202110/t20211019_285831.shtml">[...]</a>

The Standard Model describes all the known particles that make up the universe and the forces that they interact through. It has passed every experimental test to date, and yet physicists know it must be incomplete.

<p><em>"A new optical switch is, at 1 trillion operations per second, between 100 and 1,000 times faster than today's leading commercial electronic transistors, research that may one day help lead to a new generation of computers based on light instead of electricity, say scientists in Russia and at IBM. Computers typically represent data as ones and zeroes by switching transistors between one electric state and the other. Optical computers that replace conventional transistors with optical switches could theoretically operate more quickly than regular computers, as photons travel at the speed of light, while electrons, typically, don’t. The new device relies on a 35-nanometer-wide organic semiconductor polymer film sandwiched between two highly reflective mirrors. The result is a microscopic cavity designed to keep incoming light trapped inside for as long as possible to help it couple with the cavity's material. Two lasers help operate the device—a bright pump laser and a very weak seed laser."</em> <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/optical-switch-1000x-faster-transistors">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This is an ESP32 recreation of the "Dali" digital clock where the digits "melt" into one another. Watch a full demonstration on YouTube The Dali clock was first written in 1979 by Steve Capps for the Xerox Alto and later ported to the Macintosh (see xdaliclock for the full history, including a link to a super trippy film from the 1974s that inspired this whole madness). Later, Jamie Zawinski re-implemented an X Windows version called xdaliclock. I began with the ".xbm" font files from Jamie's work, but my implementation does not share any code with that version. This project is a follow up to my earlier project, the arduino-dali-clock, but instead of driving a TFT panel, it generates composite video output for any NTSC or PAL television or monitor. Putting it together is ridiculously simple, requiring only two wires."</em> <a href="https://github.com/marciot/esp32-dali-clock">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This is a back EMF signal conditioning circuit that can be used to develop high-voltage sensorless motor drivers. When a sensorless algorithm is used to control the BLDC motor speed, the Back EMF (BEMF) signals are used. Based on zero crossing of BEMF signals, motor commutation is decided in the firmware. The signal conditioning circuit has mainly three blocks: the first is a low-pass filter for each phase voltage the second is a comparator circuit for determining the zero crosspoints and the third is a high-speed optocoupler. The optocoupler provides isolation between high-voltage motor driver circuitry and microcontroller. Inputs - 3 Phase Signal inputs, from 3 Phase Motor connections - Current Feedback across the shunt resistor of IPM/IGBT Emitter - DC Bus Monitor, Over Voltage protection, 200V DC or 400V DC Outputs - 3 Phase Digital Zero Cross Signals (Optically Isolated) - DC Bus Over Voltage, Normally High Output (Optically Isolated) - Current to Voltage Cycle by Cycle Output (Optically Isolated) - Optional Trip Optocoupler (Not Install, can be used, If current feedback circuit is not required) Features - Supply 5V DC for Analog Side (Inputs) - Supply 5V DC For Digital Side (Outputs) - Detect the Back EMF of 3 Phase Motor and Provides 3 TTL Outputs - DC Bus Voltage Feedback Low or High TTL Output - Optional Current Sense Circuit provides Cycle by Cycle voltage output proportional to motor current - All outputs are optically Isolated, Frequency up to 20Khz - Jumper J1 – Overvoltage protection, 200V or 400V DC (Close the Jumper for 400V) - The project requires 2 separate 5V DC power supplies, Analog-Input side, and digital-Output side - PCB dimensions: 47.94 x 42.70 mm BLDC Motor Winding and Back EMF To run a BLDC motor without sensors, it is important to sense the rotor magnet position with reference to the windings on the stator."</em> <a href="https://www.electronics-lab.com/project/signal-conditioner-for-sensorless-bldc-operations/">[...]</a>

The Head part is detachable or swappable, which means we can prepare two or more Naruto Heads and add different color LEDs on the backside, then we can swap them for whatever light color we need. I've modeled Naruto's face in my PCBCad software and then send it to PCBway for samples.
