<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1787, o artista e inventor francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Daguerre">Louis Daguerre</a>. Ele inventou o daguerreótipo, o primeiro processo prático da fotografia. Embora a primeira fotografia permanente da natureza tenha sido feita em 1826/27 por Joseph-Nicéphore Niepce de França, era de má qualidade e exigia cerca de oito horas de tempo de exposição. O processo que a Daguerre desenvolveu exigiu apenas 20 a 30 minutos. Os dois tornaram-se parceiros no desenvolvimento do processo heliográfico da Niepce desde 1829 até à morte da Niepce em 1833. Daguerre continuou as suas experiências, e descobriu que a exposição de uma placa de prata iodada numa câmara resultaria numa imagem duradoura após um processo de fixação química.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1839, o físico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Kundt">August Kundt</a>. Ele desenvolveu um método para determinar a velocidade do som em gases e sólidos. Ele utilizou um tubo de vidro fechado no qual foi aspergido um pó seco (como o licopódio). A fonte do som no dispositivo original era uma haste metálica presa no seu centro com um pistão numa extremidade, que é inserida no tubo. Quando a haste é acariciada, ondas sonoras geradas pelo pistão entram no tubo. Se a posição do pistão no tubo for ajustada de modo a que a coluna de gás tenha um número inteiro de meio comprimento de onda, o pó será perturbado pelas ondas estacionárias resultantes, formando uma série de estrias, permitindo a medição das distâncias entre nós.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1897, o físico inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Blackett">Patrick Blackett</a>. Ele recebeu o Prémio Nobel da Física em 1948 pelas suas descobertas no campo da radiação cósmica. Nestes estudos, utilizou fotografias de câmaras de nuvens que revelavam a forma como um núcleo atómico estável pode ser desintegrado bombardeando-o com partículas alfa (núcleos de hélio). Embora tal desintegração nuclear tivesse sido observada anteriormente, os seus dados explicaram este fenómeno pela primeira vez e foram úteis para explicar a desintegração por outros meios.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1906, o engenheiro turco-britânico <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Issigonis">Alec Issigonis</a>. Ele foi o designer do automóvel Mini, um marco no design automóvel quando a British Motor Corporation introduziu o Morris Mini-Minor a 26 de Agosto de 1959. Tinha apenas 10 pés de comprimento, mas permitia sentar quatro passageiros, e era um dos carros com os preços mais baixos do mercado. Para poupar espaço, o motor era montado transversalmente, e tinha uma suspensão totalmente independente. Issigonis acreditava que "quando se está a conceber um carro novo para produção, nunca, nunca copie a oposição". Assim, o Mini assemelhava-se a nenhum outro carro, fornecia um veículo que transportava a maior carga útil no menor espaço prático, e incorporava novos princípios de engenharia. Continua a ter sucesso mais de cinco décadas depois porque o construiu desde o início para economia de combustível, aceleração rápida, maneabilidade e facilidade de estacionamento.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1923, o astronauta norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Shepard">Alan Shepard</a>. Ele foi o primeiro homem da América no espaço e um dos únicos 12 humanos que caminharam na Lua. Nomeado como um dos sete astronautas originais da nação Mercury em 1959, Shepard tornou-se o primeiro americano a entrar no espaço em 5 de Maio de 1961, a bordo de um foguete Redstone num voo suborbital de 15 minutos que o levou a ele e à sua cápsula Mercury 7 Freedom 115 milhas de altitude e 302 milhas para baixo do Cabo Canaveral, FL. (O seu voo chegou três semanas após o lançamento do cosmonauta soviético Yuri Gagarin, que em 12 de Abril de 1961, se tornou o primeiro viajante espacial humano num voo de um órbita com a duração de 108 minutos).</p>

<p>Hoje acontece o o mais longo eclipse lunar desde 1441. O evento irá durar cerca de 3 horas e meia e o fenómeno ocorre quando a Terra passa entre o Sol e a Lua, criando uma sombra sobre o nosso satélite natural. Apesar disso, a Lua não desaparece, mas fica sim num tom avermelhado que lhe dá o nome de "lua de sangue". O eclipse quase total será visível no lado nocturno da Terra. Poderá ser visto no céu da América do Norte, Austrália, Nova Zelândia, Japão, China, Sudeste Asiático, Havai e partes da Rússia. Alguns na quinta-feira ao final do dia e outros durante a madrugada de sexta-feira. Infelizmente, em Portugal, este fenómeno apenas poderá ser observado nos Açores.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker assim como alguns videos interessantes.</p>

<p><em>"On November 19, 2021 (late evening of the 18th in some time zones), the Moon passes into the shadow of the Earth, creating a partial lunar eclipse so deep that it can reasonably be called almost total. What is an “almost total” lunar eclipse? A lunar eclipse occurs when the Sun, Earth, and Moon align so that the Moon passes into Earth’s shadow. In a total lunar eclipse, the entire Moon falls within the darkest part of Earth’s shadow, called the umbra. In this eclipse, up to 99.1% of the Moon’s disk will be within Earth’s umbra. How can I observe the eclipse?"</em> <a href="https://moon.nasa.gov/news/168/an-almost-total-lunar-eclipse/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Nexperia, the expert in essential semiconductors, today announced the industry’s first range of A-selection Zener diodes. With a tolerance of just ±1%, the BZT52H-A (SOD123F) and BZX384-A (SOD323) series provide a higher precision voltage reference compared to the B (±2%) and C (±5%) variants. Matching the rising demands of mobile, portable/wearable, automotive and industrial applications and meeting the increasing regulatory requirements, the two series are also available as Q-portfolio devices. “Nexperia’s A-selection Zener diode range covers every application from 1.8 V to 75 V while providing a precise voltage reference with the lowest possible tolerance,” says Paula Stümer, product manager at Nexperia. “By replacing B- or C-selection devices with pad compatible A-selection Zener devices, engineers can go to the limits of the MOSFET, if applied to limit voltage for the gate-source path or drain-gate path, or choose from a wider variety of suitable MOSFETs.” The A-selection Zener diodes have a nominal working voltage range of 1.8 V to 75 V (E24 range). The devices feature a non-repetitive peak reverse power dissipation of ≤40W, total power dissipation ≤250mW and low differential thermal resistance."</em> <a href="https://www.nexperia.com/about/news-events/press-releases/Nexperia-introduces-a-range-of-A-selection-Zener-diodes-for-precise-voltage-reference-with-the-industrys-lowest-tolerance-of-1.html">[...]</a>

By specifying maximum values for switching characteristics (turn-on time, turn-off time), the new photocoupler can be used as a unidirectional switch. It can also be used in feedback circuits of analog signals in 100V to 200V equipment, helping to reduce the cost of application circuits. Applications - Automotive equipment - Battery Management Systems: voltage monitoring, mechanical relay sticking detection, ground fault detection, etc."</em> <a href="https://toshiba.semicon-storage.com/ap-en/company/news/news-topics/2021/11/automotive-20211118-1.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"STMicroelectronics (NYSE: STM), a global semiconductor leader serving customers across the spectrum of electronics applications, has introduced a world-first automotive satellite-navigation chip that delivers high-quality position data needed by advanced driving systems. Joining ST’s Teseo V family, the STA8135GA is the first automotive-qualified GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) receiver to integrate a triple-band positioning measurement engine on-chip, in addition to standard multi-band Position-Velocity-Time (PVT) and dead-reckoning. Triple band has historically been used in professional applications such as surveying, mapping, and precision agriculture that demand millimeter accuracy with minimal reliance on correction data. Until now only available in chipsets or modules, which are typically larger and more expensive than ST’s single-chip solution, triple-band enables the receiver to efficiently acquire and track the largest number of satellites in multiple constellations simultaneously for superior performance in difficult conditions such as in urban canyons and under tree cover. Bringing this capability to the automotive market in a compact and convenient package, the STA8135GA helps driver-assistance systems make accurate decisions about the road ahead. The multi-constellation receiver delivers raw information for the host system to run any precise-positioning algorithm, such as PPP/RTK (Precise Point Positioning / Real-Time Kinematic)."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/p4407.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A copper surface coated with layered thin films helps to create useful chemicals from a polluting greenhouse gas Carbon dioxide (CO2), a product of burning fossil fuels and the most prevalent greenhouse gas, has the potential to be sustainably converted back into useful fuels. A promising route for turning CO2 emissions into a fuel feedstock is a process known as electrochemical reduction. But to be commercially viable, the process needs to be improved, to select for, or to yield, a higher amount of desirable carbon-rich products. Now, as reported in the journal Nature Energy, researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) have improved the process’s selectivity by developing a new approach to modify the surface of the copper catalysts used to assist the reaction. “Although we know copper is the best catalyst for this reaction, it doesn’t give high selectivity to the desired products,” said Alexis Bell, a faculty senior scientist in Berkeley Lab’s Chemical Sciences Division and professor of chemical engineering at UC Berkeley. “Our group has found that you can do various tricks with the local environment of the catalyst to provide that selectivity.” In previous studies, the researchers had established the precise conditions that gave the best electrical and chemical environment for creating commercially interesting carbon-rich products."</em> <a href="https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2021/11/17/carbon-dioxide-into-liquid-fuels/">[...]</a>

Such analysis allows scientists to assess periodic reactivity and bonding trends in an otherwise mysterious element. “Californium captures the imagination and offers broad science appeal because of its exotic place in the periodic table,” said Andrew Gaunt, a Los Alamos chemist and one of the paper’s lead authors. “Due to the scarcity of well-characterized molecules, we are testing and expanding the known limits of chemical bonding and electronic structure for an element that has largely eluded definition.” He added, “Organometallic molecules have proven foundational in understanding the chemical properties of many metals. Conducting organometallic studies to californium allows an unprecedented comparison to earlier, more accessible actinide chemistry such as with thorium and uranium, and heavy lanthanide analogues. Via these side-to-side comparisons we can begin to assess periodic reactivity and bonding trends that have sat frustratingly out of reach for decades.” Californium is the heaviest element that, although very scarce, is available on a milligram scale, just large enough to conduct classical synthetic chemistry – that is, to isolate molecules in pure single-crystal form, determine their structures (how atoms in a molecule are arranged in space and connected to each other), and acquire spectroscopic data that, coupled to quantum mechanical calculations, informs about the distribution and properties of electrons in the molecules."</em> <a href="https://discover.lanl.gov/news/releases/1117-californium">[...]</a>

The more inclusive a gauge theory is of fields, forces, particles, spatial dimensions and other parameters, the more complex it is—and the more difficult it is for a classical supercomputer to model."</em> <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/science/news/canadian-researchers-achieve-first-quantum-simulation">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers at the Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory designed a novel polymer to bind and strengthen silica sand for binder jet additive manufacturing, a 3D-printing method used by industries for prototyping and part production. The printable polymer enables sand structures with intricate geometries and exceptional strength – and is also water soluble. The study, published in Nature Communications, demonstrates a 3D-printed sand bridge that at 6.5 centimeters can hold 300 times its own weight, a feat analogous to 12 Empire State Buildings sitting on the Brooklyn Bridge. The binder jet printing process is cheaper and faster than other 3D-printing methods used by industry and makes it possible to create 3D structures from a variety of powdered materials, offering advantages in cost and scalability. The concept stems from inkjet printing, but instead of using ink, the printer head jets out a liquid polymer to bind a powdered material, such as sand, building up a 3D design layer by layer. The binding polymer is what gives the printed sand its strength."</em> <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/news/polymer-discovery-gives-3d-printed-sand-super-strength">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Exotic laser-produced high-energy-density (HED) plasmas akin to those found in stars and nuclear explosions could provide insight into events throughout the universe. Physicists at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) have discovered a new way to measure and understand these plasmas, among the most extreme states of matter ever produced on Earth. Improved understanding could provide benefits ranging from fine-tuning the high-density plasmas in inertial confinement fusion experiments to better understanding of processes throughout the universe. A billion times denser HED plasmas are a billion times denser than those that fuel fusion reactions in tokamaks, doughnut-shaped magnetic fusion facilities such as the National Spherical Torus Experiment-Upgrade (NSTX-U) at PPPL. “Everything functions very differently in HED plasmas,” said PPPL physicist Brian Kraus, lead author of a paper in Physical Review Letters that describe the measurement techniques. “We need to better understand how physics works at these very high densities, but clarifying measurements have been difficult up until now.” Plasma comprises 99 percent of the visible universe and consists of free-floating electrons and atomic nuclei, or ions."</em> <a href="https://www.pppl.gov/news/2021/pppl-scientists-create-insights-perhaps-most-extreme-state-matter-produced-earth">[...]</a>

The research may be important for the creation of quantum technologies which require the directional transfer of energy and information at small scales. Reciprocity, going the same way backward as forward, is a ubiquitous concept in physics. A famous example may be found in Newton’s Law: for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. The breakdown of such a powerful notion as reciprocity in any area of physics, from mechanics to optics to electromagnetism, is typically associated with surprises which can be exploited for technological application. For example, a nonreciprocal electric diode allows current to pass in forwards but not backwards and forms a building block of the microelectronics industry."</em> <a href="http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/newsandevents/news/articles/physicistsrevealnon-recipr.php">[...]</a>

The project, published in the international journal Communications Materials, shows how the artificial micro-hooks can be applied to a series of devices that, when attached to plant leaves, act as a kind of temporary plaster, releasing beneficial substances into the plant’s vascular system, or as intelligent clips that wirelessly communicate information on the health status of crop plants. The research has been funded with the support of the National Geographic Society, and as part of the European GrowBot project dedicated to the creation of new robots inspired by climbing plants and for which Mazzolai is coordinator.

Isotopes are forms of a chemical element that have the same number of protons in their atomic nuclei but a different number of neutrons. Atomic nuclei are usually spherical or nearly spherical. For a given element, though, when the number of neutrons changes, a gradual change in nuclear shape, or even a sudden one, can occur. However, 50 years ago, an experiment at ISOLDE revealed that the nuclei of mercury isotopes actually alternate dramatically in shape, from a sphere to a pronounced rugby ball, as single neutrons are removed from, or added to, the nucleus."</em> <a href="https://home.cern/news/news/physics/bismuth-isotopes-also-alternate-spheres-rugby-balls">[...]</a>

However, this controller is different. It’ll be the most comfortable RC Controller you’ve ever held. Because it will be perfectly suited to your unique hand Introduction This is the second part of this project."</em> <a href="https://smartsolutions4home.com/ss4h-rc-transmitter/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Plastic pollution is a well-known problem worldwide, and is still growing. It negatively affects humans and wildlife through animal death, groundwater pollution and incorporation of micro plastics in our digestive system. There are many initiatives focusing on reducing the negative effects of plastic pollution, but the amount of plastic consumed and the subsequent pollution is still increasing every year. Additionally, in the current COVID-19 pandemic the dependency on single-use plastics has increased exponentially. That is why it is important to keep improving recycling infrastructure, especially in low and middle-income countries. Their plastic waste management is often informal, and tools are insufficient for the correct management of plastic waste, resulting in plastic pollution.The research conducted in this thesis showed that especially t he sorting stage of the plastic recycling process is very time consuming and labor-intensive."</em> <a href="https://plasticscanner.com/">[...]</a>
