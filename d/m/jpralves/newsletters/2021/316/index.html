<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1851, o inventor germano-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emile_Berliner">Emile Berliner</a>. Ele fez contribuições importantes para a tecnologia do telefone e desenvolveu o disco de registo fonográfico, o microfone em 1877 e o gramofone em 1887. Enquanto Thomas Edison inventou os discos cilíndricos, Berliner teve a ideia de usar discos. Ele cunhou a palavra gramofone como marca registada. Mais tarde, ele tornou-se um pioneiro no desenho de helicópteros.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1860, o bioquímico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduard_Buchner">Eduard Buchner</a>. Ele recebeu o Prémio Nobel de Química em 1907 por demonstrar que a fermentação de carboidratos resulta da acção de diferentes enzimas contidas na levedura e não na própria célula de levedura. Ele mostrou que uma enzima, a zimase, pode ser extraída das células de levedura e que causa a quebra do açúcar.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1895, o desenhador de aeronaves britânico <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._J._Mitchell">R. J. Mitchell</a>. Ele desenvolveu o Spitfire de oito armas (1936), um dos caças mais conhecidos na Segunda Guerra Mundial. Ele foi engenheiro e projectista da Supermarine Aviation Works (1916-37), engenheiro-chefe (de 1919) e também era conhecido pelo projecto de uma série de lanchas e hidroaviões de alta velocidade. Nos anos de 1920 a 1936, ele projectou nada menos que 24 aeronaves diferentes. O Spitfire era um derivado de sua anterior aeronave de corrida de hidroaviões, a S.6B.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1901, o engenheiro japonês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideo_Shima">Hideo Shima</a>. Ele projectou e supervisionou a construção do primeiro comboio "bala" de alta velocidade do mundo, ligando Tóquio a Osaka. Tendo começado a operar a 222 km/h em Outubro de 1964. A linha ferroviária abriu uma nova era no transporte terrestre. (A geração actual chega a 271 km/h). Shima liderou o programa de desenvolvimento espacial do Japão até 1977 na Agência Nacional de Desenvolvimento Espacial do Japão. Ele desenvolveu a força motriz eléctrica distribuída ao longo de todo o comprimento do comboio, tendo capacidade de gerar maior potência num comboio de várias unidades, sem danificar os trilhos e as estruturas.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1913, o engenheiro electrotécnico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Hewlett">Bill Hewlett</a>. Ele co-fundou a Hewlett-Packard Company, um fabricante líder de computadores, impressoras de computador e equipamentos analíticos e de medição. Em 1939, ele formou uma parceria conhecida como Hewlett-Packard Company com David Packard, um amigo e colega de classe de Stanford. O primeiro produto da HP foi um oscilador de áudio baseado num desenho desenvolvido por Hewlett quando ele estava na faculdade. Oito foram vendidos para Walt Disney para o filme Fantasia. A empresa começou com um capital inicial de $538 e sua primeira unidade de produção foi uma pequena garagem em Palo Alto.</p>

<p>Em 1498, Vasco da Gama chegava à Índia, tornando-se o primeiro europeu a chegar à Índia via Oceano Indico. Depois de partir de Lisboa a 8 de Julho de 1497, e de ter dobrado o cabo da boa esperança, Vasco da Gama com as suas quatro embarcações, acompanhado por Bartolomeu Dias chegaram dez meses depois a Kappakadavu, terra próxima de  Calecute, ficando estabelecida a Rota do Cabo e aberto o caminho marítimo dos Europeus para a Índia.</p>

<p>Em 1927 o aviador americano Charles A. Lindbergh descola do Roosevelt Field em Long Island, Nova York, no primeiro voo solo sem escalas do mundo através do Oceano Atlântico. Este primeiro voo sem escalas entre Nova York e Paris demorou 33 horas e meia tendo percorrido cerca de 5800 km.</p>

<p>Em 1978 a NASA lançou para o espaço a sonda Pionner para fazer explorações em Vénus. Era um cilindro movido a energia solar do tamanho de uma banheira de hidromassagem.</p>

<p>Faz hoje 31 anos que o telescópio espacial Hubble enviava a sua primeira fotografia do espaço, uma imagem de uma estrela dupla a 1.260 anos-luz de distância.</p>

<p>E nesta semana que passou o rover chinês aterrou na superfície de Marte numa zona perto da Utopia Planitia. Foram partilhadas as primeiras imagens captadas pelo rover. O Zhurong chegou ao planeta vermelho no passado fim-de-semana.</p>

<p><em>"Two photos and two videos captured by China's Mars probe Tianwen-1 during and after the country's first landing on the red planet were released by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) on Wednesday. The lander carrying a rover of the Tianwen-1 mission touched down in the southern part of Utopia Planitia, a vast plain on the northern hemisphere of Mars, on May 15, becoming the country's first probe to land on a planet other than Earth. The first photograph, a black and white image, was taken by an obstacle avoidance camera installed in front of the Mars rover. The image shows that a ramp on the lander has been extended to the surface of Mars. The terrain of the rover's forward direction is clearly visible in the image, and the horizon of Mars appears curved due to the wide-angle lens. The second image, a color photo, was taken by the navigation camera fitted to the rear of the rover."</em> <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-05/19/c_139956427.htm">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4206524">Taiwan’s TSMC claims breakthrough on 1nm chips</a></h2>

<p><em>"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), National Taiwan University (NTU), and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have made a significant breakthrough in the development of 1-nanometer chips, reports said Tuesday (May 18). The joint announcement has trumped IBM’s statement earlier in the month about the development of a 2nm semiconductor, British website Verdict reported. While at present the most advanced chips are 5nm, TSMC’s find was likely to lead to power-saving and higher speeds for future electric vehicles, artificial intelligence, and other new technologies. The discovery was first made by the MIT team, with elements optimized by TSMC and improved by NTU’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Optometrics, according to a report in Nature Magazine. The key element of the research outcome was that using the semi-metal bismuth as the contract electrode of a two-dimensional material to replace silicon can cut resistance and increase the current, Verdict reported. Energy efficiency would thus increase to the highest possible level for semiconductors."</em> <a href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4206524">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Rocket Lab Progresses Flight Review, Recovers First Stage Following Successful Ocean Splashdown On May 15, 2021, Rocket Lab experienced an anomaly almost three minutes into the company’s 20th Electron launch. Following a successful lift-off from Launch Complex 1, Electron proceeded through a nominal first stage engine burn, stage separation, and stage 2 ignition. Shortly after the second stage ignition the engine shut down, resulting in the loss of the mission. Rocket Lab continued to receive good telemetry from Electron following the safe engine shutdown on stage two, providing engineers with comprehensive data to review as part of a robust review into the anomaly. The extensive data is being methodically scoured to enable the review team to accurately pinpoint the issue and implement corrective actions for future missions. Rocket Lab is leading the flight review with the support of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA); a structure that ensures Rocket Lab maintains a high degree of control over its return-to-flight schedule."</em> <a href="https://www.rocketlabusa.com/about-us/updates/rocket-lab-progresses-flight-review-recovers-first-stage-following-successful-ocean-splashdown/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"MAHLE is currently developing a new kind of magnet-free electric motor that does not require rare earth elements. This not only makes production more environmentally compatible, but also brings advantages in terms of costs and resource security. The central feature of the new motor is the inductive and thus contactless power transmission—this allows the motor to operate wear-free and particularly efficiently at high speeds. The efficiency is above 95% at almost all operating points—a level that previously has only been achieved by Formula E racing cars. MAHLE has thus succeeded in combining the strengths of various electric motor concepts in one product. This new development is easily scalable, so it can be used in anything from subcompacts through commercial vehicles."</em> <a href="https://www.mahle.com/en/news-and-press/press-releases/mahle-develops-highly-efficient-magnet-free-electric-motor--82368">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched a new fleet of Starlink internet satellites into orbit alongside two rideshare satellites Saturday evening (May 15), before sticking a stunning landing at sea. The veteran Falcon 9 rocket blasted off from Pad 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center here in Florida at 6:56 p.m. EDT (2056 GMT), marking the company's 15th launch of the year. It also marked the eighth flight for this particular Falcon 9. The successful liftoff marked the third time SpaceX launched one of its 229-foot-tall (70 meters) workhorse Falcon 9 rockets within as many weeks, as the company works to expand its burgeoning broadband constellation. Approximately nine minutes after liftoff, the rocket's first stage returned to Earth, touching down on SpaceX's drone ship "Of Course I Still Love You," for a 8th successful landing. A camera aboard the rocket stage captured spectacular video of the entire descent back to Earth."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-starlink-27-launch-rocket-landing-success">[...]</a>

A NASA team has found that organic salts are likely present on Mars. Like shards of ancient pottery, these salts are the chemical remnants of organic compounds, such as those previously detected by NASA’s Curiosity rover. Organic compounds and salts on Mars could have formed by geologic processes or be remnants of ancient microbial life. Besides adding more evidence to the idea that there once was organic matter on Mars, directly detecting organic salts would also support modern-day Martian habitability, given that on Earth, some organisms can use organic salts, such as oxalates and acetates, for energy. “If we determine that there are organic salts concentrated anywhere on Mars, we’ll want to investigate those regions further, and ideally drill deeper below the surface where organic matter could be better preserved,” said James M. T. Lewis, an organic geochemist who led the research, published on March 30 in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/salts-could-be-important-piece-of-martian-organic-puzzle-nasa-scientists-find">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Samsung’s two new enterprise PMICs, S2FPD01 and S2FPD02, can reduce overheating with more than 90% energy-efficiency within the memory module The S2FPC01 offers power-saving benefits to PC DRAM modules in a compact form factor Samsung Electronics, a world leader in advanced semiconductor technology, today announced the industry’s first integrated power management ICs (PMICs) — S2FPD01, S2FPD02 and S2FPC01, for the fifth-generation double data rate (DDR5) dual in-line memory module (DIMM). One major design improvement to the newest generation DRAM solution involves integrating the PMIC into the memory module — previous generations placed the PMIC on the motherboard — offering increased compatibility and signal integrity, and providing a more reliable and sustained performance. For improved performance efficiency and load-transient responses, Samsung’s new PMICs for DDR5 modules have been equipped with a high-efficiency hybrid gate driver and a proprietary control design (asynchronous-based dual-phase buck control scheme). This scheme allows the DC voltage to step down from high to low with a fast transient response to changes in the output load current and adapts the conversion accordingly to efficiently regulate its output voltage at near-constant levels. The control scheme also features both pulse width and pulse frequency modulation methods, preventing delays and malfunctions when switching modes. “With enhanced power efficiency and low output ripple voltage, the new PMICs S2FPD01, S2FPD02 and S2FPC01 allow data centers, enterprise servers and PC applications to take full advantage of their DDR5 performance for highly demanding, memory-intensive tasks,” said Harry Cho, vice president of System LSI marketing at Samsung Electronics."</em> <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-unveils-new-power-management-solutions-for-ddr5-modules">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The School of Physical Sciences, in collaboration with the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) and the Universities of Cardiff, Durham and Leeds, have developed an algorithm to train computers to analyse signals from subatomic particles embedded in advanced electronic materials. The particles, called muons, are produced in large particle accelerators and are implanted inside samples of materials in order to investigate their magnetic properties. Muons are uniquely useful as they couple magnetically to individual atoms inside the material and then emit a signal detectable by researchers to obtain information on that magnetism. This ability to examine magnetism on the atomic scale makes muon-based measurements one of the most powerful probes of magnetism in electronic materials, including “quantum materials” such as superconductors and other exotic forms of matter. As it is not possible to deduce what is going on in the material by simple examination of the signal, researchers normally compare their data to generic models. In contrast, the present team adapted a data-science technique called Principal Component Analysis (PCA), frequently employed in Face Recognition."</em> <a href="https://www.kent.ac.uk/news/science/28752/researchers-develop-algorithm-to-see-inside-materials-with-subatomic-particles">[...]</a>

This results in the widespread use of the 2.4GHz radio frequency that WiFi uses, with excess signals available to be tapped for alternative uses. To harness this under-utilised source of energy, a research team from the National University of Singapore (NUS) and Japan’s Tohoku University (TU) has developed a technology that uses tiny smart devices known as spin-torque oscillators (STOs) to harvest and convert wireless radio frequencies into energy to power small electronics. In their study, the researchers had successfully harvested energy using WiFi-band signals to power a light-emitting diode (LED) wirelessly, and without using any battery. “We are surrounded by WiFi signals, but when we are not using them to access the Internet, they are inactive, and this is a huge waste.

While it is very easy to study the macroscopic products of a reaction, it has so far been difficult to gain a more accurate picture of the course of chemical reactions at the atomic level.

<p><em>"Scientists have used fibre-optic sensing to obtain the most detailed measurements of ice properties ever taken on the Greenland Ice Sheet. Their findings will be used to make more accurate models of the future movement of the world’s second-largest ice sheet, as the effects of climate change continue to accelerate. The research team, led by the University of Cambridge, used a new technique in which laser pulses are transmitted in a fibre-optic cable to obtain highly detailed temperature measurements from the surface of the ice sheet all the way to the base, more than 1,000 metres below. In contrast to previous studies, which measured temperature from separate sensors located tens or even hundreds of metres apart, the new approach allows temperature to be measured along the entire length of a fibre-optic cable installed in a deep borehole. The result is a highly detailed profile of temperature, which controls how fast ice deforms and ultimately how fast the ice sheet flows. The temperature of ice sheets was thought to vary as a smooth gradient, with the warmest sections on the surface where the sun hits, and at the base where it’s warmed by geothermal energy and friction as the ice sheet grinds across the subglacial landscape toward the ocean."</em> <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/storeglacier">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The UCF-developed propulsion system could allow for flight speeds of Mach 6 to 17 (more than 4,600 to 13,000 miles per hour) and would have applications in air and space travel. University of Central Florida researchers are building on their technology that could pave the way for hypersonic flight, such as travel from New York to Los Angeles in under 30 minutes. In their latest research published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers discovered a way to stabilize the detonation needed for hypersonic propulsion by creating a special hypersonic reaction chamber for jet engines. “There is an intensifying international effort to develop robust propulsion systems for hypersonic and supersonic flight that would allow flight through our atmosphere at very high speeds and also allow efficient entry and exit from planetary atmospheres,” says study co-author Kareem Ahmed, an associate professor in UCF’s Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. “The discovery of stabilizing a detonation — the most powerful form of intense reaction and energy release — has the potential to revolutionize hypersonic propulsion and energy systems.” The system could allow for air travel at speeds of Mach 6 to 17, which is more than 4,600 to 13,000 miles per hour. The technology harnesses the power of an oblique detonation wave, which they formed by using an angled ramp inside the reaction chamber to create a detonation-inducing shock wave for propulsion."</em> <a href="https://www.ucf.edu/news/flying-at-speeds-up-to-mach-16-could-become-reality-with-ucfs-developing-propulsion-system/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"High-temperature and high-pressure experiments involving a diamond anvil and chemicals to simulate the core of the young Earth demonstrate for the first time that hydrogen can bond strongly with iron in extreme conditions. This explains the presence of significant amounts of hydrogen in the Earth’s core that arrived as water from bombardments billions of years ago. Given the extreme depths, temperatures and pressures involved, we are not physically able to probe very far into the earth directly. So, in order to peer deep inside the Earth, researchers use techniques involving seismic data to ascertain things like composition and density of subterranean material. Something that has stood out for as long as these kinds of measurements have been taking place is that the core is primarily made of iron, but its density, in particular that of the liquid part, is lower than expected. This led researchers to believe there must be an abundance of light elements alongside the iron."</em> <a href="https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/focus/en/press/z0508_00178.html">[...]</a>

An international research group has now made significant progress in the further development of this approach: With two complementary experiments at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR) and at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität Munich (LMU), the team was able to combine two different plasma technologies for the first time and build a novel hybrid accelerator.

In conventional particle accelerators, strong radio waves are guided into specially shaped metal tubes called resonators. The particles to be accelerated – which are often electrons – can ride these radio waves like surfers ride an ocean wave. But the potential of the technology is limited: Feeding too much radio wave power into the resonators creates a risk of electrical charges that can damage the component."</em> <a href="https://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pNid=99&amp;pOid=63449">[...]</a>

A research team has found that a method commonly used to skirt one of metal 3D printing’s biggest problems may be far from a silver bullet. For manufacturers, 3D printing, or additive manufacturing, provides a means of building complex-shaped parts that are more durable, lighter and more environmentally friendly than those made through traditional methods. The industry is burgeoning, with some predicting it to double in size every three years, but growth often goes hand in hand with growing pains. Residual stress, a byproduct of the repeated heating and cooling inherent to metal printing processes, can introduce defects into parts and, in some cases, damage printers. To better understand how residual stress forms, and how it might be curbed, researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory and other institutions closely examined the effects of different printing patterns in titanium alloy parts made with a common laser-based method."</em> <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2021/05/new-research-could-help-manufacturers-avoid-3d-printing-pitfall">[...]</a>

Here we will build a band that can be worn by women, using which they can inform police or anyone, using SOS emergency SMS along with the current location. Using this information, the police will be able to save the victim from the location. For this, here we are using an ESP8266 which can be interfaced with GSM and GPS module for sending SMS alerts and getting the location coordinates.

<p><em>"Take care of your plant automatically Having plants require to take care of them and give them water everyday. But when you have to work around the clock, you don't have the time or just can forget to water your precious plant. To evoid letting the plants die, I have created a sytsem watering them automatically. For this project we need to water plants so we will use a 12V pump controlled by a relay, a water sensor to know the level of the water which is coupled to a strip led, a soil moisture sensor to measure the volume of water in the earth and a photoresistor that will stop the system during the night.
