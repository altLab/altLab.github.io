<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1800, o inventor, matemático, químico, físico, filólogo e egiptólogo inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Fox_Talbot">Henry Fox Talbot</a>. Ele inventou o processo fotográfico negativo-positivo. Ele melhorou a descoberta de Thomas Wedgwood (1802) de que escovar uma solução de nitrato de prata no papel produz um meio sensível à luz capaz de registar imagens negativas, mas Wedgewood não foi capaz de controlar o escurecimento. Em Fevereiro de 1835, Talbot descobriu que uma solução forte de sal fixa a imagem. Usando uma câmara obscura para focar uma imagem no seu papel para produzir um negativo, e ao expor uma segunda folha de papel à luz do sol transmitida pelo negativo - ele foi o primeiro a produzir uma imagem positiva da qual foi capaz de fazer mais cópias à vontade. Seu Pencil of Nature (1844) foi o primeiro livro ilustrado fotograficamente.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1839, o físico matemático e químico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Willard_Gibbs">Josiah Willard Gibbs</a>. Ele ficou conhecido pelas suas contribuições à análise vectorial e como um dos fundadores da físico-química. Em 1863, ele recebeu o primeiro doutoramento em engenharia da Universidade de Yale. O seu principal trabalho foi no desenvolvimento da teoria termodinâmica, que trouxe a físico-química de uma investigação empírica para uma ciência dedutiva. Em 1873, ele publicou dois artigos sobre a natureza fundamental da entropia de um sistema, e estabeleceu a “superfície termodinâmica”, um método geométrico e gráfico para a análise das propriedades termodinâmicas das substâncias. O seu famoso "On the Equilibrium of Homogeneous Substances", publicado em 1876, estabeleceu o uso de “potencial químico”, agora um conceito importante em físico-química.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1847, o inventor norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison">Thomas Edison</a>. Ele detinha um recorde mundial de 1.093 patentes (incluindo as detidas em conjunto) e criou o primeiro laboratório de pesquisa industrial do mundo. Ele mostrou desde cedo uma curiosidade por explicações de como tudo funcionava e estava especialmente interessado em química. Ele começou a vender jornais na ferrovia aos 12 anos e aprendeu a operar um telégrafo. Em 1868, sua primeira invenção foi uma máquina eléctrica de registo de votos. Em 1869, ele fez melhorias no ticker da bolsa. Em 1876 ele mudou o seu laboratório para Menlo Park, N.J., onde inventou seu fonógrafo (1877) e o primeiro protótipo de uma lâmpada eléctrica incandescente comercialmente prática (1879). Outras invenções incluíram baterias de armazenamento, um ditafone e um mimeógrafo. No final da década de 1880, ele fez filmes e, em 1912, estava a fazer experiências com filmes falados. Edison desenvolveu energia eléctrica a partir de estações geradoras centrais. Ele se tornou conhecido internacionalmente como “o Mágico de Menlo Park”.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1866, o químico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Hofmann_(chemist)">Fritz Hofmann</a>. Ele polimerizou o isopreno para criar borracha sintética (1909) enquanto trabalhava como químico sénior para o vorm Elberfelder Farbenfabriken. Friedr. Bayer &amp; Co. O processo recebeu a primeira patente mundial para um “Método para produzir borracha sintética” (número alemão 250690 em 12 de Setembro de 1909). Começou a resolver o problema do alto custo da borracha natural conforme a necessidade aumentava na era do transporte motorizado. Hofmann seguiu a liderança revelada por Carl Dietrich Harries, que em 1905 quebrou a borracha natural usando ozónio para revelar que ela era formada por longas cadeias nas quais centenas de moléculas de isopreno estão ligadas. Hofmann também estudou a polimerização de butadieno e 2,3-dimetil butadieno.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1898, o físico húngaro-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Szilard">Leo Szilard</a>. Ele conjuntamente com Enrico Fermi, projectou o primeiro reactor nuclear que sustentou a reacção nuclear em cadeia (2 de Dezembro de 1942). Em 1933, Szilard trocou a Alemanha nazi pela Inglaterra. No mesmo ano, ele concebeu a reacção em cadeia de neutrões. Depois da mudança para Nova Iorque, em 1938, ele conduziu experiências de fissão na Universidade de Columbia. Ciente do perigo da fissão nuclear nas mãos do governo alemão, ele persuadiu Albert Einstein a escrever ao presidente Roosevelt, instando-o a encomendar o desenvolvimento americano de armas atómicas. Em 1943, o Major General Leslie Groves, líder do Projecto Manhattan que projectou a bomba atómica, forçou Szilard a vender seus direitos de patente de energia atómica ao governo dos Estados Unidos.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1915, o cientista da computação e matemático norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming">Richard Hamming</a>. Ele desenvolveu códigos de Hamming para computadores - códigos de detecção e correcção de erros (1947). Eles adicionam um ou mais bits à transmissão de blocos de dados, usados para uma verificação de paridade, para que os erros possam ser detectados e corrigidos automaticamente. Ao tornar desnecessário o reenvio de dados com erros, a eficiência melhorou para modems, discos compactos e comunicações por satélite. Ele também trabalhou em linguagens de programação, análise numérica e a janela espectral de Hamming (usada para suavizar dados antes da análise de Fourier ser realizada). Ele ensinou na Universidade de Louisville, então durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial trabalhou (1945) em computadores com o Projecto Manhattan para a criação da bomba atómica.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou ficámos a saber que chegaram à órbita de Marte, não uma mas duas sondas. A primeira que chegou "Amal" que significa esperança em árabe foi lançada à sete meses atrás e entrou no passado dia 9 de Fevereiro. Viajando a cerca de 120.000 Km/h (em relação ao Sol) a sonda precisou de executar uma queima durante 27 minutos para abrandar a velocidade. A manobra, realizada por seis propulsores da sonda, começou por volta das 19:30 GST (15:30 GMT), com confirmação recebida na Terra cerca de 11 minutos depois - sendo o atraso  relacionado com o tempo que os sinais de rádio levaram para atravessar o 190 milhões de quilómetros entre Marte e a Terra. Esta sonda foi enviada pelo Emirados Árabes Unidos é considerada um triunfo para uma pequena nação do golfo que ousou pensar, sete anos atrás, que poderia inspirar a próxima geração ao lançar a primeira missão espacial interplanetária árabe.</p>

<p>A segunda sonda, a Tianwen-1, foi lançada pela China em Julho do ano passado, e chegou à órbita de Marte no passado dia 10 de Fevereiro. Os engenheiros planearam uma queima de 14 minutos no propulsor de 3.000 newtons do orbitador, com a expectativa de que isso reduziria sua velocidade de 23 km/s o suficiente para permitir a captura da sonda pela gravidade de Marte. Esta sonda tem cerca de 5 toneladas e é composta por por um orbitador e por um rover solar. A ideia é larga o rover solar de cerca de 250 Kg numa região chamada Utopia Planitia, uma cratera gigante de 3300 km de diâmetro na superfície de Marte.</p>

<p>Para concluir, ainda é esperado que chegue mais uma sonda a Marte ainda este mês. Esta planeado para a próxima semana chegar a sonda Perseverance da NASA.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos assim como projetos de maker. É apresentada a revista newelectronics de 9 de Fevereiro.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-55998848">Emirates Mars Mission: Hope spacecraft enters orbit</a></h2>

<p><em>"The United Arab Emirates is celebrating its first mission at Mars. It has put a probe called Hope in orbit around the planet, making it only the fifth spacefaring entity to do so after the US, the Soviet Union, Europe and India. The spacecraft, which left Earth seven months ago, had to make a braking manoeuvre to be sure of being captured by Mars' gravity. UAE scientists can now look forward to studying the planet's atmosphere. Their satellite carries three instruments that will observe, among other targets, how neutral atoms of hydrogen and oxygen - remnants from Mars' once abundant water - leak into space. In the process, Hope will return spectacular, high-resolution, full-disk images of the planet."</em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-55998848">[...]</a>

<p><em>"China says it has successfully put its Tianwen-1 mission in orbit around Mars. It's the first time the country has managed to get a spacecraft to the Red Planet and comes a day after the United Arab Emirates accomplished the same feat. Tianwen-1, or "Questions to Heaven", comprises an orbiter and a rover. Engineers will bide their time before despatching the wheeled robot to the surface but the expectation is that this will happen in May or June. Wednesday's orbit insertion underlines again the rapid progress China's space programme is making. It follows December's impressive mission to retrieve rock and soil samples from Earth's Moon - by any measure a very complex undertaking."</em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-56013041">[...]</a>

Now, months later, the satellite has successfully passed what is known as the ‘in-orbit verification phase’, where its equipment is switched on and the instruments’ performance is checked. The Copernicus Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich satellite is the first of two identical satellites to provide critical measurements of sea-level change. The satellite carries a new digital altimeter, Poseidon-4, that uses dedicated onboard processing to return even more precise measurements of the height of the sea surface.

<p><em>"In 2018, the physics world was set ablaze with the discovery that when an ultrathin layer of carbon, called graphene, is stacked and twisted to a “magic angle,” that new double-layered structure converts into a superconductor, allowing electricity to flow without resistance or energy waste. Now, in a literal twist, Harvard scientists have expanded on that by adding a third layer and rotating it, opening the door for continued advancements in graphene-based superconductivity. The work is described in a new paper in Science, and eventually could lead toward superconductors that operate at higher temperatures — even close to room temperature. These superconductors are considered the Holy Grail of condensed-matter physics, as they would open the door to tremendous technological revolutions in many areas, including electricity transmission, transportation, and quantum computing. Most superconductors today, including the double-layered graphene system, work only at ultracold temperatures. “Superconductivity in twisted graphene provides physicists with an experimentally controllable and theoretically accessible model system where they can play with the system’s properties to decode the secrets of high-temperature superconductivity,” said one of the paper’s co-lead authors, Andrew Zimmerman, a postdoctoral researcher working in the lab of Harvard physicist Philip Kim."</em> <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2021/02/harvard-scientist-create-trilayer-graphene-superconductor/">[...]</a>

A collaboration between the Universities of Hong-Kong, Grenoble and Vienna, as well as the Austrian Academy of Sciences, under the lead of Philip Walther, reveals novel techniques to reduce noise in quantum communication. The results, published in the latest issue of "Physical Review Research", demonstrate that quantum particles traveling in a superposition of paths enable noise reduction in communications. Among the most active fields of research in modern physics, both at an academic level and beyond, are quantum computation and communication, which apply quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to perform calculations, or to exchange information.

This new chronology for Mars, based on the latest dynamical models for the formation and evolution of the solar system, is particularly significant as the days count down until NASA’s Mars 2020 Perseverance rover lands on the Red Planet on February 18, 2021. Unlike on Earth, where terrains are commonly dated using natural radioactivity of rocks, scientists have largely constrained the chronology of Mars by counting impact craters on its surface. “The idea behind crater dating is not rocket science; the more craters, the older the surface,” says SwRI’s Dr. Simone Marchi, who published a paper about these findings in The Astronomical Journal. “But the devil is in the details.

Three such university teams that recently were given allocations on these supercomputers include researchers from UC San Diego, Washington University in Saint Louis, and Washington State University. “We have been working on making lithium-ion batteries longer lasting and faster charging for many years,” said Shyue Ping Ong, associate professor of nanoengineering at UC San Diego. “Comet was crucial for performing the calculations to elucidate the unique lithium insertion and diffusion mechanisms responsible for the high-rate capability in a new anode material we are developing.” This new Li3V2O5 anode, which is a safer alternative to the typical graphite anode found in today’s lithium-ion batteries, was the focus of Ong’s recent publication in the journal Nature. The study was co-authored by UC San Diego’s Sustainable Power and Energy Director Ping Liu, who explained that this new anode approach can be cycled for more than 6,000 times with negligible capacity decay, and can charge and discharge energy rapidly, delivering over 40 percent of its capacity in 20 seconds."</em> <a href="https://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/supercomputers-advance-longer-lasting-faster-charging-batteries">[...]</a>

Since photons are essentially without mass and can travel faster than electrons, an optical computer would be superfast, energy-efficient and able to process information simultaneously through multiple temporal or spatial optical channels.

<p><em>"Individually, California blackworms live an unremarkable life eating microorganisms in ponds and serving as tropical fish food for aquarium enthusiasts. But together, tens, hundreds, or thousands of the centimeter-long creatures can collaborate to form a “worm blob,” a shape-shifting living liquid that collectively protects its members from drying out and helps them escape threats such as excessive heat. While other organisms form collective flocks, schools, or swarms for such purposes as mating, predation, and protection, the Lumbriculus variegatus worms are unusual in their ability to braid themselves together to accomplish tasks that unconnected individuals cannot. A new study reported by researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology describes how the worms self-organize to act as entangled “active matter,” creating surprising collective behaviors whose principles have been applied to help blobs of simple robots evolve their own locomotion. The research, supported by the National Science Foundation and the Army Research Office, was reported Feb. 5 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Findings from the work could help developers of swarm robots understand how emergent behavior of entangled active matter can produce unexpected, complex, and potentially useful mechanically driven behaviors."</em> <a href="https://news.gatech.edu/2021/02/10/collective-worm-and-robot-blobs-protect-individuals-swarm-together">[...]</a>

<p><em>"New research tackles a central challenge of powerful quantum computing To build a universal quantum computer from fragile quantum components, effective implementation of quantum error correction (QEC) is an essential requirement and a central challenge. QEC is used in quantum computing, which has the potential to solve scientific problems beyond the scope of supercomputers, to protect quantum information from errors due to various noise. Published by the journal Nature, research co-authored by University of Massachusetts Amherst physicist Chen Wang, graduate students Jeffrey Gertler and Shruti Shirol, and postdoctoral researcher Juliang Li takes a step toward building a fault-tolerant quantum computer. They have realized a novel type of QEC where the quantum errors are spontaneously corrected. Today’s computers are built with transistors representing classical bits (0’s or 1’s). Quantum computing is an exciting new paradigm of computation using quantum bits (qubits) where quantum superposition can be exploited for exponential gains in processing power."</em> <a href="https://www.umass.edu/newsoffice/article/umass-amherst-team-helps-demonstrate">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The new Raspberry Pi Pico is very different from a traditional Raspberry Pi. Pico is a microcontroller, rather than a microcomputer. Unlike a Raspberry Pi it’s a platform you develop for, not a platform you develop on. But you still have choices if you want to develop for Pico, because there is both a C/C++ SDK and an official MicroPython port. Beyond that there are other options opening up, with a port of CircuitPython from Adafruit and the prospect of Arduino support, or even a Rust port. Here I’m going to talk about how to get started with the C/C++ SDK, which lets you develop for Raspberry Pi Pico from your laptop or Raspberry Pi."</em> <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/how-to-blink-an-led-with-raspberry-pi-pico-in-c/">[...]</a>

Here it is in action: Inside the ball there's a microcontroller and a set of sensors that together with some clever algorithms allow the microcontroller to know the ball's absolute orientation in 3D. When the ball is rotated, it sends the appropriate commands to the computer over Bluetooth to move the mouse cursor. Oh, and the keyboard in the video is a completely separate USB device, it's only used for mouse clicks and doesn't interact with the ball in any way.

<p><em>"A joule thief takes a low DC voltage and boosts it up to a higher voltage. You can even take a battery that other devices will consider to be drained and get a bit more of the energy out of it. You won't get much current from it, but you can get enough to power a 3 volt LED with a battery that's drained to less than a volt. That's why it's referred to as a joule thief. It's almost like stealing energy from a dead battery. By the way, some people call it a zombie circuit for this same reason."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Easy-Joule-Thief-Circuit/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In past, we have published many brushed dc motor driver boards for various projects and usually, they have some sort of limitations, as some of them are large in size, require large size heatsink, doesn’t have current feedback, they don’t have overload protection, some require external large size current shunt resistor and after all, recently we have found the amazing DRV8874 chip from Texas instruments that has some amazing features and protections features. It has a small package and can handle high current without a heatsink. We quickly become fans of this chip, and after a few tests and experiments, we are sharing this open-source module. This chip can be used with PWM/DIR input, PWM input, and 2 x Half-Bridge for dual motor control. We have tested this project with PWM/DIR inputs, and all inputs and outputs of the chip are accessible using the header connector. Refer to the datasheet of DRV8874 to explore other features and configure the board as per requirement."</em> <a href="https://www.electronics-lab.com/project/h-bridge-motor-driver-with-integrated-current-sense-and-regulation-speed-control-direction-control-current-regulation-over-current-trip/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Edge computing a ML model on ESP8266 and finding different gesture made with hand. The world is certainly getting better everyday at technology based on gestures because it’s very intuitive, easy to use and clearly makes the interaction with gadgets and things around you futuristic and fancy! So, just to be on the trend we’ll be taking the watch we built in the previous hackster project and plunge in some ML and see if we can detect what kind of gesture we are performing, and maybe in upcoming tutorial we can use this gesture to perform some very cool projects based on this.

<p><em>"Have you ever wanted to have sensors scattered all around your house and garden reporting their temperature regularly to a central server? Then, this IoT project might be the solid launching point for you! This project uses ESP8266 NodeMCU as the control device that easily connects to existing WiFi network &amp; creates a Web Server. When any connected device accesses this web server, ESP8266 NodeMCU reads in temperature &amp; relative humidity from the DHT11, DHT22/AM2302 sensor &amp; sends it to the web browser of that device with a nice interface. Excited? Let’s get started!"</em> <a href="https://lastminuteengineers.com/esp8266-dht11-dht22-web-server-tutorial/">[...]</a>
