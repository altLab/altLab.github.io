<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1885, o físico dinamarquês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr">Niels Bohr</a>. Ele foi o primeiro a aplicar a teoria quântica, que restringe a energia de um sistema a certos valores discretos, ao problema da estrutura atómica e molecular. Por este trabalho, recebeu o Prémio Nobel da Física em 1922. Desenvolveu a chamada teoria de Bohr do átomo e modelo líquido do núcleo. Bohr era de origem judaica e quando os nazis ocuparam a Dinamarca escapou em 1943 para a Suécia, num barco de pesca. De lá foi transportado de avião para Inglaterra, onde começou a trabalhar no projecto de fazer uma bomba de fissão nuclear. Após alguns meses, foi com a equipa de investigação britânica para Los Alamos, nos EUA, onde continuou a trabalhar no projecto.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1939, o químico inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kroto">Harry Kroto</a>. Ele partilhou (com Richard E. Smalley e Robert F. Curl, Jr.) o Prémio Nobel da Química de 1996 pela sua descoberta conjunta dos compostos de carbono chamados fullerenes. Estas novas formas do elemento carbono contêm 60 ou mais átomos dispostos em conchas fechadas. O número de átomos de carbono na concha pode variar, e por esta razão numerosas novas estruturas de carbono tornaram-se conhecidas. Anteriormente, eram conhecidas seis formas cristalinas do elemento carbono, nomeadamente dois tipos de grafite, dois tipos de diamante, caoit (1968) e carbono(VI) (1972). Os fullerenos formam-se quando o carbono vaporizado condensa numa atmosfera de gás inerte. Os aglomerados de carbono podem então ser analisados com espectrometria de massa.</p>

<p>Em 1959 a sonda russa Luna 3 fotografava pela primeira vez o lado escuro da Lua. O objectivo da missão da sonda Luna 3 era fornecer as primeiras imagens do lado escuro da Lua. Para conseguir isto, a sonda foi equipada com uma câmara com uma lente de 35 mm, uma lente de 200 mm, com abertura de f/5.6, e outra câmara de 500 mm com f/9.5. A sequência de imagens foi automaticamente disparada quando a foto-célula da sonda Luna 3 detectou o lado escuro da Lua, o que aconteceu quando a sonda passava a aproximadamente 64370 quilómetros acima da superfície lunar.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou foi lançado oficialmente o Windows 11 da Microsoft. Focado na experiência do utilizador o Windows 11 é a nova proposta da Microsoft para o Desktop do PC. Refrescando a interface já habitual do Windows trás um conjunto de aspectos inovadores e que de alguma forma quebram com o passado. Este passa a ter requisitos superiores aos do Windows 10 nomeadamente no espaço em disco necessário que é de 64GB, processador de 1 Ghz com pelo menos 2 cores, 4GB de memória RAM e o sistema com capacidade de UEFI e TPM 2.0. Tem também que suportar um ecrã de 9 polegadas e 720p mínimo com uma placa gráfica compatível com o DirectX 12 ou superior com drivers WDDM 2.0.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker assim como alguns videos interessantes.</p>

<p><em>"Comprehensive open-source software tools facilitate CXL memory deployment without the need to modify system applications By supporting memory virtualization, the new software kit enables conventional and CXL-based memory to work together seamlessly and efficiently Samsung Electronics, the world leader in advanced memory technology, today introduced the first open-source software solution, the Scalable Memory Development Kit (SMDK), that has been specially designed to support the Compute Express Link (CXL) memory platform. In May, Samsung unveiled the industry’s first CXL memory expander that allows memory capacity and bandwidth to scale to levels far exceeding what is possible in today’s server systems. Now, the company’s CXL platform is being extended beyond hardware to offer easy-to-integrate software tools, making CXL memory much more accessible to data center system developers for emerging artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and 5G-edge markets. The CXL interconnect is an open, industry-backed standard that enables different types of devices such as accelerators, memory expanders and smart I/O devices to work more efficiently when processing high-performance computational workloads. “In order for data center and enterprise systems to smoothly run next-generation memory solutions like CXL, development of corresponding software is a necessity,” said Cheolmin Park, Vice President of the Memory Product Planning Team at Samsung Electronics. “Today, Samsung is reinforcing its commitment toward delivering a total memory solution that encompasses hardware and software, so that IT OEMs can incorporate new technologies into their systems much more effectively.” CXL Memory Adoption Made Easier Without the Need for Application Modifications Samsung’s SMDK enables the main memory and the CXL memory expander to work together seamlessly in heterogeneous memory systems."</em> <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-introduces-industrys-first-open-source-software-solution-for-cxl-memory-platform">[...]</a>

In the subsequent centuries, through experimentation and calculation, much has been learned about lightning, or plasma. But unanswered questions about the science of ultrafast processes such as plasma remain, the search for answers hindered in part by the limited technological capacity to capture images.

<p><em>"Movable airborne antennas receiving cellphone signals could reduce EMF exposure while offering higher data transmission speed and using less power. Mobile tethered drones might offer a speedy and environmentally friendly alternative for receiving terrestrial base stations while alleviating public concerns about exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF). A solution has been proposed by masters student Zhengying Lou, postdoctoral fellow Ahmed Elzanaty and distinguished professor Mohamed-Slim Alouini of KAUST to address the widespread public concern about EMF exposure from mobile networks. “It is mainly a problem of perception,” says Elzanaty, “but this concern has led to attempts to destroy signaling towers, especially those associated with the 5G network.” He does point out, however, that recent experiments on animals link some adverse health impacts with long-term exposure to EMF, although at higher intensities than those produced by cellphone networks. Given the widespread public concern, tackling this issue might be commercially and reputationally advantageous for mobile signal providers. Elzanaty says that although most public concern focuses on exposure to EMF from network base stations — the towers located on high buildings and dotted across the rural landscape — the EMF exposure due to the radiation from mobile phones can be much higher than that from base stations."</em> <a href="https://discovery.kaust.edu.sa/en/article/1173/airborne-antennas-to-address-emf-concerns">[...]</a>

The coating adhered more strongly to fabric than some conventional metal coatings, and eradicated 99% of several common pathogens within five minutes. “Microbes can survive on the fabrics hospitals use for bedding, clothing and face masks for a long time,” says Michael Dickey, co-corresponding author of a paper on the work and Camille &amp; Henry Dreyfus Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at North Carolina State University. “Metallic surface coatings such as copper or silver are an effective way to eradicate these pathogens, but many metal particle coating technologies have issues such as non-uniformity, processing complexity, or poor adhesion.” Dickey and colleagues from NC State, Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU) in Korea and RMIT University in Australia set out to develop a simple, cost-effective way to deposit metal coatings on fabric. First, the researchers placed liquid gallium (Ga) into an ethanol solution and used sound waves – a process known as sonication – to create Ga nanoparticles.

<p><em>"An international research team led by scientists at the University of Konstanz makes a path-breaking discovery in strontium ruthenate – with potential for new applications in quantum electronics Since the discovery of superconductivity in Sr2RuO4 in 1994, hundreds of studies have been published on this compound, which have suggested that Sr2RuO4 is a very special system with unique properties. These properties make Sr2RuO4 a material with great potential, for example, for the development of future technologies including superconducting spintronics and quantum electronics by virtue of its ability to carry lossless electrical currents and magnetic information simultaneously. An international research team led by scientists at the University of Konstanz has been now able to answer one of the most interesting open questions on Sr2RuO4: why does the superconducting state of this material exhibit some features that are typically found in materials known as ferromagnets, which are considered being antagonists to superconductors? The team has found that Sr2RuO4 hosts a new form of magnetism, which can coexist with superconductivity and exists independently of superconductivity as well. The results have been published in the current issue of Nature Communications. After a research study that lasted several years and involved 26 researchers from nine different universities and research institutions, the missing piece of the puzzle seems to have been found."</em> <a href="https://www.uni-konstanz.de/en/university/news-and-media/current-announcements/news-in-detail/neue-art-von-magnetismus-in-kult-material-entdeckt/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"New accelerator magnets are undergoing a rigorous training program to prepare them for the extreme conditions inside the upgraded Large Hadron Collider When training for a marathon, runners must gradually ramp up the distance of their runs. They know that their runs in the early days of training do not define what they will one day be capable of; they’re building a strong foundation that will help them reach their full potential. The car-length magnets that steer particles around the Large Hadron Collider go through a similar process. Scientists must push them to their limits, time and again, until they can handle enormous amounts of electrical current. “These magnets are great marvels of engineering,” says scientist Kathleen Amm, director of the Magnet Division at the US Department of Energy’s Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York. “But one thing we cannot do is put them straight into an accelerator."</em> <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=219179">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Automated vehicles could be made more pedestrian-friendly thanks to new research which could help predict when people will cross the road. Leeds scientists investigating how to better understand human behaviour in traffic say that neuroscientific theories of how the brain makes decisions can be used in automated vehicle technology to improve safety and make them more human-friendly. The researchers set out to determine whether a decision-making model called drift diffusion could predict when pedestrians would cross a road in front of approaching cars, and whether it could be used in scenarios where the car gives way to the pedestrian, either with or without explicit signals. This prediction capability will allow the autonomous vehicle to communicate more effectively with pedestrians, in terms of its movements in traffic and any external signals such as flashing lights, to maximise traffic flow and decrease uncertainty. Drift diffusion models assume that people reach decisions after accumulation of sensory evidence up to a threshold at which the decision is made. Professor Gustav Markkula, from the University’s Institute for Transport Studies, is senior author of the study."</em> <a href="https://www.leeds.ac.uk/news-technology/news/article/4931/making-self-driving-cars-human-friendly">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Flash Joule heating by Rice lab recovers precious metals from electronic waste in seconds In what should be a win-win-win for the environment, a process developed at Rice University to extract valuable metals from electronic waste would also use up to 500 times less energy than current lab methods and produce a byproduct clean enough for agricultural land. The flash Joule heating method introduced last year to produce graphene from carbon sources like waste food and plastic has been adapted to recover rhodium, palladium, gold and silver for reuse. A report in Nature Communications by the Rice lab of chemist James Tour also shows highly toxic heavy metals including chromium, arsenic, cadmium, mercury and lead are removed from the flashed materials, leaving a byproduct with minimal metal content. Instantly heating the waste to 3,400 Kelvin (5,660 degrees Fahrenheit) with a jolt of electricity vaporizes the precious metals, and the gases are vented away for separation, storage or disposal. Tour said that with more than 40 million tons of e-waste produced globally every year, there is plenty of potential for “urban mining.” “Here, the largest growing source of waste becomes a treasure,” Tour said. “This will curtail the need to go all over the world to mine from ores in remote and dangerous places, stripping the Earth’s surface and using gobs of water resources."</em> <a href="https://news.rice.edu/2021/10/04/urban-mining-for-metals-flashes-forward/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Fumbling to find flashlights during blackouts may soon be a distant memory, as quantum computing and artificial intelligence could learn to decipher an electric grid’s problematic quirks and solve system hiccups so fast, humans may not notice. Rather than energy grid faults turning into giant problems – such as voltage variations or widespread blackouts – blazing fast computation blended with artificial intelligence could rapidly diagnose trouble and find solutions in tiny splits of seconds, according to Cornell research forthcoming in Applied Energy (Dec. 1, 2021). “Energy power system failures are an old problem and we are still using classic computational methods to resolve them,” said Fengqi You, the Roxanne E. and Michael J. Zak Professor in Energy Systems Engineering in the College of Engineering. “Today’s power systems can benefit from AI and the computational power of quantum computing, so power systems can be stable and reliable.” You, along with doctoral student Akshay Ajagekar, are co-authors of “Quantum Computing-based Hybrid Deep Learning for Fault Diagnosis in Electrical Power Systems.” U.S. utilities generated about 4 trillion kilowatt hours in 2020, according to the federal U.S. Energy Information Administration (USEIA). This electricity is carried over regional grids, but due to storms, downed trees, ancient transmission lines and other misfortunes, outages occur. In 2016, for example, U.S. customers experienced on average more than four hours of electric energy interruption, while in 2017 that average rose to nearly eight hours, according to USEIA."</em> <a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2021/09/tying-quantum-computing-ai-prompts-smarter-power-grid">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In a surprising discovery, an international team of researchers, led by scientists in the University of Minnesota Center for Quantum Materials, found that deformations in quantum materials that cause imperfections in the crystal structure can actually improve the material’s superconducting and electrical properties. The groundbreaking findings could provide new insight for developing the next generation of quantum-based computing and electronic devices. The research just appeared in Nature Materials, a peer-reviewed scientific journal published by Nature Publishing Group. “Quantum materials have unusual magnetic and electrical properties that, if understood and controlled, could revolutionize virtually every aspect of society and enable highly energy-efficient electrical systems and faster, more accurate electronic devices,” said study co-author Martin Greven, a Distinguished McKnight Professor in the University of Minnesota’s School of Physics and Astronomy and the Director of the Center for Quantum Materials. “The ability to tune and modify the properties of quantum materials is pivotal to advances in both fundamental research and modern technology.” Elastic deformation of materials occurs when the material is subjected to stress but returns to its original shape once the stress is removed. In contrast, plastic deformation is the non-reversible change of a material’s shape in response to an applied stress—or, more simply, the act of squeezing or stretching it until it loses its shape."</em> <a href="https://twin-cities.umn.edu/news-events/induced-flaws-quantum-materials-could-enhance-superconducting-properties">[...]</a>

<p><em>"After various experiments and failed attempts to design a 7400-based computer, I came to a quite minimalistic 8-bit approach which is nevertheless pretty versatile and can utilize a surprisingly large amount of memory resources. The CPU core itself executes its program from a static 64K flash memory and can access 32 bytes of internal RAM (which can be considered registers for all practical purposes). Access to the external memory area (up to 16MB of address space) allows addition of RAM, ROM and memory mapped IO. In the current setup this directly mirrors the capabilities of my OS816 reference design. "</em> <a href="https://github.com/c0pperdragon/BreadBin">[...]</a>

The project is an ideal solution for a receiver for composite video signals that are transmitted over long distance on twisted-pair cables like CAT5. Category 5 cables are very common in office settings and are extensively used for data transmission. These cables can also be used for the analog transmission of signals such as video. These long cables pick up noise from the environment they pass through. This noise does not favour one conductor over another and therefore is a common-mode signal."</em> <a href="https://www.electronics-lab.com/project/twisted-pair-cable-cat5-composite-video-differential-receiver-amplifier/">[...]</a>
