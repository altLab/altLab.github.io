<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1580, o matemático francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Vernier">Pierre Vernier</a>. Ele inventou a escala Vernier, que permitiu aos instrumentos fazer medições lineares ou angulares mais precisas. Ele descreveu-a pela primeira vez numa obra intitulada La construction, l'usage et les propriétés du cadran nouveau (1631). Consiste numa pequena escala graduada ou arco feito para deslizar ao longo de uma escala fixa ou arco maior para permitir determinar o incremento entre duas graduações da escala maior. As dez divisões da escala menor, vernier, são iguais a nove da escala fixa. Por exemplo, os paquímetros com uma escala maior graduada em décimos de polegadas podem ser lidos através da utilização da escala de vernier até um centésimo de polegada. As escalas Vernier são também utilizadas em sextantes e barómetros de coluna de mercúrio.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1790, o relojoeiro e inventor inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_John_Dent">Edward John Dent</a>. Ele era especialista em fabricar cronómetros com elevada precisão. As suas patentes neste campo incluíam bússolas para navegação e topografia. Fez experiências com molas feitas de aço, ouro e vidro, e dispositivos para contrariar os efeitos das mudanças de temperatura sobre os mecanismos do relógio. Como relojoeiro da Rainha Vitória, foi encarregado de construir o Grande Relógio para a torre do relógio das Câmaras do Parlamento (conhecido como Big Ben, embora esse seja de facto o apelido do seu sino horário) que começou no ano da sua morte. O seu filho, Frederick Dent, completou a obra no ano seguinte e foi instalado na torre em 1859. Continua a ser reconhecido pela sua grande precisão de 4 segundos num ano.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1808, o engenheiro escocês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Nasmyth">James Nasmyth</a>. Ele inventou o martelo pneumático que foi patenteado na Grã-Bretanha em 9 de Junho de 1842 (No. 9382). No início da sua carreira, Nasmyth melhorou a concepção das máquinas-ferramentas. Os martelos eléctricos tinham sido anteriormente movidos a vapor, mas Nasmyth concebeu o seu martelo a vapor com mais precisão e controlo. O vapor funcionava para levantar o martelo, que depois caía por gravidade, e repetia o ciclo. Nasmyth adaptou a ideia para fazer um bate-estacas a vapor. Com melhorias posteriores, o martelo a vapor permitiu forjar armas muito grandes para a marinha britânica.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1830, o químico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lothar_Meyer">Lothar Meyer</a>. Ele descobriu a Lei Periódica, independentemente de Dmitry Mendeleyev, aproximadamente na mesma altura (1869). No entanto, ele não desenvolveu a classificação periódica dos elementos químicos de forma tão completa como Mendeleyev. Meyer formou-se originalmente em medicina e química. Ele examinou o efeito do monóxido de carbono no sangue. Em 1879, Meyer comparou o volume atómico com o peso atómico. Traçado num gráfico, a curva mostrava a periodicidade dos elementos. Ele também estabeleceu o conceito de valência indicando que um dado elemento combinado com um número característico de átomos de hidrogénio, e cunhou os termos como univalente, bivalente, e trivalente, com base nesse número.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1871, o inventor e aviador americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_brothers">Orville Wright</a>. Ele, com o seu irmão, Wilbur, inventou o primeiro avião motorizado, Flyer, capaz de um voo sustentado e controlado (17 Dez 1903). Em Kitty Hawk, na Carolina do Norte, Orville fez o primeiro voo tripulado com motor, que permaneceu no ar durante 12 segundos. Em 1905, tinham melhorado o design, construído e feito vários voos longos no Flyer III, que foi o primeiro avião totalmente prático (1905), capaz de voar até 38 minutos e viajar 24 milhas (39-km). O seu Modelo A foi produzido em 1908, capaz de voar durante mais de duas horas de voo. Venderam números consideráveis, mas os desenhadores europeus tornaram-se fortes concorrentes.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1883, o mineralogista russo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonid_Kulik">Leonid Kulik</a>. Ele conduziu a primeira expedição científica (cujos registos sobrevivem) para estudar o local de impacto do meteoro de Tungusta. Ele começou em 1927, e continuou a trabalhar na investigação até que, enquanto lutava pelo seu país na II Guerra Mundial, foi capturado e morreu de tifo num campo de prisioneiros nazi. O <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunguska_event">evento de Tungusta</a>, numa região remota da Rússia, foi uma explosão que destruiu 2.200 km2 de floresta, que se acredita ter sido causada por um meteorito com mais de 50 m de diâmetro. Penetrou na atmosfera da Terra, aquecida a cerca de 10.000 ºC e detonou 6 a 10 km acima do solo, não deixando nenhuma cratera. A região era escassamente povoada, remota e difícil de alcançar, pelo que houve pouco interesse científico até quase 20 anos mais tarde, quando Kulik começou o seu trabalho.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1906, o inventor americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo_Farnsworth">Philo Farnsworth</a>. Ele foi pioneiro no desenvolvimento da televisão electrónica, retirando todas as partes móveis das invenções televisivas. Farnsworth era um estudante de 15 anos do ensino secundário quando concebeu o seu primeiro sistema de televisão. Seis anos mais tarde, obteve a sua primeira patente. Em 1935, demonstrou o seu sistema de televisão completo. As patentes televisivas básicas de Farnsworth abrangiam a digitalização, focalização, sincronização, contraste, controlos e potência. Inventou também os primeiros tubos de raios catódicos frios e o primeiro microscópio electrónico simples. O fabrico da Philco TV recebeu o seu nome em homenagem a ele.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1923, o cientista da computação <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_F._Codd">Edgar F. Codd</a>. Ele, trabalhando na IBM, inventou o modelo relacional para a gestão de bases de dados, a base teórica para bases de dados relacionais e sistemas de gestão de bases de dados relacionais. Fez outras contribuições valiosas para a informática, mas o modelo relacional, uma teoria geral muito influente da gestão de dados, continua a ser o seu feito mais mencionado, analisado e celebrado.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1939, o matemático britânico <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Baker_(mathematician)">Alan Baker</a>. Ele foi galardoado com a Medalha Fields em 1970. Atribuída a cada quatro anos por descobertas extraordinárias em matemática, a Medalha é considerada a maior honra no campo e o equivalente ao Prémio Nobel. Este prémio foi pelo seu trabalho na Teoria do Número Transcendental. Desde a Antiguidade Grega, as pessoas tentavam "quadrar um círculo" (criar um quadrado com a mesma área que um círculo usando apenas uma régua e bússolas), mas provou ser impossível no século passado ao mostrar que pi é um número transcendental (um número que não é uma solução de uma equação polinomial com coeficientes inteiros). O trabalho de Baker aqui foi um avanço com <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_equation">equações de diophantine</a>. Baker também fez contribuições substanciais para o <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_seventh_problem">sétimo problema de Hilbert</a>.</p>

<p>Em 1960, o Sputnik 5 foi lançado na órbita da Terra, levando dois cães chamados Belka (Esquilo) e Strelka (Flecha Pequena), juntamente com 40 ratos, 2 ratos e uma variedade de plantas, iniciando uma viagem segura de ida e volta ao Espaço, após o que se tornam os primeiros organismos vivos a regressar ao espaço. Após um dia em órbita, o foguetão da nave espacial foi activado e a cápsula de aterragem regressou à Terra a 20 de Agosto.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou, foi lançada a nova versão da distribuição Debian.

<h2><a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-curiosity-mars-rover-explores-a-changing-landscape">NASA’s Curiosity Mars Rover Explores a Changing Landscape</a></h2>

<p><em>"A new video rings in the rover’s ninth year on Mars, letting viewers tour Curiosity’s location on a Martian mountain. Images of knobbly rocks and rounded hills are delighting scientists as NASA’s Curiosity rover climbs Mount Sharp, a 5-mile-tall (8-kilometer-tall) mountain within the 96-mile-wide (154-kilometer-wide) basin of Mars’ Gale Crater. The rover’s Mast Camera, or Mastcam, highlights those features in a panorama captured on July 3, 2021 (the 3,167th Martian day, or sol, of the mission). This location is particularly exciting: Spacecraft orbiting Mars show that Curiosity is now somewhere between a region enriched with clay minerals and one dominated by salty minerals called sulfates. The mountain’s layers in this area may reveal how the ancient environment within Gale Crater dried up over time. Similar changes are seen across the planet, and studying this region up close has been a major long-term goal for the mission."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-curiosity-mars-rover-explores-a-changing-landscape">[...]</a>

<p><em>"System uses tiny magnetic beads to rapidly measure the position of muscles and relay that information to a bionic prosthesis. For people with amputation who have prosthetic limbs, one of the greatest challenges is controlling the prosthesis so that it moves the same way a natural limb would. Most prosthetic limbs are controlled using electromyography, a way of recording electrical activity from the muscles, but this approach provides only limited control of the prosthesis. Researchers at MIT’s Media Lab have now developed an alternative approach that they believe could offer much more precise control of prosthetic limbs. After inserting small magnetic beads into muscle tissue within the amputated residuum, they can precisely measure the length of a muscle as it contracts, and this feedback can be relayed to a bionic prosthesis within milliseconds. In a new study appearing today in Science Robotics, the researchers tested their new strategy, called magnetomicrometry (MM), and showed that it can provide fast and accurate muscle measurements in animals."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/magnet-prosthetic-limb-control-0818">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A 10-quadrillion-watt burst at Lawrence Livermore is good news for LLE as well When researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory this week announced they had ignited a burst of more than 10 quadrillion watts of fusion power, it was cause for celebration at the University of Rochester’s Laboratory for Laser Energetics as well. The announcement validates the laser-driven implosion techniques that the two labs have closely collaborated on, as a way to assess the viability of the nation’s nuclear weapons stockpile and perhaps even pave the way for an abundant supply of clean energy. Even skeptics were impressed by the results of the August 8 experiment. In a story in the New York Times, for example, Stephen Bodner, a retired plasma physicist who has long been a critic of Lawrence Livermore’s National Ignition Facility (NIF), expressed surprise, adding, “they have come close enough to their goal of ignition and break-even to call it a success.” Says Riccardo Betti, LLE’s chief scientist and a leading expert in the field, “This really clears up a lot of the concern about the ability to ignite thermonuclear fuel in the lab, or that we would need much bigger lasers to do it. This is a major step forward.” Since the early 1970s, scientists have pursued the possibility of using high-power lasers to compress thermonuclear material long enough, at high enough temperatures to trigger ignition — resulting in an output of fusion energy many times greater than the energy required for ignition. The entire process of compression and ignition, which occurs in nanoseconds, is called inertial confinement fusion (ICF)."</em> <a href="https://www.lle.rochester.edu/index.php/2021/08/18/fusion-progress/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"New research published in Scientific Reports has revealed that a simple but robust algorithm can help engineers to improve the design of cellular materials that are used in a variety of diverse applications ranging from defence, bio-medical to smart structures and the aerospace sector. The way in which cellular materials will perform can be uncertain and so calculations to help engineers predict how they will react for a particular design, for a given set of loads, conditions and constraints, can help maximise their design and subsequent performance. The research collaborators at the Faculty of Science and Engineering, Swansea University, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi and Brown University, USA, found that running specialised calculations can help engineers to find the optimum micro-structure for cellular materials that are used for a wide range of purposes, from advanced aerospace applications to stents used for blocked arteries. Research author Dr Tanmoy Chatterjee said: “This paper is the result of one year of sustained collaborative research. The results illustrate that uncertainties in the micro-scale can drastically impact the mechanical performance of metamaterials. Our formulation achieved novel microstructure designs by employing computational algorithms which follow the evolutionary principles of nature.” Co-author Professor Sondipon Adhikari explains: “This approach allowed us to achieve extreme mechanical properties involving negative Poisson’s ratio (auxetic metamaterial) and elastic modulus."</em> <a href="https://www.swansea.ac.uk/press-office/news-events/news/2021/08/new-algorithm-can-help-improve-cellular-materials-design.php">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The feeding patterns of black holes offer insight into their size, researchers report. A new study revealed that the flickering in the brightness observed in actively feeding supermassive black holes is related to their mass. Supermassive black holes are millions to billions of times more massive than the sun and usually reside at the center of massive galaxies. When dormant and not feeding on the gas and stars surrounding them, SMBHs emit very little light; the only way astronomers can detect them is through their gravitational influences on stars and gas in their vicinity. However, in the early universe, when SMBHs were rapidly growing, they were actively feeding – or accreting – materials at intensive rates and emitting an enormous amount of radiation – sometimes outshining the entire galaxy in which they reside, the researchers said. The new study, led by the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign astronomy graduate student Colin Burke and professor Yue Shen, uncovered a definitive relationship between the mass of actively feeding SMBHs and the characteristic timescale in the light-flickering pattern."</em> <a href="https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/765220534">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Stress and strain, applied in just the right manner, can sometimes produce amazing results. That is what researchers, led by a team at UC Berkeley’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, discovered about an emerging semiconductor material — black phosphorus (BP) — used to make two types of optoelectronic devices: light emitting diodes (LEDs) and photodetectors. Under mechanical strain, BP can be induced to emit or detect infrared (IR) light in a range of desirable wavelengths — 2.3 to 5.5 micrometers, which spans the short- to mid-wave IR — and to do so reversibly at room temperature, according to study authors Ali Javey, Lam Research Distinguished Chair in Semiconductor Processing and professor of electrical engineering, and postdoctoral fellow Hyungjin Kim. Javey is also a faculty senior scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Their findings are significant not only for the ability to reach these wavelengths, Javey and Kim said, but to do so tunably and in one device.

Alone among known fundamental particles, they suffer from an identity crisis – if it were possible to put them on a weighing scale, you would unpredictably measure one of three possible masses. As a result, the three neutrino “flavours” merge into each other as they race through space and matter, opening up the potential for matter–antimatter asymmetries relevant to open questions in cosmology. Neutrinos are today the subject of a vibrant worldwide research programme in particle physics, astrophysics and multi-messenger astronomy. In an eye-catching example of international collaboration in particle physics, CERN has now agreed to produce a second cryostat for the detectors of the international Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) in the US.

<p><em>"A discovery that provides new insight into how galaxies evolve At the center of galaxies, like our own Milky Way, lie massive black holes surrounded by spinning gas. Some shine brightly, with a continuous supply of fuel, while others go dormant for millions of years, only to reawaken with a serendipitous influx of gas. It remains largely a mystery how gas flows across the universe to feed these massive black holes. UConn Assistant Professor of Physics Daniel Anglés-Alcázar, lead author on a paper published today in The Astrophysical Journal, addresses some of the questions surrounding these massive and enigmatic features of the universe by using new, high-powered simulations. “Supermassive black holes play a key role in galaxy evolution and we are trying to understand how they grow at the centers of galaxies,” says Anglés-Alcázar. “This is very important not just because black holes are very interesting objects on their own, as sources of gravitational waves and all sorts of interesting stuff, but also because we need to understand what the central black holes are doing if we want to understand how galaxies evolve.” Anglés-Alcázar, who is also an Associate Research Scientist at the Flatiron Institute Center for Computational Astrophysics, says a challenge in answering these questions has been creating models powerful enough to account for the numerous forces and factors that play into the process."</em> <a href="https://today.uconn.edu/2021/08/cracking-a-mystery-of-massive-black-holes-and-quasars-with-supercomputer-simulations/">[...]</a>

Quantum engineers from UNSW Sydney have removed a major obstacle that has stood in the way of quantum computers becoming a reality: they discovered a new technique they say will be capable of controlling millions of spin qubits – the basic units of information in a silicon quantum processor. Until now, quantum computer engineers and scientists have worked with a proof-of-concept model of quantum processors by demonstrating the control of only a handful of qubits. But with their latest research, published today in Science Advances, the team have found what they consider ‘the missing jigsaw piece’ in the quantum computer architecture that should enable the control of the millions of qubits needed for extraordinarily complex calculations. Dr Jarryd Pla, a faculty member in UNSW’s School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications says his research team wanted to crack the problem that had stumped quantum computer scientists for decades: how to control not just a few, but millions of qubits without taking up valuable space with more wiring, using more electricity, and generating more heat. “Up until this point, controlling electron spin qubits relied on us delivering microwave magnetic fields by putting a current through a wire right beside the qubit,” Dr Pla says."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/science-tech/missing-jigsaw-piece-engineers-make-critical-advance-quantum-computer-design">[...]</a>

Demand for these metals is mounting as countries around the world seek to lower vehicle emissions that accelerate climate change and worsen air quality.

Electrons have a property called spin, which can be crudely thought of as the rotation of an electron about an axis. As an electron moves, its motion and spin can become linked through an effect known as spin–orbit coupling. This effect is useful because it offers a way to externally control the motion of an electron depending on its spin—a vital ability for an emerging technology called spintronics, which is seeking to use electron spin to realize low-power-consumption information processing. Spin–orbit coupling is a complex mix of quantum physics and relativity, but it becomes a little easier to understand by envisioning a round soccer ball. “If a soccer player kicks the ball, it flies on a straight trajectory,” explains Denis Maryenko of the RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science."</em> <a href="https://www.riken.jp/en/news_pubs/research_news/rr/20210819_1/index.html">[...]</a>

This paradox motivated laboratory experiments and theoretical investigations, which instead of providing a solution, raised new issues and even led some scientists to question the quantum theory of matter-radiation interaction. Today, researchers at the Istituto Ricerche Solari (IRSOL) in Locarno-Monti (affiliated to USI Università della Svizzera italiana), and the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (IAC) in Tenerife, have found the solution to such intriguing paradox, opening up a new window for exploring the elusive magnetic fields of the solar chromosphere in the present new era of large-aperture solar telescopes. Their findings are now published in Physical Review Letters, the prestigious scientific journal of the American Physical Society. Twenty-five years ago, an enigmatic signal was discovered while analysing the polarization of sunlight with a new instrument, the Zurich Imaging Polarimeter (ZIMPOL), developed at ETH Zurich and later installed at IRSOL. This mysterious linear polarization signal, produced by scattering processes, appears at the wavelength of a neutral sodium line (the so-called D1 line) where, according to quantum mechanics, no such scattering polarization should be present."</em> <a href="https://www.usi.ch/en/feeds/16643">[...]</a>

The die photo below shows the UC3842 chip, which was very popular in older PC power supplies.1 (The chip was introduced in 1984 but this die has a date of 2000.) The tiny silicon die is patterned to create the transistors, resistors and capacitors that make up the circuit. The lighter-colored lines are the metal layer on top of the silicon, forming the chip's wiring. Around the edges, square pads provide the connections from the die to the IC's external pins; tiny bond wires connect the pads to the chip's external pins.

For my senior design project in college, I wanted to create a new robot where all of the control logic would be integrated onto a single chip, and so Pet on a Chip was born. This new robot improved upon the original by drastically reducing power consumption, size, weight, and improving maneuverability, and all of the control logic was implemented on an FPGA. This project built off of my TinySoC project I had worked on during the summer. The robot’s FPGA contains the following modules: - A custom 8-bit CPU with on-chip memory - A simple text mode VGA graphics controller - Twin closed loop motor speed controllers - A servo controller - An interface to a sonar module - A UART - Counter/Timers - GPIO"</em> <a href="https://ezrasrobots.wordpress.com/2021/07/07/pet-on-a-chip/">[...]</a>
