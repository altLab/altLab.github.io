<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1201, o filósofo, cientista, matemático e astrónomo persa <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasir_al-Din_al-Tusi">Nasir al-Din al-Tusi</a>. Ele fez contribuições notáveis na sua época. Quando a invasão mongol, iniciada por Genghis Khan, o alcançou em 1256, ele escapou da provável morte juntando-se aos vitoriosos mongóis como conselheiro científico. Ele usou um observatório construído em Maragheh (concluído em 1262), assistido por astrónomos chineses. Ele tinha vários instrumentos, como um quadrante de parede de 4 metros feito de cobre e um quadrante de azimute que foi invenção do próprio Tusi. Usando movimentos planetários desenhados com precisão, ele modificou o modelo do sistema planetário de Ptolomeu baseado em princípios mecânicos. O observatório e a sua biblioteca tornaram-se um centro para uma ampla gama de trabalhos em ciências, matemática e filosofia. Ele era conhecido pelo título de Tusi pelo seu local de nascimento (Tus).</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1745, o físico italiano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Volta">Alessandro Volta</a>. Ele inventou a bateria eléctrica (1800), que foi o primeiro fornecimento confiável e sustentado de corrente. A sua pilha voltaica usava placas de dois metais diferentes e um electrólito, vários discos alternados de zinco e prata, cada um separado por papelão embebido em salmoura porosa. Anteriormente, apenas a descarga de electricidade estática estava disponível, então o seu dispositivo permitia novos usos de electricidade. (Logo, com a electrólise, William Nicholson decompôs a água e Humphry Davy isolou o potássio e outros metais.) Volta também inventou o electróforo, o condensador e o electroscópio. Ele contribuiu para a meteorologia, estudou gases e descobriu o metano. O volt, uma unidade de medida da tensão eléctrica, tem o seu nome.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1838, o físico e filósofo austríaco <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Mach">Ernst Mach</a>. Ele estabeleceu princípios importantes de óptica, mecânica e dinâmica de ondas. Os seus primeiros trabalhos físicos foram dedicados à descarga eléctrica e indução. Entre 1860 e 1862, ele estudou em profundidade o Efeito Doppler por meio de experiências ópticas e acústicas. Ele introduziu o “número de Mach” para a relação entre a velocidade do objecto e a velocidade do som que recebeu seu nome. Quando os aviões supersónicos viajam hoje, sua velocidade é medida em termos que mantêm o nome de Mach vivo. O seu interesse profundo, no entanto, foi em psicologia e percepção humana. Ele apoiou que a visão de que todo conhecimento é uma organização conceptual dos dados da experiência sensorial (ou observação).</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1871, o estatístico escocês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udny_Yule">Udny Yule</a>. Ele, juntamente com Karl Pearson, estudou as estatísticas de regressão e correlação, especialmente as aplicadas em tabelas de contingência 2x2, séries temporais, genética mendeliana e epidemiologia. O seu nome é lembrado na distribuição de Yule (uma lei de potência discreta). O primeiro artigo de Yule sobre estatísticas, On the Correlation of Total Pauperism with Proportion of Out-relief (1895), reflecte seu interesse inicial em estatísticas aplicadas a problemas sociais. Como um dos pioneiros da estatística moderna, ele lançou uma base sobre a qual outros posteriormente construíram. Yule também fez algumas declarações pioneiras sobre os testes mentais, como reduzir o erro de medição e, assim, melhorar a validade. Desenvolvido a partir de sua série anterior de palestras, ele escreveu um livro-texto amplamente utilizado, Introdução à Estatística (1911), que teve 14 edições.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1871, o Metalúrgico inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Brearley">Harry Brearley</a>. Ele é responsável pela invenção do aço inoxidável, que é uma liga de aço com cromo e níquel. Em 1912, ele estava a investigar a corrosão de canos de espingardas porque o seu diâmetro interno foi rapidamente corroído pela acção do aquecimento e da descarga de gases. A sua solução foi desenvolver uma liga de aço com cromo que fosse muito mais resistente à ferrugem do que o aço de uso comum. Os metais adicionados produzem uma película superficial de óxidos metálicos que resiste à ferrugem. Portanto, foi denominado aço inoxidável. Ele também percebeu como isso poderia revolucionar a indústria da cutelaria. Até então, os talheres de mesa eram banhados a prata ou níquel e as facas de corte de aço carbono tinham que ser bem lavadas e secas após o uso, e mesmo assim as manchas de ferrugem teriam que ser removidas.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou foi lançada mais uma versão do Kernel Linux. Linus Torvalds lançou no passado domingo dia 14 a versão 5.11 do Kernel de Linux. Esta versão não é LTS, sendo no entanto a primeira lançada em 2021. De entre as principais mudanças destaca-se o suporte para Wi-Fi 6, melhorias no desempenho dos CPU AMD, suporte gráfico Intel Iris Xe, suporte AMD Van Gogh APU e muito mais. Foram também introduzidas melhorias significativas e suporte para a arquitectura de CPU RISC-V, incluindo suporte OpenRISC para o driver do controlador LiteX SoC e suporte geral para o SoC.</p>

<p>Hoje ao inicio da noite aterrou com sucesso o rover Perseverance na superfície de Marte. Lançado a bordo do foguetão Atlas V a 30 de Julho de 2020, foi a terceira sonda a chegar a Marte no espaço de 1 semana. O Rover Perseverance acompanhado pelo drone Ingenuity irão agora explorar a superfície de Marte, conduzindo um conjunto muito alargado de experiências e a tentativa de extracção de amostras para que possam no futuro ser enviadas para a Terra para serem estudadas. "O rover Perseverance é o geólogo robótico mais sofisticado já construído, mas verificar se a vida microscópica já existiu carrega um enorme ónus de prova", disse Lori Glaze, directora da Divisão de Ciência Planetária da NASA. “Embora possamos aprender muito com os grandes instrumentos que temos a bordo do rover, pode muito bem exigir que laboratórios e instrumentos muito mais capazes aqui na Terra nos digam se nossas amostras carregam evidências de que Marte já abrigou vida.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos assim como projetos de maker. É apresentada a revista HackSpace  nº 40 de Março e os livros "Making Servers Work" e "Foundations of Machine Learning, Second Edition". Nesta semana abrimos uma nova secção com vídeos que apresentam projectos ou que abordam assuntos que são interessantes.</p>

<p><em>"New high-side current sense amplifier offers the industry’s lowest offset for AEC-Q100 Grade 0 qualified devices, enabling a more accurate and energy efficient current measurement solution for those applications exposed to extreme temperatures With the proliferation of automation and connectivity throughout the automotive and industrial markets, the need to accurately measure a dynamic current in the presence of high frequency noise often plagues modern vehicle and factory applications. In order to combat electrically noisy environments and address the need for higher accuracy current measurement, Microchip Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP) today introduced its high-side current sense amplifiers — featuring the industry’s lowest offset for AEC-Q100 Grade 0 qualified high-side current sense amplifier devices. AEC-Q100 qualified, the MCP6C02 amplifier is offered in both a Grade 1 6-pin SOT-23 package and a Grade 0 8-pin 3x3 VDFN package. Delivering a maximum offset error of only 12 µV, the VDFN package offers the lowest offset voltage for any Grade 0 high-side current sense amplifier. Specified over a temperature range of -40°C to +150°C, its market-leading offset error allows the use of smaller value shunt resistors while also maintaining a high measurement resolution. This enables a more accurate and energy efficient current measurement solution for those applications exposed to extreme temperatures, like the motor within a vehicle’s water pump."</em> <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/about/news-releases/products/microchip-delivers-accuracy-and-energy-efficiency-of-current-mon">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/spacex-launches-starlink-satellites-landing-fail/">SpaceX launches 60 more Starlink satellites but attempted landing of booster fails</a></h2>

<p><em>"Running a day late because of bad weather, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket boosted 60 more Starlink internet satellites into orbit late Monday from Cape Canaveral. An attempt to recover the first stage with a landing on an off-shore droneship failed, ending a string of 24 successes in a row. Another Starlink launch, with another 60 satellites on board, is planned for early Wednesday from the nearby Kennedy Space Center as SpaceX presses ahead with building out a globe-spanning constellation designed to deliver internet access to customers around the world. What impact, if any, the landing mishap might have on Wednesday's flight is not yet known. Monday's flight got off to a spectacular start at 10:59 p.m. EST when the Falcon 9 rocket's nine first stage engines ignited with a burst of fire, 229 pushing the 229-foot-tall booster away from pad 40 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. Generating 1.7 million pounds of thrust, the engines powered the rocket away on a northeasterly trajectory, rapidly accelerating as they consumed propellants and the vehicle lost weight."</em> <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/spacex-launches-starlink-satellites-landing-fail/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Sony Corporation announced today that it has developed a stacked direct Time of Flight (dToF) depth sensor for automotive LiDAR using single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) pixels, an industry first. *1 This achievement was announced at the International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC), which opened on February 13, 2021. In addition to sensing devices such as cameras and millimeter wave radar, LiDAR is becoming ever more important as a method of high-precision detection and recognition of not only road conditions but also the location and shape of objects such as vehicles and pedestrians. This trend is being driven by the popularization of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and the need for this technology in autonomous driving (AD). SPAD is a pixel structure that uses avalanche multiplication to amplify electrons from a single incident photon, causing a cascade like an avalanche, and it can detect even weak light. It is possible to accomplish long-distance, high-precision distance measuring by employing SPAD as the detector in a dToF sensor, which measures the distance to an object based on the time of flight (time difference) of a light emitted from a light source until it returns to the sensor, after being reflected by the object."</em> <a href="https://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press/202102/21-016E/">[...]</a>

Applications include low-cost robotics for entertainment, such as toys, and robots that can operate in environments where electronics cannot function, such as MRI machines or mine shafts.

An international team of experts, led by the University of Nottingham, have demonstrated that only quantum and not classical gravity could be used to create a certain informatic ingredient that is needed for quantum computation. Their research “Non-Gaussianity as a signature of a quantum theory of gravity” has been published today in PRX Quantum. Dr Richard Howl led the research during his time at the University of Nottingham’s School of Mathematics, he said: “For more than a hundred years, physicists have struggled to determine how the two foundational theories of science, quantum theory and general relativity, which respectively describe microscopic and macroscopic phenomena, are unified into a single overarching theory of nature. During this time, they have come up with two fundamentally contrasting approaches, called ‘quantum gravity’ and ‘classical gravity’. However, a complete lack of experimental evidence means that physicists do not know which approach the overarching theory actually takes, our research provides an experimental approach to solving this.” This new research, which is a collaboration between experts in quantum computing, quantum gravity, and quantum experiments finds an unexpected connection between the fields of quantum computing and quantum gravity and uses this to propose a way to test experimentally that there is quantum not classical gravity."</em> <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/quantum-collaboration-gives-new-gravity-to-the-mysteries-of-the-universe">[...]</a>

Using lasers to control an electron, the researchers could then use that electron to control the behaviour of the haystack, making it easier to find the needle. They were able to detect the ‘needle’ with a precision of 1.9 parts per million: high enough to detect a single quantum bit in this large ensemble.

A team of researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) used a quantum computer to successfully simulate an aspect of particle collisions that is typically neglected in high-energy physics experiments, such as those that occur at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider. The quantum algorithm they developed accounts for the complexity of parton showers, which are complicated bursts of particles produced in the collisions that involve particle production and decay processes. Classical algorithms typically used to model parton showers, such as the popular Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms, overlook several quantum-based effects, the researchers note in a study published online Feb. 10 in the journal Physical Review Letters that details their quantum algorithm. “We’ve essentially shown that you can put a parton shower on a quantum computer with efficient resources,” said Christian Bauer, who is Theory Group leader and serves as principal investigator for quantum computing efforts in Berkeley Lab’s Physics Division, “and we’ve shown there are certain quantum effects that are difficult to describe on a classical computer that you could describe on a quantum computer.” Bauer led the recent study. Their approach meshes quantum and classical computing: It uses the quantum solution only for the part of the particle collisions that cannot be addressed with classical computing, and uses classical computing to address all of the other aspects of the particle collisions."</em> <a href="https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2021/02/12/applying-quantum-computing-to-a-particle-process/">[...]</a>

The emergence of tiny neural networks, which are as small as 14 KB, opens a plethora of doors to new applications that can analyze data right on the microprocessor itself and derive actionable insights (Warden and Situnayake, 2019). This saves time and prevents latency because we do not have to transmit data to a cloud data center for it to be processed and wait for it to come back (Warden and Situnayake, 2019). Such a phenomenon is called Edge Computing and allows for data to be processed and computed on the device that it is stored (Lea, 2020).

<p><em>"For me, this is one of those projects that Ive been wanting to build for years but could never seem to get around to it. Well now I have. Taking inspiration from other drill press tables Ive seen, I set out to design my own. I used the Fusion 360 design program to do so. I love this program for the amount of detail it offers and the ability to make highly detailed building plans straight from the program. And, speaking of building plans, if you are interested in the plans for this build, you can get them from my website."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Drill-Press-Table-With-Dust-Collection/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"There are many countries and people who depend on the water tank to get the water for their home as I am. In the lockdown, my dad keeps climbing the stairs to know the water level and to secure our home needs from water, and it is very dangerous to go up the stairs every day, so I decided to make a water level indicator to save my dad and let him see the water level on his couch. I made 6 levels of water indicator with a temporary alarm &amp; water flow sensor. Buy or DIY, I preferred to make it by myself because it will be cheaper and has more options didn't available in the market. Supplies: This water level indicator is easy for everyone to make at home with simple materials, you need: Circuit components Box Ethernet cable or any 8 wires cable Tube Hot glue Solder iron Drill"</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Water-Level-Indicator-With-Temporary-Alarm-Water-F/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Hey guys what's up So this is my RGB Mask project that is made from soldering 5 PCBs together, This RGB mask has 52 WS2812B LEDs and they are controlled by an ESP8266 microcontroller module. BUT Does this work as an actual face mask? No, not really but we can wear a normal mask beneath this RGB mask and stay safe. I first made a cardboard mask and then use its measurements for making a PCB design which has solderings pads on edge of PCB. by putting PCBs together in the right order and soldering them at a certain angle, we can combine two or more 2 PCBs to create a PCB structure or shape. with this method, we can make anything with PCBs even a PCB Hat or Iron man's Helmet, we just need to follow the basic geometry and that's pretty much it."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Overengineered-RGB-Mask/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Before digital photography entered our lives and became ubiquitous, people had their photos printed on paper, and they made slide shows. From the 1950s through to the 1970s, boring friends and family with slides of vacations or weddings was an accepted pastime. There was no internet, people didn't know any better. Although we now have Facebook and Instagram to share family photos (I'll leave it for you to decide if that is an improvement), the remnants of the Kodachrome era are still in a lot of people's attics. Boxes full of 35 mm slides are still taking up space. To remedy that, people buy a slide scanner, only to find out that scanning a big collection is a *lot* of work."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Super-fast-DIY-Slide-Scanner/">[...]</a>

In my Feather MK26F board, it is called FLEXBUS, and the equivalent can be found in other microcontrollers. So the remarkable feature for me of this microcontroller are: XIP( Execute in place ) The ability to save and execute programs running on an external 2MB-16MB QUAD-SPI flash. 246Kb of RAM, that is a lot of RAM, mostly seen on mid-range microcontrollers. 133 Mhz Cortex M0+ dual-core 8 PIO, Programmable IO State machines.

<p><em>"A small voltmeter that sits on a breadboard's power rails I wanted to try out the ATtiny85 and get some practice hand-soldering QFN components, so I built a basic voltmeter that sits on the power rails of a breadboard. Features * Displays power supply voltage, rounded to the nearest volt * Reversible - cannot be inserted incorrectly * Low power consumption - below 3mA * Small - only takes up a single 2x5 block of pins on a standard breadboard power rail Some things I'd do differently next time: Include a programming header for the ATtiny85. I had to solder it some 30 awg wire-wrap wire to existing PCB pads to program the ATtiny before adding any other components. Use regular 0603 resistors instead of a resistor network. I ended up ordering the wrong size network and had to use discrete resistors anyway. Show non-integer voltages by adjusting the relative brightness of adjacent LEDs."</em> <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/177768-breadboard-voltmeter">[...]</a>
