<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1608, o Matemático e físico italiano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Alfonso_Borelli">Giovanni Alfonso Borelli</a>. Ele foi o primeiro a aplicar as leis da mecânica à acção muscular do corpo humano. Em De motu animalium (Concerning Animal Motion, 1680), ele descreveu correctamente o esqueleto e os músculos como um sistema de alavancas e explicou o mecanismo do voo dos pássaros. Ele calculou as forças necessárias para o equilíbrio em várias articulações do corpo muito antes da mecânica de Isaac Newton. Ele fez dissecações anatómicas, desenhou um respirador de mergulho, investigou vulcões, foi o primeiro a sugerir um caminho parabólico para cometas e considerou que Júpiter tinha uma influência de atracção nas suas luas.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1857, o Inventor americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Seward_Burroughs_I">William Seward Burroughs</a>. Ele inventou a primeira máquina de somar com gravação comercialmente viável do mundo e foi pioneiro na sua fabricação. Ele foi inspirado pela sua experiência no início da sua carreira como caixa de banco. A 10 de Janeiro de 1885, ele apresentou a sua primeira patente para a sua "máquina de calcular" mecânica. Burroughs foi co-fundador da American Arithmometer Co em 1886 para desenvolver e comercializar a máquina. A empresa mais tarde se tornou Burroughs Corporation (1905) e, eventualmente, Unisys.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1884, os irmãos <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Piccard">Jean Piccard</a> e <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_Piccard">Auguste Piccard</a>. Jean era um engenheiro químico e balonista suíço-americano e Auguste era um físico suíço-belga e balonista. A sua primeira subida de balão foi em 1913. Em 1934, Jean faz o primeiro voo estratosférico bem-sucedido através das nuvens, subindo a uma altura de 18 km acompanhada da sua esposa. Em 1936, Jean voou com sucesso o primeiro balão de filme plástico, que ele inventou e desenvolveu, o precursor do balão de filme plástico para experiências de alta altitude ainda usados para fins científicos. Em 1937, ele fez uma subida de 3.350 metros para testar uma gôndola de metal presa a um aglomerado de 98 balões. Ele também desenvolveu uma janela resistente ao gelo para gôndolas de balão e um sistema electrónico para esvaziar os sacos de lastro. Por outro lado, Auguste, para além da alta estratosfera, explorou as profundezas do mar em navios de sua própria autoria. Em 1930 ele construiu um balão para estudar os raios cósmicos. Em 1932 ele desenvolveu um novo projecto de cabine para balões e no mesmo ano subiu de balão numa gôndola pressurizada até 16.916 m. Em voos posteriores, ele alcançou 72.000 pés. Ele cunhou a palavra batiscafo para designar o seu navio de mergulho profundo navegável. Em 1954, um bastiscafo atingiu a 4.176 m de profundidade.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1886, o engenheiro electrotécnico japonês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidetsugu_Yagi">Hidetsugu Yagi</a>. Ele ficou conhecido por ter desenvolvido juntamente com Shintaro Uda em 1926 a antena Yagi. O seu formato permite a comunicação direccional usando ondas electromagnéticas e agora está instalada em milhões de residências em todo o mundo para recepção de rádio e televisão.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1903, a Cristalógrafa britânica <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Lonsdale">Kathleen Lonsdale</a>. Ela desenvolveu várias técnicas de raios-X para o estudo da estrutura cristalina. A sua determinação experimental da estrutura do anel de benzeno por difração de raios-X, que mostrou que todas as ligações C-C do anel eram do mesmo comprimento e todos os ângulos das ligações C-C-C internas eram de 120 graus, teve um enorme impacto na química orgânica. Ela foi a primeira mulher a ser eleita (1945) para a Royal Society of London.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1905, o inventor americano de origem turca <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luther_Simjian">Luther Simjian</a>. Ele foi responsável por mais de 200 invenções que incluíram o TelePrompter, uma câmara de retratos, equipamento de medição automática de postagem e um campo de prática de golfe coberto. Na Segunda Guerra Mundial, o seu Range Estimation Trainer forneceu um simulador para os pilotos aprenderem a identificar os tipos de aeronaves, sua distância e velocidade. Ele usava espelhos móveis sincronizados, iluminação controlada e um avião em miniatura para apresentar várias velocidades, iluminação e ângulos.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1922, o bioquímico americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_W._Holley">Robert W. Holley</a>. Ele partilhou o Prémio Nobel da Medicina de 1968 (com Marshall Warren Nirenberg e Har Gobind Khorana). Os três cientistas conduziram de forma independente pesquisas que ajudaram a decifrar quimicamente o código genético e a explicar como a informação genética armazenada no DNA de uma célula controla a síntese de proteínas, os blocos de construção das células.</p>

<p>Em 1887 começava a construção da torre Eiffel em Paris. A sua construção demorou pouco mais de 2 anos e durante os 41 anos seguintes foi o edifício mais alto construído pelo Homem com 324 metros de altura.</p>

<p>Hoje é também, o Dia Internacional do LEGO, marcando 63 anos desde que Godtfred Kirk Christiansen patenteou a peça de LEGO 2 × 4 original. Esta não foi a primeira vez que a peça de LEGO chegou às mãos de crianças, é claro. Na verdade, ela já estava à venda há cerca de nove anos - mas a 28 de Janeiro de 1958 às 13:58 que o filho do fundador da empresa registou a patente do desenho.</p>

<p>Também neste dia, mas em 1998, Andy Nelson e o navegador Bertrand Piccard, no Breitling Orbiter II, partiram para estabelecer o recorde mundial de resistência em nove dias e 17 horas - ou, para ser exato, 233 horas e 55 minutos. A viagem foi interrompida quando eles não puderam sobrevoar a China. A preparação durou mais de quatro anos com uma equipa de 13 pessoas. Bertrand é neto do pioneiro do voo em balão, Auguste Piccard.</p>

<p>Faz hoje 35 anos que se deu o <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/35-years-ago-remembering-challenger-and-her-crew">desastre do Space Shuttle Challenger</a>. Após alguns segundos da sua descolagem o vaivém explode e mata todos os seus 7 tripulantes. A investigação às causas do acidente determinou que a cultura organizacional e os processos de tomada de decisão da NASA foram factores chave para que contribuíram para o acidente, com a agência a violar as suas próprias regras de segurança. Desde 1977 que era conhecido um problema no desenho dos SRB (Solid Rocket Booster) que continha uma potencial falha catastrófica nos anéis de vedação. A gestão da NASA ignorou os avisos dos engenheiros que existiam perigos do lançamento ser efectuado nas condições de baixas temperaturas que estavam a ocorrer naquela manhã. A frota de Space Shuttles era constituída por quatro vaivéns operacionais, o Columbia, o Challenger, o Discovery e o Atlantis. Posteriormente foi construído o Endeavour para substituir o Challenger. Houve mais um acidente catastrófico com o Columbia em 2003. No total, foram feitas 133 missões com sucesso entre 1981 e 2011.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou a SpaceX bateu mais um recorde, colocando em orbita 143 satélites num único lançamento. O foguetão Falcon 9 descolou às 10h EST do Complexo de Lançamento Espacial 40 na Estação da Força Espacial de Cabo Canaveral, na Flórida. O foguetão reutilizável transportou 133 satélites comerciais e governamentais e 10 satélites Starlink para o espaço.</p>

<p>A Newsletter desta semana tem um número redondo de 300, sendo publicada semanalmente sem interrupções. Trata-se de um feito que nem eu próprio acreditaria se me tivessem dito no início desta aventura.

<h2><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN29T0OI">Need a lift? SpaceX launches record spacecraft in cosmic rideshare program</a></h2>

<p><em>"A veteran rocket from billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk’s SpaceX aerospace company launched 143 spacecraft into space on Sunday, a new record for the most spaceships deployed on a single mission, according to the company. The Falcon 9 rocket lifted off at 10 a.m. EST from the Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. It flew south along the eastern coast of Florida on its way to space, the company said. The reusable rocket ferried 133 commercial and government spacecraft and 10 Starlink satellites to space - part of the company’s SmallSat Rideshare Program, which provides access to space for small satellite operators seeking a reliable, affordable ride to orbit, according to the company. SpaceX delayed the launch one day because of unfavorable weather. On Jan. 22 Musk, also chief executive of Tesla Inc., wrote on Twitter: “Launching many small satellites for a wide range of customers tomorrow."</em> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN29T0OI">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/ames/ptd-1">NASA CubeSat to Demonstrate Water-Fueled Moves in Space</a></h2>

<p><em>"A NASA CubeSat will launch into low-Earth orbit to demonstrate a new type of propulsion system. Carrying a pint of liquid water as fuel, the system will split the water into hydrogen and oxygen in space and burn them in a tiny rocket engine for thrust. NASA’s Pathfinder Technology Demonstrator, or PTD, series of missions demonstrates novel CubeSat technologies in low-Earth orbit, providing significant enhancements to the performance of these small and effective spacecraft. The first mission of the series, PTD-1, is slated to launch this month aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on the Transporter-1 mission from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. In another project, NASA is also sending a swarm of three CubeSats, known as V-R3x, to demonstrate autonomous radio networking and navigation. "We have a driving need for small spacecraft propulsion systems," said David Mayer, PTD-1 project manager at NASA’s Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/ames/ptd-1">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/01/27/lidar-sensor-nvidia-drive/">A Sense of Responsibility: Lidar Sensor Makers Build on NVIDIA DRIVE</a></h2>

<p><em>"When it comes to autonomous vehicle sensor innovation, it’s best to keep an open mind — and an open development platform. That’s why NVIDIA DRIVE is the chosen platform on which the majority of these sensors run. In addition to camera sensors, NVIDIA has long recognized that lidar is a crucial component to an autonomous vehicle’s perception stack. By emitting invisible lasers at incredibly fast speeds, lidar sensors can paint a detailed 3D picture from the signals that bounce back instantaneously. These signals create “point clouds” that represent a three-dimensional view of the environment, allowing lidar sensors to provide the visibility, redundancy and diversity that contribute to safe automated and autonomous driving. Most recently, lidar makers Baraja, Hesai, Innoviz, Magna and Ouster have developed their offerings to run on the NVIDIA DRIVE platform to deliver robust performance and flexibility to customers."</em> <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/01/27/lidar-sensor-nvidia-drive/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Quantum computing could impact chemistry, cryptography, and many more fields in game-changing ways. The building blocks of quantum computers are not just zeroes and ones but superpositions of zeroes and ones. These foundational units of quantum computation are known as qubits (short for quantum bits). Combining qubits into complex devices and manipulating them can open the door to solutions that would take lifetimes for even the most powerful classical computers. Despite the unmatched potential computing power of qubits, they have an Achilles’ heel: great instability. Since quantum states are easily disturbed by the environment, researchers must go to extraordinary lengths to protect them."</em> <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/full-stack-ahead-pioneering-quantum-hardware-allows-for-controlling-up-to-thousands-of-qubits-at-cryogenic-temperatures/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Atomically thin, 2D hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is a promising material whose protean ability to undergo phase transformations to strong, super lightweight, chemically stable, oxidation-resistant films makes them ideal for protective coatings, nanotechnology thermal applications, deep-UV light emitters, and much more. The possibilities embodied in different polytypes of h-BN include the ultra-hard diamond phase, a cubic structure (c-BN) with strength and hardness second only to actual carbon diamonds. Key to fabricating such materials is the ability to induce and control the transformation between their various crystalline phases, in a way that is efficient and cost effective enough to allow for economies of scale. While synthesizing such materials in their “bulk” or 3D configurations requires immense pressure and heat, researchers at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering have discovered that h-BN in layered, molecule-thin 2D sheets can phase transition to c-BN at room temperature. In a new study, a team led by Elisa Riedo, Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at NYU Tandon, and in collaboration with Remi Dingreville at the Center for Nanotechnologies at Sandia National Laboratories, produced experiments and simulations using a nanoscopic tip compressing atomically thin, 2D h-BN layers to reveal how these room-temperature phase transitions occur and how to optimize them, partly by varying the number of layers in the h-BN thin film.

Because neutrinos are electrically neutral and interact only weakly with matter, the quest to observe this interaction drove advances in detector technology and has added new information to theories aiming to explain mysteries of the cosmos. “The neutrino is thought to be at the heart of many open questions about the nature of the universe,” said Indiana University physics professor Rex Tayloe. He led the installation, operation and data analysis of a cryogenic liquid argon detector for neutrinos at the Spallation Neutron Source, or SNS, a DOE Office of Science User Facility at ORNL. The study, published in Physical Review Letters, observed that low-energy neutrinos interact with an argon nucleus through the weak nuclear force in a process called coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering, or CEvNS, which is pronounced “sevens.” Like a ping-pong ball bombarding a softball, a neutrino that hits a nucleus transfers only a small amount of energy to the much larger nucleus, which recoils almost imperceptibly in response to the tiny assault. Laying the groundwork for the discovery made with the argon nucleus was a 2017 study published in Science in which COHERENT collaborators used the world’s smallest neutrino detector to provide the first evidence of the CEvNS process as neutrinos interacted with larger and heavier cesium and iodine nuclei."</em> <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/news/compelling-evidence-neutrino-process-opens-physics-possibilities">[...]</a>

<p><em>"3D printers may one day become a permanent fixture of the operating theatre after UNSW scientists showed they could print bone-like structures containing living cells. Scientists from UNSW Sydney have developed a ceramic-based ink that may allow surgeons in the future to 3D-print bone parts complete with living cells that could be used to repair damaged bone tissue. Using a 3D-printer that deploys a special ink made up of calcium phosphate, the scientists developed a new technique, known as ceramic omnidirectional bioprinting in cell-suspensions (COBICS), enabling them to print bone-like structures that harden in a matter of minutes when placed in water. While the idea of 3D-printing bone-mimicking structures is not new, this is the first time such material can be created at room temperature – complete with living cells – and without harsh chemicals or radiation, says Dr Iman Roohani from UNSW’s School of Chemistry. “This is a unique technology that can produce structures that closely mimic bone tissue,” he says. “It could be used in clinical applications where there is a large demand for in situ repair of bone defects such as those caused by trauma, cancer, or where a big chunk of tissue is resected.” Associate Professor Kristopher Kilian who co-developed the breakthrough technology with Dr Roohani says the fact that living cells can be part of the 3D-printed structure, together with its portability, make it a big advance on current state-of-the-art technology."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/health/scientists-use-novel-ink-3d-print-%E2%80%98bone%E2%80%99-living-cells-0">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A material that can be used in technologies such as solar power has been found to self-heal, a new study shows. The findings - from the University of York -  raise the prospect that it may be possible to engineer high-performance self-healing materials which could reduce costs and improve scalability, researchers say. The substance, called antimony selenide (Sb2Se3), is a solar absorber material that can be used for turning light energy into electricity. Re-grow Professor Keith McKenna from the Department of Physics said: “The process by which this semi-conducting material self-heals is rather like how a salamander is able to re-grow limbs when one is severed. Antimony selenide repairs broken bonds created when it is cleaved by forming new ones. “This ability is as unusual in the materials world as it is in the animal kingdom and has important implications for applications of these materials in optoelectronics and photochemistry.” The paper discusses how broken bonds in many other semiconducting materials usually results in poor performance."</em> <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2021/research/solar-material-self-heal/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The new type of neural network could aid decision making in autonomous driving and medical diagnosis. MIT researchers have developed a type of neural network that learns on the job, not just during its training phase. These flexible algorithms, dubbed “liquid” networks, change their underlying equations to continuously adapt to new data inputs. The advance could aid decision making based on data streams that change over time, including those involved in medical diagnosis and autonomous driving. “This is a way forward for the future of robot control, natural language processing, video processing — any form of time series data processing,” says Ramin Hasani, the study’s lead author. “The potential is really significant.” The research will be presented at February’s AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/machine-learning-adapts-0128">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A Texas A&amp;M-led research team developed a system that uses machine learning to improve the flow of traffic at intersections. Traffic lights at intersections are managed by simple computers that assign the right of way to the nonconflicting direction. However, studies looking at travel times in urban areas have shown that delays caused by intersections make up 12-55% of daily commute travel, which could be reduced if the operation of these controllers were more efficient. A team of researchers led by Guni Sharon, professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Texas A&amp;M University, has developed a self-learning system that uses machine learning to improve the coordination of vehicles passing through intersections. The researchers published their findings in the proceedings of the 2020 International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems. Many traffic signals today are equipped with signal controllers that serve as the “brains” of an intersection."</em> <a href="https://today.tamu.edu/2021/01/15/optimizing-traffic-signals-to-reduce-intersection-wait-times/">[...]</a>

Introduction and Acknowledgements It is a vital need at this moment to have frequent and consistently effective sterilization of bacteria and viruses in a variety of facilities and homes. It is also evident that in the scenarios where sterilization of walls and floors is concerned, there are simply not enough manhours available to consistently clean walls and floors by hand at repeated time intervals. This is especially true in hospitals and hospices, where the available staffing is a precious commodity. The use of a robot to complete these tasks is a workable solution to this problem and would be welcome in thousands of workplaces and homes that cannot afford more complete solutions.

Using Serial modules like Xbee or HC-05 can solve this issue but will have less range as compared to the commercial PWM/PPM RF pairs, hence cant be used for applications like drones or UAV. To solve this, we can use NRF24l01+ (PA+LNA) module which theoretically provides a huge range of 1100m (700m+ in ideal conditions) along with Arduino to make a versatile commercial Like Transmitter which can be configured to send almost everything!

<p><em>"Create an inline MIDI recording with an Arduino, an SD card module, and never lose your musical noodling ever again! Creating a MIDI pass-through recorder If you've ever used audio software on the computer, you probably know that MIDI exists: a signalling protocol that allows controllers to control virtual instruments like synths. It's also the protocol used by real audio hardware to talk to each, and you can think of it as the language in which, rathar than communicating a fluctuating voltage signal or series of discrete sample values, devices talk about what is being done on them ("A4 got pressed", "F4 got released", "the mod wheel moved down", etc). As such, there are two ways to record digital instruments (real or virtual): you can record the sound they're making, or you can record the MIDI events that cause them to make those sounds, and that's where things get interesting. There are many, many ways to record audio, from microphones to line monitors to audio interfaces, on dedicated hardware, computers, phones, etc. etc., but there aren't all that many ways to record MIDI events."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/pomax/creating-a-midi-pass-through-recorder-dd89c3">[...]</a>

<p><em>"I've always wanted to automatically detune and retune the strings of a guitar while the guitarist was playing. In this project I tried, and managed, to do exactly that with the help of technician Johan Nördstrom. After completing the project I wrote some music for guitarist Ruben Mattia Santorsa. Attempt 1 The first attempt was on a classical guitar. Johan and me tried to build a system with two linear motors that would move a second, mobile bridge up and down, in fact modifying the length of the strings. It didn't work as planned, since the noise of the motors was overwhelming, killing the feeble sound of the guitar."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/touchmysound/hacking-auto-tuning-guitar-pegs-for-arduino-midi-control-961b8b">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Diceware is a way of generating harder to crack passwords. You roll 5 dice, look up the number in a table and jot down the word you find there, by chaining a string of words together you create a hard to crack password that is easier to remember. The use of a table is time consuming so I thought I would try to create a box where I enter the dice number and it looks the word up for me. The original table runs in at 7775 words but there are now a couple of different word lists available. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has produced a second list with the aim of eliminating the more obscure words, words which sound alike and a variety of other quirks of the original table. The EFF also has 2 lists of short words requiring only 4 dice for each word."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/glennedi/diceware-password-lookup-box-3c20d7">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A Raspberry Pi equipped with 2 FM radios, one plays the station and the other scans the dial and shows the artist and title on each station I've always been a fan of FM radio and, driving around Austin I'm constantly hitting the presets on my car radio to hear the latest tunes. Many stations now use the Radio Data System to show the current song's title and artist on the car radio. I've always wanted a to see a list of what was playing on each station so I built a gadget to do that using a Raspberry Pi and two Silicon Graphics Si4703 FM Receiver chips. One FM receiver connects to the car Aux audio input. The other constantly scans specified FM stations and sends the station's current artist and title to an Android app running on my phone using the phone's wifi hotspot, where I can select that station.

<p><em>"E-Paper Multipurpose Dashboard powered by Li-Po with roughly four months battery life I needed a device that can store the date of a specific event, which I can check later. To be more precise, I needed a device that can store the last date I fed the flowers. The device must be portable and powered by a battery. And because a whole display only for one date is a bit of a waste, I decided to add more features like weather and calendar widgets. The obvious choice for the display was E-Paper, and for the IC initially, I picked esp8266, but after comparing it with esp32, I had to switch it. The esp32 has a feature that is very important for this project - esp_sleep_enable_ext1_wakeup."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/boris-shabanov/epaper-dashboard-c5bbfd">[...]</a>

<p><em>"For quite some time I entertained the thought of having a wall-sized world map. Maybe it started when I read the blog post by Dominik Schwarz about his map, maybe a bit earlier. Exactly as Dominik I soon realized it’s really hard to buy a map which is neither ugly nor has a low resolution/amount of details. There are a few maps I enjoy visually and probably on the top of the list is the bathymetry map of Heezen and Tharp, drawn by Heinrich Berann. While the sea floor depth data itself is accurate and this is meant to be a scientific documentation, the map and its status as an art object benefits a lot from the artists execution. However, the process of getting from information to image involves in this case a manual artistic process."</em> <a href="http://volzo.de/posts/plottermap/">[...]</a>

But unlike a multimeter, the logic meter's probes are for digital signals only (max. 5 volts) and the "measurements" are the sorts of things you'd do to test a microcontroller-based system. The currently implemented measurements are: UART In: connect two of the logic meter's probes to ground and a UART signal, and the logic meter will display the UART data on the screen."</em> <a href="https://github.com/galacticstudios/Logic-Meter">[...]</a>
