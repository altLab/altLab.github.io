<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1776, o físico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Wilhelm_Ritter">Johann Wilhelm Ritter</a>. Ele descobriu a região ultravioleta do espectro (1801) e assim ajudou a alargar a visão do homem para além da região estreita da luz visível para abranger todo o espectro electromagnético desde os raios gama mais curtos até às ondas de rádio mais longas. Após estudar a descoberta da radiação infravermelha pelo Herschel, observou os efeitos da radiação solar sobre os sais de prata e deduziu a existência de radiação fora do espectro visível. Também fez contribuições para a espectroscopia e para o estudo da electricidade.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos uqe nascia, em 1888, o engenheiro electrotécnico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_Williams_Rice">Chester Williams Rice</a>. Ele, juntamente com Edward W. Kellogg, inventou o altifalante de bobinas em movimento.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1917, o escritor inglês de ficção científica <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a>. Co-escreveu o guião do filme de 1968: A Space Odyssey, um dos filmes mais influentes de todos os tempos. Clarke foi um escritor de ficção científica, um ávido popularizador das viagens espaciais, e um futurista de uma habilidade distinta. Ele escreveu muitos livros e muitos ensaios para revistas populares. Em 1961, recebeu o Prémio Kalinga, um prémio da UNESCO para a popularização da ciência. Os seus escritos de ciência e ficção científica de Clarke valeram-lhe o moniker "Profeta da Era Espacial". Os seus escritos de ficção científica, em particular, valeram-lhe uma série de prémios Hugo e Nebula, que juntamente com um grande número de leitores, fizeram dele uma das figuras mais importantes do género. Durante muitos anos Clarke, Robert Heinlein, e Isaac Asimov foram conhecidos como os "Três Grandes" da ficção científica. Clarke foi um defensor das viagens espaciais. Em 1934, ainda adolescente, entrou para o BIS, British Interplanetary Society. Em 1945, propôs um sistema de comunicação por satélite utilizando órbitas geoestacionárias. Foi presidente da British Interplanetary Society de 1946 a 1947 e novamente em 1951-1953.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou e pela primeira vez na história, uma nave espacial tocou o Sol. A Sonda Solar Parker da NASA voou agora através da atmosfera superior do Sol - a coroa - e aí recolheu amostras de partículas e campos magnéticos. O novo marco assinala um passo importante para a Sonda Parker Solar e um salto gigantesco para a ciência solar. Tal como aterrar na Lua permitiu aos cientistas compreender como foi formada, tocar no próprio material de que o Sol é feito ajudará os cientistas a descobrir informações críticas sobre a nossa estrela mais próxima e a sua influência sobre o sistema solar.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker assim como alguns videos interessantes. É apresentada a revista MagPi nº 113 de Dezembro. Aproveito para desejar a todos votos de Boas Festas.</p>

<p><em>"For the first time in history, a spacecraft has touched the Sun. NASA’s Parker Solar Probe has now flown through the Sun’s upper atmosphere – the corona – and sampled particles and magnetic fields there. The new milestone marks one major step for Parker Solar Probe and one giant leap for solar science. Just as landing on the Moon allowed scientists to understand how it was formed, touching the very stuff the Sun is made of will help scientists uncover critical information about our closest star and its influence on the solar system. "Parker Solar Probe “touching the Sun” is a monumental moment for solar science and a truly remarkable feat," said Thomas Zurbuchen, the associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. "Not only does this milestone provide us with deeper insights into our Sun's evolution and its impacts on our solar system, but everything we learn about our own star also teaches us more about stars in the rest of the universe.” As it circles closer to the solar surface, Parker is making new discoveries that other spacecraft were too far away to see, including from within the solar wind – the flow of particles from the Sun that can influence us at Earth."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2021/nasa-enters-the-solar-atmosphere-for-the-first-time-bringing-new-discoveries">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Sony Semiconductor Solutions Corporation (“Sony”) has succeeded in developing the world’s first*1 stacked CMOS image sensor technology with 2-Layer Transistor Pixel. Whereas conventional CMOS image sensors’ photodiodes and pixel transistors occupy the same substrate, Sony’s new technology separates photodiodes and pixel transistors on different substrate layers. This new architecture approximately doubles*2 saturation signal level*3 relative to conventional image sensors, widens dynamic range and reduces noise, thereby substantially improving imaging properties. The new technology’s pixel structure will enable pixels to maintain or improve their existing properties at not only current but also smaller pixel sizes. Sony announced this breakthrough at the IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting that started on Saturday, December 11, 2021. A stacked CMOS image sensor adopts a stacked structure consisting of a pixel chip made up of back-illuminated pixels stacked atop a logic chip where signal processing circuits are formed."</em> <a href="https://www.sony-semicon.co.jp/e/news/2021/2021121601.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"With its recent 17th flight, the Red Planet rotorcraft reaches an airborne milestone the team never considered achievable. Its 18th flight is scheduled for no earlier than today. The 17th flight of NASA’s Ingenuity Mars Helicopter on Dec. 5 pushed the total flight time past the 30-minute mark. The 117-second sortie brought history’s first aircraft to operate from the surface of another world closer to its original airfield, “Wright Brothers Field,” where it will await the arrival of the agency’s Perseverance Mars rover, currently exploring “South Séítah” region of Mars’ Jezero Crater. Along with accumulating 30 minutes and 48 seconds of flight time, the trailblazing helicopter has traveled over the surface a distance of 2.2 miles (3,592 meters), flying as high as 40 feet (12 meters) and as fast as 10 mph (5 meters per second). The rotorcraft’s status after the Dec. 5 flight was previously unconfirmed due to an unexpected cutoff to the in-flight data stream as the helicopter descended toward the surface at the conclusion of its flight."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-reaches-a-total-of-30-minutes-aloft">[...]</a>

Volume shipments start today. The new products are Toshiba’s first-ever four-circuit, 4-Form-A relays. Housed in a newly-developed small S-VSON16T package, they feature a typical mounting area of 12.5mm2, one of the industry’s smallest[1]. By incorporating resistors at the input side, the products are made to be driven by voltage without any need for external resistors. These features help to reduce space requirements on circuit boards, allowing more photorelays to be mounted."</em> <a href="https://toshiba.semicon-storage.com/ap-en/company/news/news-topics/2021/12/isolators-solid-state-relays-20211216-1.html">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.renesas.com/eu/en/about/press-room/renesas-develops-write-technologies-embedded-stt-mram-significantly-reducing-mcus-power-consumption">Renesas Develops Write Technologies for Embedded STT-MRAM Significantly Reducing MCUs Power Consumption in IoT Applications</a></h2>

<p><em>"Renesas Electronics Corporation (TSE:6723), a premier supplier of advanced semiconductor solutions, today announced the development of two technologies that reduce the energy and voltage application time for the write operation of spin-transfer torque magnetic random-access memory (STT-MRAM, hereinafter MRAM). On a 20-megabit (Mbit) test chip with embedded MRAM memory cell array in a 16 nm FinFET logic process, a 72 percent reduction in write energy and a 50 percent reduction in the voltage application time were confirmed. The new technologies are: 1) A self-termination write scheme with slope pulse application, in which the write pulse is automatically and adaptively terminated due to write characteristics of each memory cell; 2) A write sequence to optimize the number of bits, to which write voltage is applied simultaneously. Combined, these technologies make it possible to reduce the power consumption and increase the speed of write operations. Renesas presented these achievements on December 13 at the 2021 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting (IEDM), held between December 11 and 15 in San Francisco. With the accelerated spread of IoT technology in recent years, there has been strong demand for reduced power consumption in microcontroller units (MCUs) used in endpoint devices."</em> <a href="https://www.renesas.com/eu/en/about/press-room/renesas-develops-write-technologies-embedded-stt-mram-significantly-reducing-mcus-power-consumption">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The findings by rover scientists highlight the diversity of samples geologists and future scientists associated with the agency’s Mars Sample Return program will have to study. Scientists with NASA’s Perseverance Mars rover mission have discovered that the bedrock their six-wheeled explorer has been driving on since landing in February likely formed from red-hot magma. The discovery has implications for understanding and accurately dating critical events in the history of Jezero Crater – as well as the rest of the planet. The team has also concluded that rocks in the crater have interacted with water multiple times over the eons and that some contain organic molecules. These and other findings were presented today during a news briefing at the American Geophysical Union fall science meeting in New Orleans. Even before Perseverance touched down on Mars, the mission’s science team had wondered about the origin of the rocks in the area."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-perseverance-mars-rover-makes-surprising-discoveries">[...]</a>

Chief among the benefits of these transition metal dichalcogenides – or TMDs – is that they absorb ultrahigh levels of the sunlight that strikes their surface compared to other solar materials. “Imagine an autonomous drone that powers itself with a solar array atop its wing that is 15 times thinner than a piece of paper,” said Koosha Nassiri Nazif, a doctoral scholar in electrical engineering at Stanford and co-lead author of a study published in the Dec. 9 edition of Nature Communications."</em> <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2021/12/14/new-materials-deliver-ultrathin-solar-panel/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Plastics found in electronic waste (e-waste) are rarely recycled due to their complex composition and hazardous additives, but scientists at NTU Singapore have developed a new use for them – by repurposing them as an alternative to the plastics used in laboratory cell culture containers, such as petri dishes. The team at NTU Singapore–CEA Alliance for Research in Circular Economy (SCARCE) repurposed the e-waste plastics, subjecting them only to sterilisation, before being trialled in lab experiments. The team found that over 95 per cent of the human stem cells seeded on plastics scavenged from discarded computer components remained healthy after a week, a result comparable to cells grown on conventional cell culture plates. These findings, described in a study published online in the scientific journal Science of the Total Environment, indicate a potential new sustainable use for e-waste plastics, which account for about 20 per cent of the 50 million tonnes of e-waste produced worldwide each year. Repurposing them for cell culture in the lab would not only allow maximum value to be recovered from e-waste plastics, but also help to reduce the amount of plastic waste generated from biomedical research, said the NTU research team.

Einstein's field equations describe how matter and energy shape spacetime and how in turn the structure of spacetime moves matter and energy.

When the Department of Energy’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory turned on the world’s first hard X-ray free-electron laser in 2009, it marked the beginning of a new era in science – one where researchers could directly observe the ultrafast motions of atoms in real time and study how those motions affect the properties of materials and fundamental processes in chemistry and biology. But the new machine, called the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS), also required a new breed of detectors that could handle the X-ray laser’s intense radiation and that were fast, stable and flexible enough to support a host of newly developed experiments. That’s when the idea for ePix was born – a new line of exceptionally versatile detectors that would soon become the workhorse for ultrafast X-ray experiments at LCLS. “The choice was to either develop multiple detectors, each designed for a specific experiment, or to come up with a new detector platform that uses standardized components that we could mix and match to build all kinds of detectors with specific functionality,” said Angelo Dragone, SLAC’s program director of Detector R&amp;D and Applied Microelectronics. Today, that building-block approach is the centerpiece of SLAC’s vision for next-generation detectors that can keep pace with ever more demanding experiments at the lab, most notably with an LCLS upgrade that will be 10,000 brighter and will fire 8,000 times faster than its predecessor."</em> <a href="https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/news/2021-12-14-versatile-set-detector-building-blocks-prepares-slac-researchers-challenging-future">[...]</a>

These zinc batteries are made up of electrodes (through which the electrical current leaves or enters the battery) screen-printed on to both sides of a piece of cellulose paper that has been reinforced with hydrogel. Once the battery has been expended, it can be buried in soil, where it breaks down completely within a month. The scientists think their printed battery could be integrated into flexible electronics such as foldable smart phones that are already on the market, or biomedical sensors for health monitoring.

When the Raspberry Pi Zero W was released in 2017 we modified the board with an external antenna connector which was a very popular blog post and with the announcement of the new Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W version we tried to order the new board and try the same modification again. Initially there was very limited stock available and we were not able to order the new board until the end of November. As with the previous version the Raspberry Pi foundation have left a PCB footprint and jumper pads for a U.FL RF connector to use with an external antenna but the new Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W has a solid PCB trance going to the built in antenna compared to the 0201 link used on the previous board.

The tilling (or tessellation) consists of the division of the Euclidean 2D plane with the help of some geometric figures, the condition being that between these figures there is no gap but also no overlapping. There may be regular tessellations, obtained by repeating the same geometric figures but also semi-regular in the case of tessellations with several types of geometric figures. Here the difference between tiling and tessellation can be established. The tiling is done with the same geometric figure but the tessellation is made with several geometric figures. For example, a regular tiling known to nature is the honeycombs of bees, using regular hexagons and a very common tessellation is the combination of triangles and squares found in different floor mosaics."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Tetrakis-Square-Tiling-With-WS2812-LEDs/">[...]</a>

The aim of this work was to realize a circuit that will measure voltage, discharge current, temperature and capacity of the Li-ion batteries, display them on the LCD screen and with software serial connections, using another microcontroller, on a remote computer. In order for the circuit to work independently, it was necessary to provide power to the Arduino Nano microcontroller with battery using a voltage regulator, to provide the required voltage of 5 V. In case the battery is discharged, we provide it with a charger for Li-ion batteries with protection to ensure that the battery will not be overcharged, and with that we have ensured the safety of the assembly itself. For voltage measurement, we used voltage divider with two resistors with a value of 10 kΩ. The Hall sensor is used to measure the current that through the consumer, the DC motor. The LM35 sensor is a temperature sensor that we use to measure the temperature of the battery."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/katarinak998/li-ion-battery-measurement-system-f3236e">[...]</a>

<p><em>"How well, or how differently, do different sensors measure environmental data? A comparison of two units under different conditions. Reliable data for temperature and humidity Environmental data can be very helpful, but for that they should also be reliable. Room temperature and humidity, for example, affect not only our health and well-being, but also the preservation and structure of the building and furniture. That's why thermo-hygrometers are becoming increasingly popular. But if the instrument shows wrong values, then it can be bad not only for health, but also the structure of the building."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/hague/sensor-comparison-temperature-humidity-and-air-pressure-554592">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Collect irrigation level data by thermal imaging, build and train a neural network model, and run the model directly on Wio Terminal. Since global temperatures are expected to rise over the next few decades due to climate change and thus evaporation rates will increase, water scarcity and the expansion of arid regions threaten productive agricultural areas and long-term water availability. Considering water availability is already limited, we need to desist from profligate water utilization in agriculture to sustain our meager water resources. Otherwise, we will encounter more critical predicaments than depleting arable lands due to water scarcity and deficiency. Since there is already an imbalance between the irrigation demand and the available water resources[1], it is crucial to avoid poor irrigation timing and insufficient or extravagant applications of water, which are unfortunately rife in agriculture. To sustain irrigated agriculture and maximize the quality of the product and the estimated crop yield while optimizing the quantity of water used per unit area[2], we need to apply precise irrigation scheduling methods."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/kutluhan-aktar/irrigation-level-assessment-by-thermal-imaging-w-tensorflow-c60b2c">[...]</a>
