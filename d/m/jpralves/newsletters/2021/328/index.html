<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1881, o inventor norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Hugo_Bendix">Vincent Hugo Bendix</a>. Ele desenvolveu sistemas para automóveis e aviões e empresas para os fabricar. O seu primeiro, a efémera Bendix Company de Chicago (1907-9) fabricou um carro chamado Bendix Buggy. Em 1910, inventou a unidade Bendix que tornou possível o auto-arranque eléctrico. Utilizava uma engrenagem para engatar com o motor a baixa velocidade de rotação e depois andar para trás, desengatando-se automaticamente a uma velocidade mais alta. O primeiro sistema de travagem de quatro rodas para automóveis foi a sua criação. Entrou na produção de sistemas de aviação em 1929, com a Bendix Aviation Corporation (mais tarde, passou a chamar-se Bendix Corporation), e iniciou a Bendix Helicopters, Inc. em 1942. Durante a II Guerra Mundial, a Bendix foi a principal fonte da electrónica de aviação dos EUA.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1887, o Físico teórico austríaco <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger">Erwin Schrödinger</a>. Ele partilhou o Prémio Nobel da Física de 1933 com o físico britânico P.A.M. Dirac. Erwin Schrödinger tomou o conceito de Louis de Broglie de partículas atómicas como tendo propriedades semelhantes às ondas, e modificou o anterior modelo Bohr do átomo para acomodar a natureza ondulatória dos electrões. Isto deu um grande contributo para o desenvolvimento da mecânica quântica. Schrödinger percebeu que as possíveis órbitas de um electrão estariam confinadas àquelas em que as suas ondas de matéria se fecham num número exacto de comprimentos de onda. Esta condição, semelhante a uma onda estacionária, seria responsável por apenas certas órbitas serem possíveis, e nenhuma possível entre elas. Isto forneceu uma explicação para linhas discretas no espectro de átomos excitados.</p>

<p>Em 1960, os Estados Unidos lançaram o primeiro satélite de telecomunicações, Echo 1, do Cabo Canaveral, embalado num foguetão Thor-Delta. Na altitude para a baixa órbita terrestre, acima de quase toda a atmosfera terrestre, o satélite foi implantado e insuflado com gás a baixa pressão para formar um balão esférico de 30,5 m de diâmetro feito de Mylar metalizado, com 12,7-μm de espessura. Assim, é conhecido como um satélite balão, como originalmente concebido por William J. O'Sullivan (26 de Janeiro de 1956). A sua órbita era de cerca de 1600 km. Era meramente passivo, para reflectir sinais de micro-ondas entre pontos da Terra, semelhante à forma como a Lua reflecte a luz enquanto o Sol está abaixo do horizonte. O Echo 1 permaneceu em órbita até 24 de Maio de 1968.</p>

<p>Faz hoje <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/40-years-of-the-pc/">40 anos que era lançado o IBM PC</a>, o primeiro computador pessoal. A IBM introduziu o PC por um preço base de $1,600. O PC foi desenvolvido em menos de um ano nas instalações da IBM em Boca Raton, Florida, utilizando componentes existentes off-the-shelf. A IBM-PC estabeleceu o domínio do sistema operativo da Microsoft. O desenho do hardware do PC IBM também se tornou o padrão da indústria para PC compatíveis, com o barramento ISA. A sua velocidade de processador Intel 8080 era de 4,77 MHz, e utilizava desde 16K até 640K de memória. As opções de armazenamento de dados incluíam unidades de disquetes de 5,25", fita, e mais tarde discos rígidos.</p>

<p>Hoje à noite vamos ter o pico da famosa chuva de meteoros das Perseidas que ocorre entre 17 de Julho e 24 de Agosto, entre as 20h e as 23h (Hora Legal) com uma taxa horária prevista de 110 meteoros por hora, se as condições de observação estiverem perfeitas. As Perseidas são a chuva de meteoros mais impressionante e popular do ano, por terem uma alta taxa de meteoros e ocorrerem todos os anos no verão (no hemisfério norte) sob temperaturas agradáveis e noites estreladas. São provocadas pela passagem da Terra pelos fragmentos do cometa 109P / Swift-Tuttle, que foram deixados para trás aquando a sua passagem. A órbita deste cometa tem um período de 133 anos e a última vez que entrou no sistema solar interno foi em 1992. O radiante desta chuva de meteoros, ou seja, o ponto de onde parecem sair os traços das suas estrelas cadentes, está localizado na constelação do Perseu.</p>

<h2><a href="https://oal.ul.pt/as-perseidas-em-2021/">The Perseids in 2021</a></h2>

<p><em>"The famous Perseid meteor shower occurs between July 17 and August 24, 2021, peaking on August 12 between 8:00 pm and 11:00 pm (Legal Time) with a predicted hourly rate of 110 meteors per hour, if the observation conditions are perfect. The Perseids are the most impressive and popular meteor shower of the year, as they have a high meteor rate and occur every year in summer (in the northern hemisphere) under pleasant temperatures and starry nights. They are caused by the passage of the Earth by the fragments of comet 109P / Swift-Tuttle, which were left behind during its passage. The orbit of this comet has a period of 133 years and the last time it entered the inner solar system was in 1992. The radiant of this meteor shower, that is, the point from which the traces of its shooting stars seem to come out, is located in constellation of Perseus. The intensity of the Perseids varies from year to year, in part due to lunar conditions."</em> <a href="https://oal.ul.pt/as-perseidas-em-2021/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Microchip’s new low-density PolarFire® devices consume half the static power of alternatives while providing world’s smallest thermal footprint Edge compute systems need compact programmable devices with low power consumption and a small enough thermal footprint to eliminate fans and other heat mitigation while providing robust compute horsepower. Microchip Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP) has solved this challenge by cutting static power consumption for its mid-bandwidth Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and FPGA System-on-Chip (SoC) devices in half and giving them the smallest thermal footprint and best performance and compute horsepower compared to all alternative devices in their class. “Our new PolarFire FPGAs and FPGA SoCs reduce our customers’ system costs while enabling them to solve difficult thermal management challenges without having to forfeit bandwidth,” said Bruce Weyer, vice president of Microchip’s FPGA business unit. “The award-winning PolarFire FPGA platform already delivered the industry’s best combination of power and performance, and now we have reduced power consumption by up to 50 percent or more with the introduction of lower density offerings, while maintaining best-in-class capabilities on these platforms. No other offering in this class can match these capabilities.” With their ultra-low power consumption, Microchip’s latest low-density PolarFire FPGAs (MPF050T) and PolarFire SoC (MPFS025T) additions exceed the performance/power metrics of any low-density FPGA or SoC FPGA alternatives in the market, with fast FPGA fabric and signal processing capabilities, the most capable transceivers and the industry’s only hardened application class RISC-V® architecture-based processor complex with 2 megabytes (MB) of L2 cache and Low-Power DDR4 (LPDDR4) memory support. Extending the portfolio with a 25K logic elements multi-core RISC-V SoC and a 50K logic elements FPGA opens new application possibilities."</em> <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/about/news-releases/products/mid-range-fpgas-reach-the-next-power-and--performance-milestone-">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Industry First 3.4 MHz I2C Serial EEPROM Closes the Gap in Trade-Offs Between SPI and I2C Protocols I2C and SPI are two of the most widely used serial communication buses for embedded systems and each comes with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. SPI is by nature the faster protocol, but that comes at the expense of higher pricing and limited scalability. To close the trade-off gap between I2C and SPI in Serial EEPROMs, Microchip Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP) has released the first commercially available I2C Serial EEPROM with support for 3.4 Mbit/s data rates, the 24CS512, making it the fastest I2C EEPROM in the world. Until now, I2C Serial EEPROM bus speeds have been limited to 1 MHz, which is sometimes not fast enough, particularly for larger memory size applications. Engineers requiring faster speeds out of their Serial EEPROMs usually choose SPI, which is typically specified for up to 20 MHz speeds. However, they have paid approximately 30 percent higher prices for the added speed while making additional sacrifices in noise susceptibility, design complexity and scalability."</em> <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/about/blog/new-products-and-tools/new-i2c-serial-eeprom-introduces-3-4mhz-high-speed-mode-operation">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3144260/chinese-scientists-develop-glass-hard-diamond">Chinese scientists develop glass as hard as a diamond</a></h2>

<p><em>"Using a diamond to cut glass is not news, but a research team in northern China recently developed the world’s hardest glassy material that can leave a deep scratch on the surface of a diamond with ease. The (tentatively named) AM-III, a transparent, somewhat yellowish material made entirely of carbon, reached 113 gigapascals (GPa) in a Vickers hardness test. In comparison, a natural diamond stone usually scores 50 to 70, with some man-made pieces topping at 100 GPa. Though mass production could be years away, and the price is unlikely to be cheap, a bulletproof window made with the AM-III could be 20 to 100 times tougher than some mainstream products currently in use. The glassy material does not look as attractive as jewellery, but it has some wide applications in the hi-tech industry, the researchers say. The AM-III, for instance, is a semiconductor almost as efficient as silicon."</em> <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3144260/chinese-scientists-develop-glass-hard-diamond">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In a study released Wednesday, NASA researchers used precision-tracking data from the agency’s Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) spacecraft to better understand movements of the potentially hazardous asteroid Bennu through the year 2300, significantly reducing uncertainties related to its future orbit, and improving scientists’ ability to determine the total impact probability and predict orbits of other asteroids. The study, titled “Ephemeris and hazard assessment for near-Earth asteroid (101955) Bennu based on OSIRIS-REx data,” was published in the journal Icarus. “NASA’s Planetary Defense mission is to find and monitor asteroids and comets that can come near Earth and may pose a hazard to our planet,” said Kelly Fast, program manager for the Near-Earth Object Observations Program at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “We carry out this endeavor through continuing astronomical surveys that collect data to discover previously unknown objects and refine our orbital models for them. The OSIRIS-REx mission has provided an extraordinary opportunity to refine and test these models, helping us better predict where Bennu will be when it makes its close approach to Earth more than a century from now.” In 2135, asteroid Bennu will make a close approach with Earth. Although the near-Earth object will not pose a danger to our planet at that time, scientists must understand Bennu’s exact trajectory during that encounter in order to predict how Earth’s gravity will alter the asteroid’s path around the Sun – and affect the hazard of Earth impact."</em> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-spacecraft-provides-insight-into-asteroid-bennu-s-future-orbit">[...]</a>

New modeling work by Rice scientists shows that “cool” stars like the sun share the dynamic surface behaviors that influence their energetic and magnetic environments. This stellar magnetic activity is key to whether a given star hosts planets that could support life. The work by Rice postdoctoral researcher Alison Farrish and astrophysicists David Alexander and Christopher Johns-Krull appears in a published study in The Astrophysical Journal. The research links the rotation of cool stars with the behavior of their surface magnetic flux, which in turn drives the star’s coronal X-ray luminosity, in a way that could help predict how magnetic activity affects any exoplanets in their systems.

<p><em>"The Microfluidics Cluster of the UPV/EHU-University of the Basque Country has created a paramagnetic ring that encapsulates water droplets under a magnetic field A study carried out by the UPV/EHU’s Microfluidics Cluster, published by the prestigious journal Advanced Functional Materials, has presented and characterised the formation and properties of a superparamagnetic ring, which fits snugly around a drop of water due to liquid-liquid interaction, and allows the drops to be physically manipulated. The study is part of the European MAMI project, which involves multidisciplinary groups and companies from six countries. Droplet manipulation is kindling great interest in several fields, including technological applications and basic studies in dynamic systems. The Lab-on-a-chip and microfluidics community is particularly interested in the precise manipulation of small volumes of fluids, droplet microfluidics. A piece of research conducted by the UPV/EHU's Microfluidics Cluster has found that a superparamagnetic ring forms spontaneously around a water droplet when an oil-based ferrofluid is in contact with the droplet under the influence of a magnetic field and varies according to the strength of the magnetic field applied. The ring consists of an oil-based ferrofluid, a stable suspension of ferromagnetic particles in an oil phase."</em> <a href="https://www.ehu.eus/en/web/campusa-magazine/-/small-water-droplets-controlled-by-means-of-a-magnet">[...]</a>

In a new paper published in the journal NPJ Flexible Electronics, engineers from the University of Glasgow’s Bendable Electronics and Sensing Technologies (BEST) group outline how they have streamlined and improved the conventional process for creating flexible large area electronics. Until now, the most advanced flexible electronics have been mainly manufactured by a process called transfer printing, a three-stage stamping process a bit like receiving an ink stamp in a passport when visiting another country. First, a silicon-based semiconductor nanostructure is designed and grown on a surface known as a substrate. In the second stage, the nanostructure is picked up from the substrate by a soft polymeric stamp. In the final stage, the nanostructure is transferred from the stamp to another flexible substrate, ready for use in bendable devices like health monitors, soft robotics, and bendable displays."</em> <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/news/headline_805582_en.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Curtin University researchers have found applying a thin invisible layer of graphene oxide to silicon forms an impermeable barrier, which could be used to protect artwork, prevent corrosion of metals, and produce higher efficiency solar cells. Lead author Dr Nadim Darwish from Curtin’s School of Molecular Life Sciences said while protective layers on silicon were already used as an efficiency enhancer in devices such as solar cells and microchips, the procedure for forming these protective coatings was complicated and required highly specialised fabrication laboratories. “Silicon solar cells often require the application of a layer of alumina, silica or other material to increase their efficiency in transforming sunlight to electricity. Our breakthrough was finding that graphene oxide reacts quickly with silicon without the need for external catalysts, additives or complicated procedures,” Dr Darwish said. “We found the graphene oxide protects silicon from ambient oxygen for at least 30 days, which is a significant step forward in applying the properties of 2D materials such as graphene and graphene oxide to make silicon even more efficient and useful.” Research co-author PhD student Soraya Rahpeima, also from Curtin’s School of Molecular Life Sciences said the new method could potentially enable development of new types of solar cells for more efficient generation and supply of power along with many applications in electronics. “This breakthrough opens a whole new realm of possibilities even beyond silicon research,” Ms Rahpeima said."</em> <a href="https://news.curtin.edu.au/media-releases/invisible-barrier-breakthrough-a-boon-for-electronics-artwork-and-more/">[...]</a>

They may have done it. In a new paper, (link is external)published in the journal Nature Materials, foundry co-director and UCSB materials professor Stephen Wilson, and multiple co-authors, including key collaborators at Princeton University, study a new material developed in the Quantum Foundry as a candidate superconductor — a material in which electrical resistance disappears and magnetic fields are expelled— that could be useful in future quantum computation. A previous paper published by Wilson’s group in the journal Physical Review Letters and featured in Physics magazine described a new material, cesium vanadium antimonide (CsV3Sb5), that exhibits a surprising mixture of characteristics involving a self-organized patterning of charge intertwined with a superconducting state. The discovery was made by Elings Postdoctoral Fellow Brenden R. Ortiz. As it turns out, Wilson said, those characteristics are shared by a number of related materials, including RbV3Sb5 and KV3Sb5, the latter (a mixture of potassium, vanadium and antimony) being the subject of this most recent paper, titled “Discovery of unconventional chiral charge order in kagome superconductor KV3Sb5.” Materials in this group of compounds, Wilson noted, “are predicted to host interesting charge density wave physics [that is, their electrons self-organize into a non-uniform pattern across the metal sites in the compound]."</em> <a href="https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2021/020370/exciting-new-material">[...]</a>

The researchers worked with the University of Minnesota’s Technology Commercialization Office to patent the technology and have already garnered interest from industry. Many metals and their compounds must be made into thin films before they can be used in technological products like electronics, displays, fuel cells, or catalytic applications. “Stubborn” metals, however—which include elements like platinum, iridium, ruthenium, and tungsten, among others—are very difficult to convert into thin films because they require extremely high temperatures (usually more than 2,000 degrees Celsius) to evaporate.

Therefore, CO2 capture and recycling are vital for mitigating detrimental environmental effects and addressing the climate crisis. Recently, researchers from Japan designed a polymer-coated metal catalyst that accelerates CO2 conversion and offers green energy insights. In a study published in ACS Catalysis, researchers from the University of Tsukuba describe porous tin (Sn) catalysts coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and show how this polymer facilitates CO2 transformation into a useful carbon-based fuel. Various polymers can capture CO2 molecules, and Sn catalysts are known to reduce CO2 to other molecules, like formate (HCOO-), which can be reused to power fuel cells.

<p><em>"Metal-halide perovskites are a new class of semiconductor materials for LED display and solar-energy harvesting. However, the best-performing devices are often made from lead (Pb)-based perovskites, whose toxicity may cause potential environmental concerns. To resolve the toxicity problem, an effective method has been the use of tin (Sn) as a partial or full replacement of lead in the perovskite materials. This strategy has been particularly successful for perovskite solar cells. However, tin-based (including tin-lead) perovskite materials are generally very poor light emitters, causing unsatisfactory performance of tin-based perovskite light-emitting devices (LEDs). A reason for this is that a high density of electronic defects can form during the preparation process of tin-based perovskites, as tin (Sn2+) can oxidize and the crystallization process is not well controlled."</em> <a href="https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/2021/0806/c19573a2414183/page.htm">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Step by step how to build an RC Car with Mecanum Wheel. It makes the car can go to any direction by pressing the smartphone's buttons Hello everybody. In this project, I would like to share how to build an RC car using Mecanum Wheel. Mecanum wheel is an omnidirectional wheel that can move to any direction. Mecanum wheel often called as Swedish wheel or Ilon wheel (as the name of the inventor and the company where this wheel is coming from). This wheel is special designed, so the shape has difference compare to the normal wheel."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/lightthedreams/mecanum-wheel-omni-direction-wifi-rc-car-01a883">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Digital Clock with Hour/ Minute/Second Display, Alarm and Hour chime using Arduino Nano and RTC DS3231. Iam a first time user of Arduino, and I actually made this project to learn programming of micro controllers. Though several digital clocks projects are seen online most of them are not having all features like seconds display, hour chime, alarm etc. Also in most of the clock projects the Alarm set time goes off when disconnected from the supply. I have incorporated all these features in my project, and I think its worth to share it with the community. Apart from Arduino Nano and DS 3231 RTC, all the other components were taken from scrap circuit boards."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/ajithbahul/digital-clock-using-arduino-nano-93696e">[...]</a>

<p><em>"An assistive device for visually imparied people, it measures the distance between the user's wrist to obstacles and vibrates proportionally The new version of an open source assistive device for visually imparied people, It measures the distance between the user's wrist and an obstacle and vibrates with intensity proportional to the distance. It is battery powered (there is a small Lipo inside, that you can recharge with a microUSB cable), quite compact, and both the body and the bracelet can be 3D Printed. It can be useful for situations where a white cane is less practical (crowded places, places like inside a tram or metro, ecc). This is a wristband that can help for visually imparied people,. The idea is that you have it on your wrist, and it vibrates when it is pointed to anyobject closer than 4 meters. And it will signal that by vibtrating (thanks to its internal vibrating disc), with a frequency proportional to the distance."</em> <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/181091-tof-wristband-v2">[...]</a>
