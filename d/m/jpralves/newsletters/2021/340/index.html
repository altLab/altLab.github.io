<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1841, o industrial americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Goodrich">Benjamin Goodrich</a>. Ele fundou a B.F. Goodrich Rubber Co. em Akron, Ohio. Após a Guerra Civil, durante a qual serviu como cirurgião do Exército, Goodrich com J.P. Morris adquiriu a Hudson River Rubber Co. por $5.000,00 ao abrigo de um acordo de licença com Charles Goodyear. Esta empresa, tal como a seguinte, falhou em Melrose, NY. Goodrich mudou-se para Akron e iniciou uma parceria, a Goodrich, Tew and Co., em 31 de Dezembro de 1870 e começou a fabricar produtos de borracha como mangueiras de incêndio, cintos industriais e pneus de bicicleta em 19 de Fevereiro de 1871. Após a sua reorganização (1874), a Companhia B.F. Goodrich foi incorporada em 1880.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1929, a indiana <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakuntala_Devi">Shakuntala Devi</a>. Ela ficou conhecida como o computador humano. Desde os seus seis anos que, em publico, fazia demonstrações das suas capacidades de adicionar rapidamente numero até 13 dígitos.  Usando as suas capacidades mentais, ela aplicou atalhos usando algoritmos matemáticos, embora não conseguisse explicar essa capacidade. Os seus cálculos incluíram a utilização de grandes números em multiplicação e divisão de grandes números. Ela também rapidamente deu raízes quadradas e em cubos, e podia nomear o dia da semana para qualquer data do século passado. Exemplos incluem tomar a raiz cúbica de 188.132.517 ou nomear os dias da semana em que o 14º dia de cada mês ocorreu em 1935. A sua habilidade era de cálculo, mas não tinha memória fotográfica para outros factos, e podia ter lapsos de memória como o reconhecimento de pessoas encontradas em anos passados.</p>

<p>Em 1845, Michael Faraday, a trabalhar no seu laboratório no Royal Institution, pendurou um pedaço de vidro pesado entre os postes de um electroíman e observou que o vidro se alinhou através das linhas de força do íman. Fez ainda experiências com muitas outras substâncias, com resultados semelhantes, um fenómeno a que deu o nome de dia-magnetismo. Estas investigações mostraram a Faraday que o magnetismo era inerente à matéria. Isto levou à sua palestra "Thoughts on Ray-vibrations", em Abril de 1846, que expandiu nos anos seguintes na sua teoria de campo do electromagnetismo.</p>

<p>Em 1939, o primeiro automóvel com ar condicionado foi exposto pelo seu fabricante, Packard Motor Co. de Detroit Michigan. A exposição pública no 40º Salão Automóvel em Chicago, Illinois, decorreu entre 4-12 de Novembro. O ar no carro foi arrefecido, desumidificado, filtrado e circulado. O calor foi fornecido para utilização no Inverno. As serpentinas frigoríficas estavam localizadas atrás do assento traseiro numa conduta de ar, com serpentinas de aquecimento num outro compartimento da mesma conduta. A capacidade da unidade era equivalente a 1,5 toneladas de gelo em 24 horas, quando o carro era conduzido a cerca de 100 km/h.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou foi lançada a nova versão da distribuição do sistema Linux, o Fedora 35. Vocacionado para o Desktop, em particular para programadores de software esta versão apresenta como novidades o GNOME 41, que inclui melhorias na gestão de energia, introduz o Connections que é um novo cliente para ligações remotas VNC e RDP. Também os principais pacotes de linguagens de programação foram actualizados incluindo o Python 3.10, o Perl 5.34 e o PHP 8.0.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker assim como alguns videos interessantes.</p>

<p><em>"Today, I’m excited to share the results of the hard work of thousands of Fedora Project contributors: our latest release, Fedora Linux 35, is here! While we broke our six-release streak of on-schedule releases, we felt it was more important to resolve a few outstanding blocking bugs. Fedora believes that software has to be usable to be useful, so while we know that a predictable schedule is important, we also ensure that every release meets our criteria, no matter what the calendar says. A Fedora Linux for every use case Fedora Editions are targeted outputs geared toward specific “showcase” uses on the desktop, in server &amp; cloud environments, and for the Internet of Things. Fedora Workstation focuses on the desktop, and in particular, it’s geared toward software developers who want a “just works” Linux operating system experience. This release features GNOME 41, which builds on the reimagining of desktops in GNOME 40 (which shipped in Fedora Workstation 34)."</em> <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-35/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Engineers can extend battery life by up to 20% in low-power industrial applications with new DC/DC converter from TI Texas Instruments (TI) (Nasdaq: TXN) today introduced a new bidirectional buck/boost converter with an ultra-low quiescent current (IQ) of 60 nA – one-third the IQ of competing boost converters. The TPS61094 buck/boost converter integrates a buck mode for supercapacitor charging while providing ultra-low IQ, enabling engineers to extend battery life by as much as 20% when compared to commonly used hybrid-layer capacitors (HLCs). Supercapacitor charging and discharging helps support peak loads and backup power, which are important for continuous operation in battery-powered industrial applications such as smart meters, smoke detectors and video doorbells, as well as medical applications. For more information, see www.ti.com/tps61094-pr. Engineers designing battery-operated systems frequently face a common design challenge: a need to achieve high efficiency at no- or light-load conditions, in the low milliampere or microampere range. This requires power supplies to regulate their output while maintaining ultra-low supply current in the nanoampere range."</em> <a href="https://news.ti.com/new-buckboost-converter-maintains-industrys-lowest-iq-while-integrating-supercapacitor-charging">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The UPV/EHU-University of the Basque Country is collaborating on a research project, published in Nature and which could open the door to building quantum computers An international research team, led by scientists from the EMPA (Zurich) and the International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory, which has researchers from the UPV/EHU, has succeeded in building chains of quantum magnets made of nanographene that capture the essence of one of the core models of quantum magnetism. The team's results have implications for understanding quantum magnetism on the nanoscale and may open the door to building quantum computers. We are all used to the idea that simple units combine to form more complex structures. So atoms combine to form molecules, which in turn combine to form cells, and cells form tissue, ultimately giving rise to living beings. In the quantum world, this process may take place in reverse in such a way that the interaction between complex particles results in simpler particles. So, under certain circumstances, the interaction between electrons, indivisible particles with electric charge e, gives rise to the emergence of particles with charge e/3."</em> <a href="https://www.ehu.eus/en/web/campusa-magazine/-/exotic-magnetic-states-on-the-nanoscale">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://discover.lanl.gov/news/releases/1101-magnetic-reconnection">3D simulations improve understanding of energetic-particle radiation and help protect space assets</a></h2>

<p><em>"A team of researchers used 3D particle simulations to model the acceleration of ions and electrons in a physical process called magnetic reconnection. The results could contribute to the understanding and forecasting of energetic particles released during magnetic reconnection, which could help protect space assets and advance space exploration. “For the first time ever, we can use 3D simulations from fundamental physics principles to model the production of energetic ions and electrons in those magnetic explosions in space,” said paper author Qile Zhang, of the Nuclear and Particle Physics, Astrophysics and Cosmology group at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The research was published in Physical Review Letters. Magnetic reconnection can cause magnetic explosions, which result in events such as solar flares and geomagnetic storms near Earth; these explosions produce energetic-particle radiation that is harmful to spacecraft and humans. The research team discovered the underlying mechanisms controlling particle acceleration enabled by the 3D kink motions of plasmas – the collection of charged particles ­­­­– and magnetic fields."</em> <a href="https://discover.lanl.gov/news/releases/1101-magnetic-reconnection">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Coral restoration could become easier and quicker with the use of 3D printing. As the technology matures, it could be used to rapidly and reliably create support structures for corals to grow on. Coral reefs around the world are suffering from warming oceans and increasing pollution. Reef restoration efforts employ concrete blocks or metal frames as substrates for coral growth. The resulting restoration is slow because corals deposit their carbonate skeleton at a rate of just millimeters per year. Charlotte Hauser and her team are exploring the use of 3D printing to speed up the process."</em> <a href="https://discovery.kaust.edu.sa/en/article/1183/3d-printing-frames-a-restoration-for-coral">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Ultrastable and made of inexpensive, nontoxic elements, chalcogenide perovskites could find applications in solar cells, lighting, and more. MIT engineers report creating the first high-quality thin films of a new family of semiconductor materials. The feat, which lead researcher Rafael Jaramillo refers to as his “white whale” because of his obsession in pursuing it over the years, has the potential to impact multiple fields of technology if history repeats itself. The ability to create high-quality films of other families of semiconductors led to computers, solar cells, night-vision cameras, and more. When introducing a new material, “the most important scientific breakthroughs are enabled only when we have access to the highest-quality materials available,” says Jaramillo, the Thomas Lord Associate Professor of Materials Science and Engineering at MIT. “Studying materials of low quality often results in false negatives with respect to their scientific interest and technological potential.” The new family of semiconductors, known as chalcogenide perovskites, could have applications in solar cells and lighting, Jaramillo says."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/engineers-report-major-advance-new-family-semiconductor-materials-1103">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The research may aid in developing drugs to fight the negative effects of these microorganisms that adhere to surfaces. Anne S. Meyer, an associate professor of biology at the University of Rochester, and her collaborators at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, recently developed a 3D printing technique to engineer and study biofilms—three-dimensional communities of microorganisms, such as bacteria, that adhere to surfaces. The research provides important information for creating synthetic materials and in developing drugs to fight the negative effects of biofilms. Biofilms can be both harmful and beneficial to humans: they can coat the surfaces of materials and objects, including medical devices, and cause infections, and they are resistant to many drugs and disinfectants. However, biofilms are able to degrade toxic chemicals and environmental pollutants, making them useful in areas such as wastewater treatment. In their latest research, published in the journal ACS Synthetic Biology, Meyer and her colleagues show that engineered biofilms can behave like natural ones."</em> <a href="https://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/engineered-biofilms-3d-printed-499022/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Bacteria which have been shown to degrade and assimilate plastic, has been a key area of international research since 2016. Now a University of Manchester-based team of scientists have made a biotechnological breakthrough which may help humans to call on engineered bacteria cells to reduce our plastic waste. PET plastic has long been a concern due to the sheer volume of plastic created globally and its impact through non-recycled waste on the environment of drinking bottles, take-away containers and micro plastics. Part of the reason plastic is difficult to break down is its chemical structure, which is made up of monomers – small molecules which are bonded together to form polymers. To date there have been many studies on the ability of bacteria to degrade PET plastic down into the constituent monomers. However, there has been limited study on the ability of these bacteria to recognise and uptake the corresponding monomers into their cells."</em> <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/plastic-eating-bacteria-could-help-aid-global-recycling-efforts/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Acoustic manipulation of electron spins could lead to new methods of quantum control Color centers are lattice defects in crystals that can capture one or more additional electrons. The spin of these electrons is very sensitive to external electric and magnetic fields – and to sound. Researchers from the Paul-Drude-Institut für Festkörperelektronik in Berlin, the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR) and the Ioffe Institute in St. Petersburg are reporting now in Science Advances (DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.abj5030) the selective manipulation of electron spins in both their ground and excited states with sound. Their approach opens the path to new methods for processing quantum information inaccessible so far. The captured electrons typically absorb light in the visible spectrum, so that a transparent material becomes colored under the presence of such centers, for instance in diamond. “Color centers are often coming along with certain magnetic properties, making them promising systems for applications in quantum technologies, like quantum memories – the qubits – or quantum sensors."</em> <a href="https://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pNid=99&amp;pOid=64517">[...]</a>

<p><em>"SMART researchers demonstrate a practical way to make indium gallium nitride LEDs with considerably higher indium concentration. Researchers from the Low Energy Electronic Systems (LEES) interdisciplinary research group at the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART), MIT’s research enterprise in Singapore, together with collaborators at MIT, National University of Singapore (NUS), and Nanyang Technological University (NTU), have discovered a new method of generating long-wavelength (red, orange, and yellow) light using intrinsic defects in semiconducting materials, with potential applications as direct light emitters in commercial light sources and displays. This technology would be an improvement on current methods, which use phosphors, for instance, to convert one color of light to another. A type of group-III element nitride-based light-emitting diode (LED), indium gallium nitride (InGaN) LEDs were first fabricated over two decades ago in the 1990s, and have since evolved to become ever-smaller while growing increasingly powerful, efficient, and durable. Today, InGaN LEDs can be found across myriad industrial and consumer use cases, including signals and optical communication and data storage — and are critical in high-demand consumer applications such as solid state lighting, television sets, laptops, mobile devices, and augmented- and virtual-reality solutions. Ever-growing demand for such electronic devices has driven over two decades of research into achieving higher optical output, reliability, longevity, and versatility from semiconductors — leading to the need for LEDs that can emit different colors of light."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/smart-researchers-discover-new-way-generate-light-using-pre-existing-defects-semiconductors-1101">[...]</a>

Thatâs a big reason why optical photonics are being used for photonic integrated circuits (PICs) to greatly increase bandwidth and speed. “Integrated photonics—using light, and photons, instead of traditional electronics and electrons—has enabled chip-scale, compact optical systems with portable weight and low power consumption,” said Sunil Bhave, professor of electrical and computer engineering at The Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. “This has already been translated from tabletop research to commercial products—like chip-scale atomic clocks, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) systems for autonomous vehicles, photonic quantum computing that operates at room temperature, and on-chip spectroscopy for medical diagnosis, among others.” But the integration of on-chip optical gain elements—crucial to the laser’s ability to increase optical power—requires increased optical isolation, to protect the lasers from on-chip reflections, where the light can be reflected back onto the optical source and damage the equipment. In traditional optics, magnetic materials and external bias magnetic fields are used to achieve this optical isolation through the magneto-optical phenomenon known as the Faraday effect, discovered by English scientist Michael Faraday in 1845. “However, the magnetic materials are not compatible with current semiconductor foundry processes—crucial for commercial manufacture at scale—and electrically driven optical isolators are highly desired,” Bhave says."</em> <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE/News/2021/no-more-magnets">[...]</a>

The Prelude Preparing for a student "Fancy Dress" party can be a real challenge. I always struggle with finding an original and fun costume, as the majority of my ideas end up too generic, not achievable with my make-up skills, or most likely both. This Halloween wasn't an exception. But the night of October 30th it dawned on me: I have an Arduino and a ton of LEDs in my electronics box. Thematic Fairy Lights always improve a party costume, and by adding a little sound sensor we can spice this idea up a little."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/tommy_bianco/halloween-shield-4b0948">[...]</a>

<p><em>"As I was getting into the back to school mood this year, I was researching effective study habits and came across a technique called the Pomodoro Technique that caught my attention. The way it works is you work for 25 minutes straight, then take a 5 minute break. Then you set the timer for another 25 minutes and the process repeats. Each cycle of 25 minute work and 5 minute break is called a "pomodoro", and after 4 pomodoros you take a longer, 15-30 minute break (see diagrams in Step 1 for a visual representation). The purpose of the Pomodoro Technique is to prevent you from burning out, and I can confirm that it works effectively. However, when I was first trying the technique it was a hassle to switch between 25 and 5 minute timers on my iPhone."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/The-Pomodoro-Tomato/">[...]</a>

Many animal models and cell lines have served as gold standard tools for biomedical researchers to investigate biological functions in laboratories. Yet, many vital bio-activities such as hormones production rely on fluid dynamics to propagate signalling molecules at the right place and time throughout the body. In investigating such long-range communication mechanisms, a need exist to precisely mimic and control physiological fluid environments in laboratory settings. As a result, many commercial pumping systems are now available: Programmable syringe pump system Peristaltic Pumping system Pressure controller system Yet, commercial solutions come highly expensive and are difficult to customize based on application requirements."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/gabrielstpierre02/programmable-fluidic-pumping-system-58efa4">[...]</a>

This project introduces a digitally controlled 5.1 channel audio preamplifier system. This amplifier is specifically designed to increase the gain of the multi-channel PC sound cards. The main reason for building this amplifier is the limited gain received from the ASUSXonar AE sound card with the Creative Inspire T6300, 5.1 surround speaker system. Before switching to this soundcard, we had a Creative Sound Blaster Z card which provided good audio output with the above-mention speaker system. The key motivation of building this amplifier is to solve these gaining problems."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/dilshan-jayakody/5-1-channel-preamplifier-73569e">[...]</a>
