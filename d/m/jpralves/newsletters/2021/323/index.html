<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1831, o farmacêutico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stith_Pemberton">John Stith Pemberton</a>. Ele ficou conhecido por ter inventado a Coca-Cola em 1885. No início era um tónico, o vinho francês Coca. Mais tarde ele modificou a fórmula retirando o álcool e adicionando outras essências vegetais. O novo xarope destinava-se a ser uma cura segura para as dores de cabeça. A 29 de Maio de 1886, a Coca-Cola foi anunciada pela primeira vez no Diário de Atlanta. Pemberton vendeu mais tarde a receita, equipamento e maquinaria para fabricar a bebida a Asa G. Candler por $1200.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1838, o inventor, engenheiro e fabricante alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_von_Zeppelin">Ferdinand von Zeppelin</a>. Ele foi o pioneiro da aviação que construiu as primeiras aeronaves dirigíveis rígidas, chamadas Zeppelins. Depois de se reformar de uma carreira militar (1890), dedicou dez anos à concepção e construção da sua primeira bem sucedida embarcação ligeiro-ar, a LZ-1. Patenteou a sua ideia a 31 de Agosto de 1895 e formou uma empresa para a construção de dirigíveis em 1898. O seu primeiro dirigível descolou a 2 de Julho de 1900 no Lago Constança, onde tinha sido montado num hangar flutuante de montagem. O seu sucesso estimulou o financiamento por parte da comunidade. Eventualmente, ele produziu mais de 100 zepelins para usos militares na I Guerra Mundial. Durante a guerra, os zepelins foram usados para bombardear a Grã-Bretanha a partir de 19 de Janeiro de 1915 com ataques a Great Yarmouth e King's Lynn. Após a guerra, ele continuou a melhorar o projecto e construiu uma frota de dirigíveis para serviço comercial de passageiros, que incluía voos transatlânticos. O uso de Zeppelin terminou após o desastre do incêndio de 6 de Maio de 1937 em Lakehurst, N.J., E.U.A.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1894, o físico russo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyotr_Kapitsa">Pyotr Kapitsa</a>. Ele partilhou (com Arno Penzias e Robert Woodrow Wilson) o Prémio Nobel da Física de 1978 pelas suas invenções e descobertas básicas sobre campos magnéticos fortes na área da física de baixa temperatura. Ele descobriu que o hélio II (a forma estável de hélio líquido inferior a 2.174 K, ou -270.976 C) não tem quase viscosidade (ou seja, resistência ao fluxo). No final dos anos 40, Kapitza mudou o seu foco, inventando geradores de micro-ondas de alta potência - planotron e nigotron (1950-1955) e descobriu um novo tipo de descarga contínua de plasma de alta pressão com temperaturas de electrões superiores a um milhão de kelvin.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1895, o físico soviético <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Tamm">Igor Tamm</a>. Ele partilhou o Prémio Nobel da Física de 1958 com Pavel A. Cherenkov e Ilya M. Frank pelos seus esforços em explicar a radiação Cherenkov. Tamm foi um físico teórico notável, após pesquisas iniciais em cristalo-óptica, desenvolveu um método para interpretar a interacção das partículas nucleares. Juntamente com I. M. Frank, desenvolveu a interpretação teórica da radiação dos electrões que se movem através da matéria mais rapidamente do que a velocidade da luz (o efeito Cerenkov), e a teoria dos chuveiros em raios cósmicos. Também contribuiu para os métodos de controlo das reacções termo-nucleares.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1904, o matemático francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Cartan">Henri Cartan</a>. Ele fez avanços fundamentais na teoria das funções analíticas, trabalhou na teoria das roldanas, teoria homológica, topologia algébrica e teoria do potencial. Juntamente com outros, tais como Weil e Dieudonné, Henri Cartan escreveu sob o nome de Bourbaki. Eléments de mathématique de Bourbaki contém mais de 30 volumes e pretende apresentar a matemática de modo a ilustrar a estrutura axiomática da matemática moderna.</p>

<p>Faz hoje 10 anos que foi lançado pela ultima vez o vaivém Atlantis. Foi a ultima vez que vaivéns da classe Space Shuttle seria lançada. Este em particular completou 33 voos depois de ter sido lançado pela primeira vez em 1985. Nesta ultima missão foi reabastecer a ISS e trazer algum equipamento danificado. Foi lançado com uma tripulação de quatro astronautas e a missão durou 12 dias e 18 horas, tendo percorrido um total de 8.505.161 km. Foi a missão nº 135 dos Space Shuttles. Esta classe de vaivéns ficou para história devido aos dois desastres com o Challenger e com o Columbia que resultaram na morte de todos os tripulantes. Foram construídos no total 5 Space Shuttles.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou os astronautas chineses a bordo da estação orbital chinesa Tianhe fizeram a primeira caminhada espacial. Estiveram a instalar câmaras e outros equipamentos fazendo uso de um braço robótico com cerca de 15 metros de comprimento. Os astronautas Liu e Tang passaram cerca de sete horas fora da estação orbital.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou, mas em Marte, o helicóptero Ingenuity completa o seu nono voo na superfície de Marte. Este 9º voo não era como os voos que o precederam. Quebrou os recordes de duração de voo e velocidade de cruzeiro, e quase quadruplicou a distância voada entre dois locais. Mas o que realmente distinguiu o voo foi o terreno a que o Ingenuidade teve de negociar durante os seus 2 minutos e 46 segundos no ar - uma área chamada "Séítah" que seria difícil de atravessar com um veículo terrestre como o Perseverance. Este voo foi também explicitamente concebido para ter valor científico, fornecendo a primeira visão de perto dos principais alvos da ciência que o "Rover" não alcançará durante bastante tempo.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker assim como alguns videos interessantes. É apresentado o livro "A Practical Introduction to Python Programming".</p>

<p><em>"For the first time, two astronauts have worked outside of China's space station, completing only the second spacewalk in the history of the country's space program. Liu Boming and Tang Hongbo began the six-hour and 46-minute extravehicular activity (EVA) on Saturday (July 3) at 8:11 p.m. EDT (0011 GMT or 8:11 a.m. Beijing Time on July 4). Liu was first to exit the space station's Tianhe ("Harmony of the Heavens") core module, followed by Tang about three hours later. Wearing upgraded Chinese Feitian spacesuits, the two Shenzhou 12 crewmates outfitted the space station with tools needed to support future activities. Liu, initially working alone, attached a foot restraint and platform to the end of the station's 33-foot-long (10-meter) robotic arm and then mounted the arm himself. Shenzhou 12 commander Nie Haisheng then tested the arm's controls, moving Liu from inside the Tianhe module."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/china-space-station-first-shenzhou-12-spacewalk">[...]</a>

<p><em>"It has been a week of heightened apprehension on the Mars Helicopter team as we prepared a major flight challenge for Ingenuity. We uplinked instructions for the flight, which occurred Monday, July 5 at 2:03 am PT, and waited nervously for results to arrive from Mars later that morning. The mood in the ground control room was jubilant when we learned that Ingenuity was alive and well after completing a journey spanning 2,051 feet (625 meters) of challenging terrain. Flight 9 was not like the flights that came before it. It broke our records for flight duration and cruise speed, and it nearly quadrupled the distance flown between two airfields. But what really set the flight apart was the terrain that Ingenuity had to negotiate during its 2 minutes and 46 seconds in the air – an area called “Séítah” that would be difficult to traverse with a ground vehicle like the Perseverance rover."</em> <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/status/314/flight-9-was-a-nail-biter-but-ingenuity-came-through-with-flying-colors/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"LED driver with four 120mA channels features industry’s lowest input voltage and highest efficiency in a single chip Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (NASDAQ: MXIM) introduces the four-channel, low-voltage MAX25512 automotive LED backlight driver with integrated boost converter. It is the only integrated solution that retains full, constant brightness of in-car displays even during extreme cold crank conditions down to 3V input voltage. The single chip LED driver eliminates an external MOSFET and current sense resistor and integrates I2C communication to lower bill of material cost and reduce board space by 30 percent. The highly integrated LED driver includes four 120mA channels with the industry’s highest efficiency at 2.2MHz operation. Today’s automotive start-stop systems increase fuel economy, but they can challenge the power delivery system to maintain the same level of display brightness during re-start. For example, features like display illumination upon entry can be affected by cold crank situations, with the engine drawing down the car battery enough to cause the display to turn off and back on."</em> <a href="https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/aboutus/newsroom.html/pr_108359114">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Created at NASA’s JPL, the open-source flight software called F Prime isn’t just powering humanity’s first interplanetary helicopter; it’s also powering inspiration at multiple universities. When NASA’s Ingenuity Mars Helicopter hovered above the Red Planet April 19 on its maiden voyage, the moment was hailed as the first instance of powered, controlled flight on another planet. Figuring out how to fly on Mars, where the air is thin but gravity is about a third of that on Earth, took years of work. Along with the challenge of developing a craft that was up to the task, the mission needed software to make the unprecedented flights possible. So they turned to F Prime, a reusable, multi-mission flight software framework designed for CubeSats, small spacecraft, and instruments. The program was initially developed in 2013 by a team led by Tim Canham at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California with the aim of creating a low-cost, portable, pliable software architecture option that would allow components written for one application to be reused easily in other applications and run on a range of processors."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/meet-the-open-source-software-powering-nasas-ingenuity-mars-helicopter">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Elon Musk's Boring Company got a step closer to building another tunnel to transport people in Tesla cars, this time in Florida. On Tuesday evening, Fort Lauderdale approved a proposal from The Boring Company to build tunnels between its downtown and the beach, a route of about three miles. The dual tunnels (one to the coast, the other back) would be called the "Las Olas Loop," named for the city's beach on the Atlantic Ocean. The company's first "Loop" is in Las Vegas. Based on city council documents, The Boring Company proposed the beach tunnel (or "subsurface public transportation system") on June 21.

<h2><a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/antimatter-neutron-0707">New clues to why there’s so little antimatter in the universe</a></h2>

<p><em>"Radioactive molecules are sensitive to subtle nuclear phenomena and might help physicists probe the violation of the most fundamental symmetries of nature. Imagine a dust particle in a storm cloud, and you can get an idea of a neutron’s insignificance compared to the magnitude of the molecule it inhabits. But just as a dust mote might affect a cloud’s track, a neutron can influence the energy of its molecule despite being less than one-millionth its size.

The findings supersede the long-standing result from the Large Electron–Positron Collider. Our understanding of elementary particles — the building blocks of the Universe — and the electromagnetic, weak and strong fundamental forces that act between them, is formulated in the standard model of particle physics. In the theory, electrons, muons and τ leptons represent three varieties (or flavours) of an electrically charged type of elementary particle known as leptons. The standard model assumes that the strength of the couplings between leptons and the particles that mediate the weak force — known as ‘W’ or ‘Z’ electroweak gauge bosons — is independent of the lepton flavour. This long-held principle, known as lepton flavour universality, has recently been challenged by experiments at B-factories and at the LHC."</em> <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/news/lancaster-scientists-part-of-team-to-discover-support-for-disputed-universal-truth-of-particle-physics">[...]</a>

But new research reveals that collisions are not to blame—the sun’s magnetism is. William McDonough, a professor of geology at the University of Maryland, and Takashi Yoshizaki from Tohoku University developed a model showing that the density, mass and iron content of a rocky planet’s core are influenced by its distance from the sun’s magnetic field.

For decades, film also played a big part in particle tracking, with nuclear emulsions, cloud chambers and bubble chambers. The silicon chip, first unveiled to the world in 1961, was to change this picture forever. During the past 40 years, silicon sensors have transformed particle tracking in high-energy physics experiments By the 1970s, new designs of silicon chips were invented that consisted of a 2D array of charge-collection sites or “picture elements” (pixels) below the surface of the silicon."</em> <a href="https://cerncourier.com/a/tracking-the-rise-of-pixel-detectors/">[...]</a>

Qubits are the fundamental building blocks on which quantum computers run and the source of their massive processing power. “This moves the field into a new domain where no one has ever been to thus far,” said Mikhail Lukin, the George Vasmer Leverett Professor of Physics, co-director of the Harvard Quantum Initiative, and one of the senior authors of the study published today in the journal Nature. “We are entering a completely new part of the quantum world.” According to Sepehr Ebadi, a physics student in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and the study’s lead author, it is the combination of system’s unprecedented size and programmability that puts it at the cutting edge of the race for a quantum computer, which harnesses the mysterious properties of matter at extremely small scales to greatly advance processing power. Under the right circumstances, the increase in qubits means the system can store and process exponentially more information than the classical bits on which standard computers run. “The number of quantum states that are possible with only 256 qubits exceeds the number of atoms in the solar system,” Ebadi said, explaining the system’s vast size."</em> <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2021/07/harvard-led-physicists-create-256-qubit-programmable-quantum-simulator/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"For the first time, University of Basel researchers have equipped an ultrathin semiconductor with superconducting contacts. These extremely thin materials with novel electronic and optical properties could pave the way for previously unimagined applications. Combined with superconductors, they are expected to give rise to new quantum phenomena and find use in quantum technology. Whether in smartphones, televisions or building technology, semiconductors play a central role in electronics and therefore in our everyday lives. In contrast to metals, it is possible to adjust their electrical conductivity by applying a voltage and hence to switch the current flow on and off. With a view to future applications in electronics and quantum technology, researchers are focusing on the development of new components that consist of a single layer (monolayer) of a semiconducting material."</em> <a href="https://www.unibas.ch/en/News-Events/News/Uni-Research/Ultrathin-semiconductors-electrically-connected-to-superconductors-for-the-first-time.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Nanomaterials found in consumer and health-care products can pass from the bloodstream to the brain side of a blood-brain barrier model with varying ease depending on their shape – creating potential neurological impacts that could be both positive and negative, a new study reveals. Scientists found that metal-based nanomaterials such as silver and zinc oxide can cross an in vitro model of the ‘blood brain barrier’ (BBB) as both particles and dissolved ions - adversely affecting the health of astrocyte cells, which control neurological responses. But the researchers also believe that their discovery will help to design safer nanomaterials and could open up new ways of targeting hard-to-reach locations when treating brain disease. Publishing its findings today in PNAS, an international team of researchers discovered that the physiochemical properties of metallic nanomaterials influence how effective they are at penetrating the in vitro model of the blood brain barrier and their potential levels of toxicity in the brain. Higher concentration of certain shapes of silver nanomaterials and zinc oxide may impair cell growth and cause increased permeability of the BBB, which can lead to the BBB allowing easier brain access to these compounds. The BBB plays a vital role in brain health by restricting the passage of various chemical substances and foreign molecules into the brain from surrounding blood vessels."</em> <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/latest/2021/07/nanomaterials-blood-brain-barrier-study.aspx">[...]</a>

In this sense, it places a fundamental limit on the learnability of unknown processes,” said Zoe Holmes (CCS-3, Information Sciences), a post-doc at Los Alamos National Laboratory and coauthor of the paper describing the work published today in Physical Review Letters.

<p><em>"Kiriform structures harness buckling for stable, deployable structures Deployable structures — objects that transition from a compact state to an expanded one — are used everywhere from backyards to Mars. But as anyone who has ever struggled to open an uncooperative folding chair knows, transforming two-dimensional forms into three-dimensional structures is sometimes a challenge. Now, researchers from the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) and the Harvard Graduate School of Design have developed a deployable system that is light, compact, inexpensive, easy to manufacture, and, most importantly, easy to deploy. By harnessing the mechanical instabilities in curved beams, the system can transform objects into elaborate and customizable 3D configurations on a range of scales, from large-scale furniture to small medical devices. “Most buckling-induced deployable structures, like folding chairs, are activated by compressive forces that are created through the linear displacement of elements,” said Saurabh Mhatre, a research associate at GSD and first author of the paper. “Our approach is different in that the compression force is generated through a rotational movement, which in turn induces buckling as the trigger for the 2D-to-3D transformation.” The interdisciplinary research team of designers and engineers used a combination of experiments and numerical analyses to understand the geometry of curved, slender beams and what happens when those beams rotate and buckle."</em> <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2021/06/pop-coffee-table-no-assembly-required">[...]</a>

Precision matching of on-chip resistors gives the circuit an excellent CMRR performance. Operating supply range +/-12V to +/-15V. Connection of a stereo balanced line input via 2 x female XLRs to a stereo unbalanced output on RCA connectors."</em> <a href="https://www.electronics-lab.com/project/stereo-balanced-to-unbalanced-audio-converter/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Turn an old "roller ball" mouse into a MIDI controller that can unlock new ways of making digital music. Reimagining MIDI devices based on old electronics I hate throwing away old electronics that still work but are no longer supported by modern appliances. My idea for this project came after finding an old PS/2 port roller ball computer mouse that I no longer had a use for. I'm a musician in my spare time and currently recording an EP with my metal band HELL SHEEP. I'm using MIDI controllers to create synth parts for our tracks on pro tools. Many people use a MIDI keyboard to write MIDI parts on the computer."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/kzra/arduino-midi-mouse-controller-b360eb">[...]</a>

<p><em>"This post describes a simple method of reading resistive and capacitive sensors using a standard PC sound card. Virtually any desktop or laptop could be turned into a simple data acquisition system using this method. Thanks to moderate system requirements, even the very old computers can be repurposed for this application. Socket 478 based platforms from early 2000’s with integrated sound cards are readily available for ~free from recycling bins and are perfectly capable of running the data acquisition software (thankfully, Debian still supports 32-bit platforms). With the total cost of other components under $1, this can hopefully bring affordable and interactive data acquisition to DIYers, experimenters and students in science and physics classes. I do not recommend (in fact, I highly discourage) using this method for anything but educational purposes."</em> <a href="https://nagimov.me/post/measure-with-music-how-to-read-analog-sensors-using-a-pc-sound-card/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/wagiminator/ATtiny13-TinyRemoteXL">TinyRemoteXL - 12-Button IR Remote Control based on ATtiny13A</a></h2>

<p><em>"TinyRemoteXL is a 12-button IR remote control based on an ATtiny13A powered by a CR2032 or LIR2032 coin cell battery. The basic hardware is similar to the 5-button TinyRemote. The main difference is that the ATtiny13 has to query 12 buttons here. There are various options for using a larger number of buttons with just a few pins. However, most of them do not meet the following conditions: there are only four pins available for twelve buttons, a keystroke must trigger an asynchronous interrupt to wake the ATtiny from deep sleep mode, the circuit must not consume any electricity as long as no button is pressed.
