<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1771, o industrial franco-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89leuth%C3%A8re_Ir%C3%A9n%C3%A9e_du_Pont">Éleuthère Irénée du Pont</a>. Ele emigrou após a Revolução Francesa de França para os Estados Unidos em 1800. A partir de 1788, trabalhou para o químico francês Antoine Lavoisier, então chefe dos trabalhos reais em pó, e tornou-se o seu primeiro assistente em 1791. Assim, teve o conhecimento para reconhecer uma oportunidade de fabricar pólvora nos EUA, e em 1803 tinha estabelecido um pequeno moinho em Wilmington, Delaware. Ordens governamentais durante a guerra americana de 1812 fizeram da Du Pont o principal fabricante dos EUA. Desde este início, diversificou com interesses num moinho de lã, uma fábrica de algodão, um curtume e tornou-se director do Banco dos Estados Unidos.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1835, o químico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Wislicenus">Johannes Wislicenus</a>. O seu trabalho pioneiro levou ao reconhecimento da importância da disposição espacial dos átomos dentro de uma molécula. É conhecido pelo seu trabalho sobre os ácidos lácticos, e em particular pelas suas descobertas no estudo do isomerismo geométrico (a existência de fórmulas idênticas com propriedades químicas diferentes) dos compostos orgânicos.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1880, o matemático norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswald_Veblen">Oswald Veblen</a>. Ele deu importantes contribuições na topologia inicial, e na geometria projectiva e diferencial - trabalho que encontrou aplicações na física atómica e na teoria da relatividade. Em 1905, ele provou o teorema da curva do Jordão, que afirma que cada loop não auto-intersectante no plano divide o plano num "interior" e um "exterior". Embora possa parecer óbvio na sua afirmação, é um teorema muito difícil de provar. Durante a II Guerra Mundial, ele esteve envolvido na supervisão do trabalho que produziu o computador digital electrónico pioneiro ENIAC. O seu nome é comemorado pelo Prémio Oswald Veblen da American Mathematical Society. Atribuído de cinco em cinco anos, é o prémio de maior prestígio em reconhecimento da notável investigação em geometria.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1883, o físico austríaco-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Francis_Hess">Victor Francis Hess</a>. Ele partilhou (com Carl D. Anderson dos Estados Unidos) o Prémio Nobel da Física em 1936 pela sua descoberta dos raios cósmicos (radiação de alta energia originada no espaço exterior). Por meio de instrumentos transportados em balões, Hess e outros provaram que a radiação que ioniza a atmosfera é de origem cósmica. Ele observou um ciclo de 27 dias de intensidade de radiação cósmica ao campo magnético do sol e correlacionou-o com o período de 27 dias de rotação do sol. Também trabalhou na concepção de métodos para a detecção de quantidades mínimas de substâncias radioactivas. Hess fez contribuições básicas para uma compreensão da radiação e dos seus efeitos sobre o corpo humano.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1909, o físico nuclear britânico <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Penney,_Baron_Penney">William Penney</a>. Ele liderou o desenvolvimento da bomba atómica na Grã-Bretanha. Penney esteve na Grã-Bretanha como Robert Oppenheimer esteve nos EUA. Foi uma parte proeminente da Missão Britânica em Los Alamos durante a II Guerra Mundial, onde a sua principal missão era estudar os efeitos nocivos da explosão da bomba atómica, mas também se envolveu em estudos de implosão. A combinação de perícia, habilidade analítica, comunicação eficaz, e a capacidade de os traduzir em aplicação prática, fizeram dele um dos cinco membros do "brain trust" de Los Alamos que tomou decisões chave. Ele foi o único britânico a fazer parte do Comité dos Dez Homens Alvo que elaborou a lista de alvos para o bombardeamento atómico do Japão.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1915, o astrónomo e matemático inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hoyle">Fred Hoyle</a>. Ele é mais conhecido como o principal proponente e defensor da teoria do estado estacionário do universo. Esta teoria sustenta que o universo está em expansão e que a matéria está a ser continuamente criada para manter constante a densidade média da matéria no espaço. Tornou-se o astrónomo mais conhecido da Grã-Bretanha em 1950 com as suas palestras sobre A Natureza do Universo, e lembrou-se de cunhar o termo "Big Bang" na última dessas palestras. Embora ao longo do tempo, a crença num universo em "estado estável" como Hoyle tinha proposto foi partilhada por cada vez menos cientistas devido a novas descobertas, Hoyle nunca aceitou a agora mais popular teoria do "Big Bang" para a origem do universo.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1927, o físico americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Lewis_Perl">Martin Perl</a>. Ele recebeu o Prémio Nobel da Física de 1995 por ter descoberto uma partícula subatómica a que deu o nome de tau, um leptão maciço com uma carga negativa. O tau, que encontrou em meados dos anos 70, foi a primeira prova de uma terceira "geração" de partículas fundamentais. É um primo super-pesado do electrão, idêntico em todos os aspectos, excepto que o tau é mais de 3.500 vezes mais pesado que o electrão e sobrevive menos de um trilião de segundo, enquanto que o electrão é estável.</p>

<p>Faz hoje 22 anos que a sonda Cassini da NASA voo perto de Vénus na sua jornada até Saturno. Aproveitando a gravidade de Vénus, a Cassini ganhou impulso suficiente durante o encontro para passar a cintura de asteróides. Depois de Vénus, a Cassini voou pela Terra, pela Lua e por Júpiter antes de chegar a Saturno. Toda a viagem de Vénus a Saturno demorou cerca de cinco anos.</p>

<p>Hoje a Microsoft lançou a nova versão do seu Sistema - o Windows 11. Este novo sistema simplifica o design e a experiência do utilizador para potenciar a sua produtividade e inspirar a sua criatividade. É moderno, fresco, limpo e bonito. Desde o novo botão Start e barra de tarefas até cada som, fonte e ícone, tudo foi feito intencionalmente para o colocar no controlo e trazer uma sensação de calma e facilidade. Foi colocado o botão de Start no centro e tornou-se mais fácil encontrar rapidamente o que precisa. Start utiliza o poder da nuvem e do Microsoft 365 para lhe mostrar os seus ficheiros recentes, independentemente da plataforma ou dispositivo em que os estava a visualizar anteriormente, mesmo que estivesse num dispositivo Android ou iOS. Os requisitos mínimos também foram incrementados relativamente ao Windows 10 e passa ser exigido um processador de 64 bits de pelo menos 1 Ghz, mínimo de 4 GB de memória, 64 GB de disco, sistema de boot UEFI e dispositivo de apresentação de pelo menos 9 polegadas com 1366x768 de resolução minima e compatível com o DirectX 12.</p>

<p>É também hoje que é possível observar a primeira lua cheia deste verão. A lua cheia desta noite é também uma super-lua, que ocorre quando a lua está no seu ponto mais próximo da Terra na sua órbita, também conhecida como perigeu. Por sua vez, a lua parecerá ligeiramente maior e mais brilhante, uma vez que está mais próxima da Terra do que é habitual. A Lua de Morangueiro de Junho é a segunda e última super-lua do ano.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker assim como alguns videos interessantes. É apresentada a revista MagPI Nº107 de Julho.</p>

<p><em>"The first full moon of summer 2021, also known as the Strawberry Moon, rises tonight (June 24), marking the last supermoon of the year. June’s full moon arrives Thursday (June 24) at 2:40 p.m. EDT (1940 GMT). Technically, the moon will officially be full before it appears above the horizon, as the full moon rises in the eastern sky at 8:53 p.m. EDT (0053 Friday GMT). The moon will appear full for about three days, starting early Wednesday (June 23) morning through early Saturday (June 26) morning, according to a statement from NASA. Tonight’s full moon is also a supermoon, which occurs when the moon is at its closest point to Earth in its orbit, also known as perigee. In turn, the moon will look slightly bigger and brighter since it's closer to the Earth than usual."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/full-strawberry-moon-last-supermoon-2021">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Toshiba Electronic Devices &amp; Storage Corporation (“Toshiba”) has developed a new SiC MOSFET device structure that simultaneously achieves higher reliability at high temperatures and lower power loss. In a 3300V chip at 175ºC, a level of current over double that of Toshiba’s present structure, the new structure operates without any loss of reliability, and it also reduces specific on-resistance at room temperature by about 20% for a 3300V chip and 40% for a 1200V chip. Silicon carbide (SiC) is widely seen as the next generation material for power devices, as it delivers higher voltages and lower losses than silicon. While SiC power devices are now mainly utilized in inverters for trains, wider application is on the horizon, including in photovoltaic power systems and the power management systems of industrial equipment. However, the use and market growth of SiC devices have been held back by reliability issues. One problem is the expansion of crystal defects when current flows through the PN diode [4] positioned between a power MOSFET’s source and drain, which increases on-resistance and degrades device reliability."</em> <a href="https://toshiba.semicon-storage.com/ap-en/company/news/news-topics/2021/06/sic-power-devices-20210623-1.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In our future electrified world, the demand for battery storage is projected to be enormous, reaching to upwards of 2 to 10 terawatt-hours (TWh) of annual battery production by 2030, from less than 0.5 TWh today. However, concerns are growing as to whether key raw materials will be adequate to meet this future demand. The lithium-ion battery – the dominant technology for the foreseeable future – has a component made of cobalt and nickel, and those two metals face severe supply constraints on the global market. Now, after several years of research led by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), scientists have made significant progress in developing battery cathodes using a new class of materials that provide batteries with the same if not higher energy density than conventional lithium-ion batteries but can be made of inexpensive and abundant metals. Known as DRX, which stands for disordered rocksalts with excess lithium, this novel family of materials was invented less than 10 years ago and allows cathodes to be made without nickel or cobalt. “The classic lithium-ion battery has served us well, but as we consider future demands for energy storage, its reliance on certain critical minerals exposes us not only to supply-chain risks, but also environmental and social issues,” said Ravi Prasher, Berkeley Lab’s Associate Lab Director for Energy Technologies."</em> <a href="https://photostories.lbl.gov/how-to-make-lithiumion-batteries-invincible">[...]</a>

<p><em>"New research into one of the most volatile periods in Earth’s geological history has narrowed down the precise age of a meteorite impact in the Ukraine around 65 million years ago, ruling out the chance that it contributed to the extinction of the dinosaurs but offering new insight into the planet’s climate history. A team of geologists, led by researchers from the University of Glasgow, applied state-of-the-art dating techniques to samples of melted rock created during the fiery landing of a giant meteorite in Ukraine’s Kivorohad Oblast region. The explosive collision formed a 15-mile-wide basin known as the Boltysh impact crater, which over time filled with water and formed a lake. Previous analysis of samples from the Boltysh crater, undertaken decades ago, suggested that the meteorite may have struck the Earth between two and five thousand years before the Chicxulub meteorite impact in Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula. The Chicxulub impact is widely believed to have caused the mass extinction event which made non-avian dinosaurs extinct, and the climate event which created the geological signature known as the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary. However, questions still remained over whether the Boltysh impact might have occurred close enough in time to have had an effect on both."</em> <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/news/headline_797499_en.html">[...]</a>

The results are reported in the journal Nature. While lithium-ion batteries have undeniable advantages, such as relatively high energy densities and long lifetimes in comparison with other batteries and means of energy storage, they can also overheat or even explode, and are relatively expensive to produce.

<p><em>"One of the most cherished laws of physics - the conservation of charge - has come under fire in “startling” research by physicists. The paper by Dr Jonathan Gratus from Lancaster University and Dr Paul Kinsler and Professor Martin McCall from Imperial College London demonstrates how the laws of physics break down in a black hole or “singularity”. “As the place where “physics breaks down” in a black-hole, we have the sense that anything might happen at a singularity. Although perhaps most useful as a plot device for science fiction stories, should we as concerned physicists nevertheless check what conservation laws might no longer hold?” The physicists investigated the behaviour of charge conservation which is the principle that the total electric charge in an isolated system never changes. To their surprise, they found that they could overturn this “usually sacrosanct principle of standard electromagnetism”. Dr Kinsler said: “By dropping an `axion-bomb' into a temporary singularity, such as an evaporating black hole, we can create or destroy electrical charge.” Axions are a hypothesised particle that are a candidate for dark matter, although their exact properties are still debated, and they have not yet been detected."</em> <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/news/how-physics-breaks-down-in-a-black-hole">[...]</a>

In the last few decades, physicists have found ways to super-cool objects so that their atoms are at a near standstill, or in their “motional ground state.” To date, physicists have wrestled small objects such as clouds of millions of atoms, or nanogram-scale objects, into such pure quantum states. Now for the first time, scientists at MIT and elsewhere have cooled a large, human-scale object to close to its motional ground state. The object isn’t tangible in the sense of being situated at one location, but is the combined motion of four separate objects, each weighing about 40 kilograms."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/motional-ground-state-ligo-0618">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The new carbon-based material could be a basis for lighter, tougher alternatives to Kevlar and steel. A new study by engineers at MIT, Caltech, and ETH Zürich shows that “nanoarchitected” materials — materials designed from precisely patterned nanoscale structures — may be a promising route to lightweight armor, protective coatings, blast shields, and other impact-resistant materials. The researchers have fabricated an ultralight material made from nanometer-scale carbon struts that give the material toughness and mechanical robustness. The team tested the material’s resilience by shooting it with microparticles at supersonic speeds, and found that the material, which is thinner than the width of a human hair, prevented the miniature projectiles from tearing through it. The researchers calculate that compared with steel, Kevlar, aluminum, and other impact-resistant materials of comparable weight, the new material is more efficient at absorbing impacts. “The same amount of mass of our material would be much more efficient at stopping a projectile than the same amount of mass of Kevlar,” says the study’s lead author, Carlos Portela, assistant professor of mechanical engineering at MIT."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/carbon-nanomaterial-light-strong-0624">[...]</a>

For example, when atoms in an optical material such as a perovskite are excited they can individually radiate light, create energy, and fluoresce. Each atom will start moving through these phases randomly, but given the right conditions, they can synchronize in a macroscopic quantum phase transition.

The stresses resulting from these defects – which are small enough to disrupt the atomic building blocks of a crystal – can transform how hot rocks beneath Earth’s crust move and in turn transfer stress back to Earth’s surface, starting the countdown to the next earthquake. The new study, published in Nature Communications, is the first to map out the crystal defects and surrounding force fields in detail. “They’re so tiny that we’ve only been able to observe them with the latest microscopy techniques,” said lead author Dr David Wallis from Cambridge Earth Sciences, “But it’s clear that they can significantly influence how deep rocks move, and even govern when and where the next earthquake will happen”. By understanding how these crystal defects influence rocks in the Earth’s upper mantle, scientists can better interpret measurements of ground motions following earthquakes, which give vital information on where stress is building up - and in turn where future earthquakes may occur. Earthquakes happen when pieces of Earth’s crust suddenly slip past each other along fault lines, releasing stored-up energy which propagates through the Earth and causes it to shake."</em> <a href="https://www.esc.cam.ac.uk/news/rock-crystals-give-clues-to-earthquakes">[...]</a>

Semiconductor device design can be trial and error, though more commonly it is based on a device simulation which then provides the basis for the manufacture of the semiconductor devices for real life applications. When these are new and emerging semiconductor materials, it has often been unknown how accurate and correct these simulations actually are."</em> <a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2021/june/semiconductor-discovery.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Extremely low-density graphene-based aerogel ‘meringue’ can improve passenger comfort and reduce noise up to 80% An incredibly light new material that can reduce aircraft engine noise and improve passenger comfort has been developed at the University of Bath. The graphene oxide-polyvinyl alcohol aerogel weighs just 2.1kg per cubic metre, making it the lightest sound insulation ever manufactured. It could be used as insulation within aircraft engines to reduce noise by up to 16 decibels - reducing the 105-decibel roar of a jet engine taking off to a sound closer to that of a hair-dryer. The aerogel’s meringue-like structure makes it extremely light, meaning it could act as an insulator within aircraft engine nacelles, with almost no increase in overall weight. The material is currently being further optimised by the research team to offer improved heat dissipation, offering benefits to fuel efficiency and safety. Researchers from Bath’s Materials and Structures Centre (MAST) have published a method for manufacturing the materials in the journal Nature Scientific Reports."</em> <a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/announcements/meringue-like-material-could-make-aircraft-as-quiet-as-a-hairdryer/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers from The Australian National University (ANU) have developed new technology that allows people to see clearly in the dark, revolutionising night-vision. The first-of-its-kind thin film, described in a new article published in Advanced Photonics, is ultra-compact and one day could work on standard glasses. The researchers say the new prototype tech, based on nanoscale crystals, could be used for defence, as well as making it safer to drive at night and walking home after dark. The team also say the work of police and security guards - who regularly employ night vision - will be easier and safer, reducing chronic neck injuries from currently bulk night-vision devices. "We have made the invisible visible," lead researcher Dr Rocio Camacho Morales said. "Our technology is able to transform infrared light, normally invisible to the human eye, and turn this into images people can clearly see - even at distance."</em> <a href="https://www.anu.edu.au/news/all-news/let-there-be-light-new-tech-for-night-vision">[...]</a>

The game board is made up of a 3×3 grid of RGB LEDs that light up green or blue to indicate the naughts or crosses. A keypad at the bottom of the shield, that corresponds to the game board positions allows you to input each move. A status LED underneath the gameboard shows you which player’s turn it is and allows you to select one of the three game modes using the start button alongside it. The game has 3 selectable game modes, the first is a turn-by-turn two-player mode that allows you to play against another person, the second is an easy level AI opponent and the third is an expert level AI opponent that is impossible to beat.

The motivation came from the current communication systems in UAVs and UGVs in which a self-contained communication system is a must, and it needs to be lightweight and support multiple protocols. We came up with an answer - take the most popular Brain (the raspberry pi) that every engineer is familiar with, and expand it with the widest possible radio transceiver. CaribouLite is capable of transmitting and receiving in two parallel channels - (1) a wide 30-6000 MHz channel, and (2) a sub-1GHz channel. The immediate bandwidth (2.5MHz with 4 MSPS ADC and DAC) is sufficient for most IoT communication.

<p><em>"DIY (NO PCB) LED matrix glasses using 3mm LEDs! LED Matrix glasses made with discrete 3mm LEDs using their leads as the matrix frame. I started working on this project out of nowhere and a little over 2 days later I had my own LED matrix glasses. It took a whole night to dry the epoxy glue mixed with black fabric color but, if I had some quick black epoxy the project was just a one-night project. If I go back and redo this project I will not use magnet wire for connections 😢 very bad decision! This is one of the projects that I am very proud of because it required a lot of engineering and creativity at the same time."</em> <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/180354-lors-matrix-glasses">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Digital office clock, also displaying interior and exterior temperatures, made with RaspberryPi Zero W and a 16x16 Led Matrix Screen. Ever hated the fact that you have to walk to the thermostat to see if the room temperature is good enough, or that you have to do 5 different swipe gestures on your phone to get to the weather app, just to find out if you need to wear a jacket or only a t-shirt when you want to go outside? This solution unifies these things into one small and fun project, where you get all the data you want at a single glance. Presentation The clock has two views: the "digital clock" and a "temperatures" view where it displays the current interior temperature retrieved by the DHT11 sensor and the weather at the current location parsed from the IP address of the connection (if it exists). If the clock can't parse any of the two temperatures, it will display two dashes as a placeholder. "</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/macovei/office-clock-using-raspberrypi-b2e295">[...]</a>

<p><em>"DC-DC Buck Converter to step down voltages from 55V max to 1.2V-55V We often need to supply our circuits with some specific amount of voltage to our circuits like a 5V DC circuit powering microcontrollers like Arduino. These circuits have a maximum tolerance of 5V. If the voltage level goes beyond that, it can burn out the microcontroller. Thus, a regulated power supply is very important. The main question arises that how can we get regulated 5V or any other power supply. It's not possible many times to arrange the batteries of the exact voltages."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/techmirtz/diy-dc-to-dc-buck-converter-step-down-7097af">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A jumperless breadboard breadWare is a prototyping tool where jumper connections can be made by sending commands from a computer instead of placing physical wires. The onboard ATmega4809 can also read and write any analog (±9V) voltage to anywhere on the breadboard. That means with the right desktop app, you could prototype the circuits with someone else over the internet as if your boards were physically right next to each other. Or save a circuit on your computer and load it up later by just placing the components again. Or a million other things I haven't thought of yet. You also can connect 5 of the GPIO pins so you basically have an Arduino Nano Every hidden inside a breadboard."</em> <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/180394-breadware">[...]</a>

You can turn the game volume down and Discord volume up, when someone joins the call, and turn the Spotify volume up when your beat comes on. Since it sits right beside your keyboard you can quickly change volume, for example if a game has a loud intro music (looking at you Civ 6)."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/DEEJ-a-Physical-Volume-Mixer/">[...]</a>
