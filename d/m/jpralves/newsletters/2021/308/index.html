<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1786, o físico e astrónomo italiano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Battista_Amici">Giovanni Battista Amici</a>. Ele ficou conhecido pela sua invenção das lentes acromáticas. Ele também apresentou a lente Amici-Bertrand, uma lente para a inspecção do plano focal posterior de uma objectiva. O sistema de lentes que ele projectou para um novo tipo de microscópio em 1837 melhorou a ampliação, capaz de até 6.000 vezes. Em 1840, ele introduziu um sistema de imersão para microscópios; a lente inferior foi imersa numa gota de óleo para reduzir e melhorar a clareza. Ele melhorou o desenho de espelhos usados em telescópios reflectores.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1833, o engenheiro britânico <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleeming_Jenkin">Fleeming Jenkin</a>. Ele ficou conhecido pelo seu trabalho no estabelecimento de unidades de medida eléctrica. Depois de ganhar um M.A. (1851), ele trabalhou no 10 anos seguintes em firmas de engenharia especializadas no projecto e fabricação de cabos telegráficos submarinos e equipamentos para instalá-los. Em 1861, o seu amigo William Thomson (mais tarde Lord Kelvin) conseguiu a nomeação de Jenkin como repórter do Comité de Padrões Eléctricos da Associação Britânica para o Avanço da Ciência. Ele ajudou a compilar e publicar relatórios que estabeleceram o Ohm como a unidade absoluta de resistência eléctrica e descreveu métodos para medições precisas de resistência.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1865, o físico francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Weiss">Pierre Weiss</a>. Ele investigou o magnetismo e determinou a unidade magnética de Weiss do momento magnético. O principal trabalho de Weiss foi sobre ferromagnetismo. Hipotetizando um campo magnético molecular agindo em momentos magnéticos atómicos individuais, ele foi capaz de construir descrições matemáticas do comportamento ferromagnético, incluindo uma explicação de fenómenos magnetocalóricos como o ponto de Curie. A sua teoria também conseguiu prever uma descontinuidade no calor específico de uma substância ferromagnética no ponto Curie e sugeriu que a magnetização espontânea poderia ocorrer em tais materiais; o último fenómeno foi descoberto mais tarde para ocorrer em regiões muito pequenas conhecidas como domínios de Weiss.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1923, o astrónomo norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Franklin">Kenneth Franklin</a>. Ele foi co-autor da descoberta de que o planeta gigante Júpiter emite ondas de rádio. O Dr. Bernard F. Burke e Franklin, astrónomos do Carnegie Institution em Washington, estavam a examinar o céu a procura de ondas de rádio de galáxias. Por acaso, eles encontraram um sinal de rádio que lembrava rajadas curtas de estática, semelhante à interferência de um raio em rádios domésticos. Depois de semanas de estudo, a descoberta dos sinais era periódica, quatro minutos antes a cada dia, eles apontavam Júpiter como a fonte. Nunca antes foram detectados sons de rádio de um planeta em nosso sistema solar. Estudos posteriores mostraram que as ondas de rádio eram polarizadas circularmente, portanto, um campo magnético estava envolvido. A descoberta foi anunciada em 6 de Abril de 1955.</p>

<p>E nesta semana que passou um navio de transporte de contentores fechou literalmente o Canal do Suez. Com cerca de 400 metros de comprimento e 59 metros de altura o gigante MV EverGiven de cerca de 220 mil toneladas ficou atravessado no Canal devido a uma tempestade de areia e ventos muito fortes. Este já é considerado o maior desastre mundial de sempre com navios porta-contentores sem a perda do próprio navio. Este incidente já teve efeitos no preço do barril de petróleo e já está a ameaçar algum tipo de stocks que podem vir a esgotar se a situação não se resolver.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou a SpaceX fez mais um lançamento de 60 satélites da Starlink. Aproximadamente nove minutos depois, o primeiro estágio do foguete reutilizável voltou à Terra para seu sexto pouso bem-sucedido. O drone da SpaceX, "Claro que ainda te amo", estava estacionado no Oceano Atlântico, aguardando a captura. O voo de hoje é a quarta missão Starlink deste mês. O lançamento ocorreu no 15º aniversário do primeiro lançamento da SpaceX.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker assim como alguns videos interessantes. São apresentadas as revistas MagPI Magazine nº 104 de Abril e newelectronics de 23 Março.</p>

<p><em>"The Japanese owner of the giant cargo ship that has been blocking Egypt's Suez Canal since Tuesday has apologised for the disruption to global trade. Shoei Kisen Kaisha said it was trying to resolve the situation as soon as possible, but that dislodging the Ever Given was proving extremely difficult. Marine and salvage engineers failed in their latest attempt on Thursday. The 400m-long (1,300ft), 200,000-tonne vessel became wedged across the canal amid high winds and a dust storm. How do you refloat a giant cargo ship? Efforts to shift huge ship from canal Evergreen Marine, the Taiwanese firm that operates the ship, has said salvage experts are working with the captain and the Suez Canal Authority to design a more effective plan for refloating it."</em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-56522178">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched a new batch of 60 Starlink internet satellites into orbit early Wednesday (March 24) and nailed a landing at sea to top off the company's latest successful mission. The veteran Falcon 9 rocket blasted off from Space Launch Complex 40 here at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida at 4:28 a.m. EDT (0828 GMT). Approximately nine minutes later, the reusable rocket's first stage returned to Earth for its sixth successful landing. SpaceX's drone ship "Of Course I Still Love You" was stationed out in the Atlantic Ocean, standing by for the catch. Today's flight is the fourth Starlink mission this month for the Hawthorne, California-based rocket builder. SpaceX is inching closer to filling its initial internet constellation, which is planned to be 1,440 strong."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-starlink-22-satellites-launch-rocket-landing-success">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-develops-industrys-first-hkmg-based-ddr5-memory-ideal-for-bandwidth-intensive-advanced-computing-applications">Samsung Develops Industry’s First HKMG-Based DDR5 Memory; Ideal for Bandwidth-Intensive Advanced Computing Applications</a></h2>

<p><em>"512GB capacity DDR5 module made possible by an 8-layer TSV structure HKMG material reduces power by 13 percent while doubling the speed of DDR4 Samsung Electronics, the world leader in advanced memory technology, today announced that it has expanded its DDR5 DRAM memory portfolio with the industry’s first 512GB DDR5 module based on High-K Metal Gate (HKMG) process technology. Delivering more than twice the performance of DDR4 at up to 7,200 megabits per second (Mbps), the new DDR5 will be capable of orchestrating the most extreme compute-hungry, high-bandwidth workloads in supercomputing, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), as well as data analytics applications. “Samsung is the only semiconductor company with logic and memory capabilities and the expertise to incorporate HKMG cutting-edge logic technology into memory product development,” said Young-Soo Sohn, Vice President of the DRAM Memory Planning/Enabling Group at Samsung Electronics. “By bringing this type of process innovation to DRAM manufacturing, we are able to offer our customers high-performance, yet energy-efficient memory solutions to power the computers needed for medical research, financial markets, autonomous driving, smart cities and beyond.” “As the amount of data to be moved, stored and processed increases exponentially, the transition to DDR5 comes at a critical inflection point for cloud datacenters, networks and edge deployments,” said Carolyn Duran, Vice President and GM of Memory and IO Technology at Intel. “Intel’s engineering teams closely partner with memory leaders like Samsung to deliver fast, power-efficient DDR5 memory that is performance-optimized and compatible with our upcoming Intel Xeon Scalable processors, code-named Sapphire Rapids.” Samsung’s DDR5 will utilize highly advanced HKMG technology that has been traditionally used in logic semiconductors. With continued scaling down of DRAM structures, the insulation layer has thinned, leading to a higher leakage current."</em> <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-develops-industrys-first-hkmg-based-ddr5-memory-ideal-for-bandwidth-intensive-advanced-computing-applications">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news/intel-ai-powered-backpack-helps-visually-impaired-navigate-world/">Intel AI-Powered Backpack Helps Visually Impaired Navigate World</a></h2>

<p><em>"Artificial intelligence (AI) developer Jagadish K. Mahendran and his team designed an AI-powered, voice-activated backpack that can help the visually impaired navigate and perceive the world around them. The backpack helps detect common challenges such as traffic signs, hanging obstacles, crosswalks, moving objects and changing elevations, all while running on a low-power, interactive device. “Last year when I met up with a visually impaired friend, I was struck by the irony that while I have been teaching robots to see, there are many people who cannot see and need help. This motivated me to build the visual assistance system with OpenCV’s Artificial Intelligence Kit with Depth (OAK-D), powered by Intel.” –Jagadish K. Mahendran, Institute for Artificial Intelligence, University of Georgia Why It Matters: The World Health Organization estimates that globally 285 million people are visually impaired. Meanwhile, visual assistance systems for navigation are fairly limited and range from Global Positioning System-based, voice-assisted smartphone apps to camera-enabled smart walking stick solutions. These systems lack the depth perception necessary to facilitate independent navigation."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news/intel-ai-powered-backpack-helps-visually-impaired-navigate-world/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Toshiba Corporation has developed the world’s most efficient electrocatalyst technology*1 for converting carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide, a raw material for fuel and chemicals. The electrocatalyst has an installation area about the size of a C5 envelope, operates at room temperature, and can process up to a ton of CO2 a year. This dramatic improvement in processing speed and conversion rate was achieved with a proprietary technology for stacking CO2 electrocatalyst electrodes. Previous attempts to stack electrolytic cells only slowed the processing speed. Toshiba’s proprietary stacking technology eliminates such lower speeds, and dramatically improves CO2 conversion rate. Since this new approach increases processing speed per unit of area, it can be applied to locations with space limitations."</em> <a href="https://www.toshiba.co.jp/rdc/rd/detail_e/e2103_02.html">[...]</a>

Millimetre wave generation using photonic techniques has so far been limited to the use of near-infrared lasers that are down-converted to the mmWave region. However, such methodologies do not currently benefit from a monolithic architecture and suffer from the high difference in photon energies between the near-infrared and mmWave region, that we called the quantum defect, which can ultimately limit the conversion efficiency.

<p><em>"Scientists from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Ames Laboratory have mapped the dynamics of a catalyst’s active site in three dimensions. This achievement gives researchers new insights into how these catalysts work, and potential paths to improve their selectivity and efficiency. Catalysts are used to speed the rate of chemical reactions and have thousands of applications in petroleum refining, biofuels production, food processing, pharmaceuticals and manufacturing. Humans have used catalysts for thousands of years, far longer than the concept has been understood and studied by science, which is over 200 years. And despite all that history, mysteries remain about exactly how catalysts work, with angstrom-level details missing from the complete picture. A key part of the success of a catalyst is thought to be its ability to change its conformation to mold itself to the incoming reactants, in doing so facilitating their interaction and chemical transformation."</em> <a href="https://www.ameslab.gov/index.php/news/new-nmr-spectroscopy-research-reveals-the-dynamics-of-catalysts-in-3d-space">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Metal-insulator transition (MIT) driven by many-body interactions is an important phenomenon in condensed matter physics. Exotic phases always emerge around the metal-insulator transition points where quantum fluctuations arise from a competition among spin, charge, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom. Two-dimensional (2D) materials are a large class of materials. Their simple structure, low dimensionality, and highly tunable carrier density make them an ideal platform for exploring exotic phases. However, the many-body interactions are normally weak in most 2D materials, hence, the correlation-related phenomena attract little attention in the studies of 2D materials for a long period. Recently, people found that the many-body interactions can be enhanced in 2D hetrostructures or artificially-creased 2D structures."</em> <a href="http://newsen.pku.edu.cn/news_events/news/research/10673.htm">[...]</a>

The discovery of the material graphene, which consists of only one layer of carbon atoms, was the starting signal for a global race: Today, so-called "2D materials" are produced, made of different types of atoms. Atomically thin layers that often have very special material properties not found in conventional, thicker materials. Now another chapter is being added to this field of research: If two such 2D layers are stacked at the right angle, even more new possibilities arise.

But less is known about the fate of carbonates that travel even deeper underground — depths from which no sample has ever been recovered. Now, Michigan State University’s Susannah Dorfman and her team are unearthing an answer with lab tools that mimic these extreme conditions. “What we were interested in is, when is carbon not diamond?” Dorfman said. In a paper recently published in Nature Communications, scientists in Dorfman’s Experimental Mineralogy Lab at MSU redefined the conditions under which carbonates can exist in the Earth’s lower mantle, expanding our understanding of the deep carbon cycle and the Earth’s evolution. “The circulation of carbon and minerals from the surface of the Earth through subduction to the base of the Earth’s mantle has been happening for billions of years,” said Dorfman, assistant professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Science, or EES, in the College of Natural Science and co-author of the paper."</em> <a href="https://natsci.msu.edu/news/reading-between-the-diamonds-msu-scientists-expand-deep-carbon-story/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In a significant advance toward the future redefinition of the international unit of time, the second, a research team led by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has compared three of the world’s leading atomic clocks with record accuracy over both air and optical fiber links. Described in the March 25 issue of Nature, the NIST-led work is the first to compare three clocks based on different atoms, and the first to link the most advanced atomic clocks in different locations over the air. These atomic clock comparisons place the scientific community one step closer to meeting the guidelines for redefinition of the second. “These comparisons are really defining the state of the art for both fiber-based and free-space measurements — they are all close to 10 times more accurate than any clock comparisons using different atoms performed so far,” NIST physicist David Hume said. The new measurements were challenging because the three types of atoms involved “tick” at vastly different frequencies, because all the many network components had to operate with extreme accuracy, and because the wireless link required cutting-edge laser technology and design. The study compared the aluminum-ion clock and ytterbium lattice clock, located in different laboratories at NIST Boulder, with the strontium lattice clock located 1.5 kilometers away at JILA, a joint institute of NIST and the University of Colorado Boulder."</em> <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2021/03/nist-team-compares-3-top-atomic-clocks-record-accuracy-over-both-fiber-and">[...]</a>

At the heart of this global race involving both public laboratories and private multinationals, the quantum computer, envisaged in the early 1980s by Richard Feynman, winner of the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physics, sparked a true revolution. However, amid promises and sensational announcements, it is difficult to know where this technology really stands, and what its actual applications will be. Unlike a classical computer and similar devices such as smartphones, a quantum system does not use binary bits, namely the two values of one and zero. It is based on qubits, which thanks to the unique properties of quantum objects, display an increasing number of different states with the addition of new units.

<p><em>"Researchers at Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden, have developed a novel type of thermometer that can simply and quickly measure temperatures during quantum calculations with extremely high accuracy. The breakthrough provides a benchmarking tool for quantum computing of great value – and opens up for experiments in the exciting field of quantum thermodynamics.​​​ A key component in quantum computers are coaxial cables and waveguides – structures which guide waveforms, and act as the vital connection between the quantum processor, and the classical electronics which control it. Microwave pulses travel along the waveguides to the quantum processor, and are cooled down to extremely low temperatures along the way. The waveguide also attenuates and filters the pulses, enabling the extremely sensitive quantum computer to work with stable quantum states. In order to have maximum control over this mechanism, the researchers need to be sure that these waveguides are not carrying noise due to thermal motion of electrons on top of the pulses that they send. In other words, they have to measure the temperature of the electromagnetic fields at the cold end of the microwave waveguides, the point where the controlling pulses are delivered to the computer’s qubits."</em> <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/mc2/news/Pages/Novel-thermometer-can-accelerate-the-development-of-quantum-computers.aspx">[...]</a>

The high losses compromise their use in optics and photonics. We demonstrated ultra-high-Q resonances in a metasurface (an artificially structured surface) comprised of an array of metal nanoparticles embedded inside a flat glass substrate. These resonances can be used for efficient light manipulating and enhanced light-matter interaction, showing metals are useful in photonics.” “In previous works, researchers attempted to mitigate the adverse effect of losses to access favorable properties of metal nanoparticle arrays,” observed the co-lead author of the study Md Saad Bin-Alam, a uOttawa doctoral student in EECS."</em> <a href="https://media.uottawa.ca/news/light-it-uottawa-researchers-demonstrate-practical-metal-nanostructures">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Using a Raspberry Pi 4, the VLC video player and Node-Red to implement a simple signage type application. The goal of the project was to use a reasonably cheap monitor for picture slide shows and video display at home. The display should be wall mounted (no cables should be seen) and using a wooden frame to conceal all parts. The videos displayed should be able to be changed on demand or run at predefined times during the day. Slideshows should also be possible. Since the user interface should be via a mobile phone, a WiFi network integration is necessary."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/dtv/simple-signage-26f54c">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The Raspberry Pi 400 invokes a sense of nostalgia back to the all-in-one systems of the past, such as those commonly available in the 80's (about 40 years ago!) of having the keyboard and computer all in one, with connections at the back of the enclosure, and expansion at the back of the enclosure. My favorite system released January 1982 was the Commodore 64. So why not have both? With emulation, let the Raspberry Pi 400 become a Commodore 64 as well. One way to do this, is using Vice (the Versatile Commodore emulator)."</em> <a href="https://techwithdave.davevw.com/2021/01/how-to-build-vice-35-x64sc-etc-on.html">[...]</a>

This time I will show you how to make balancing Led dot using WS2812 led strip and MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope module. This module is physically attached to the LED-strip, so when the LED-strip is held at a certain angle, the chip measures the angle of the LED strip and the Arduino uses this information to update the position of a virtual object as if it was a ball that is balanced on a beam and rolls from one side to the other if the beam is held at an angle. The position of the virtual object is indicated on the LED strip as a single LED that is illuminated. The code is taken from the Roel Arits blog with minor changes in hardware and software. Specifically I use Arduino Nano and LED strip with 37 LEDs."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/mircemk/diy-balancing-dot-on-led-strip-ce3101">[...]</a>

In this project, a rain and ice sensor is implemented by analyzing the reflection of an infrared (IR) light source. This project will use proven techniques based on multiple reflections of IR light in the internal walls of the target glass. It will aim to increase the capabilities of standard components by adding technical advantages offered by the LED device, such as increasing the power emission using pulsed energy applied ten times using high current strikes at one percent duty cycle. Below we described steps needed to understand how the solution has been programmed to design a rain sensor. However, if you just want to get the result of programming, download GreenPAK software to view the already completed GreenPAK Design File.Plug the GreenPAK Development Kit to your computer and hit the program to design the solution."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/dialog-semiconductor/ir-windshield-rain-sensor-8c297a">[...]</a>
