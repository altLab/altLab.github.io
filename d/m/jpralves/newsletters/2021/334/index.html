<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1819, o físico francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippolyte_Fizeau">Armand-Hippolyte-Louis Fizeau</a>. Ele foi o primeiro a medir com sucesso a velocidade da luz sem utilizar cálculos astronómicos (1849). Fizeau enviou um feixe estreito de luz entre os dentes da engrenagem nao extremo de uma roda giratória. O feixe deslocou-se então para um espelho a 8 km de distância e voltou para a roda onde, se a rotação fosse suficientemente rápida, um dente bloquearia a luz. Sabendo desta vez da velocidade de rotação da roda, e da distância do espelho, Fizeau mediu directamente a velocidade da luz. Ele também descobriu que a luz viaja mais depressa no ar do que na água, o que confirmou a teoria da onda da luz, e que o movimento de uma estrela afecta a posição das linhas no seu espectro. Com Jean Foucault, ele provou a natureza ondulatória dos raios de calor do Sol, mostrando a sua interferência (1847).</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1861, o engenheiro e industrial alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bosch">Robert Bosch</a>. Ele foi responsável pela invenção da vela de ignição e do magneto para automóveis e cuja empresa produziu uma vasta gama de máquinas de precisão e equipamento eléctrico em fábricas em todo o mundo.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1915, o físico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_Shull">Clifford Shull</a>. Ele partilhou o Prémio Nobel da Física de 1994 com o físico canadiano Bertram N. Brockhouse. Shull recebeu a parte do prémio pelo seu desenvolvimento de técnicas de dispersão de neutrões, especialmente o processo de difracção de neutrões que deu aos cientistas uma nova ferramenta para investigar a estrutura atómica da matéria.</p>

<p>Em 1846, o astrónomo alemão Johann Gottfried Galle descobre o planeta Neptuno no Observatório de Berlim. Neptuno, geralmente o oitavo planeta do sol, foi postulado pelo astrónomo francês Urbain-Jean-Joseph Le Verrier, que calculou a localização aproximada do planeta através do estudo das perturbações induzidas pela gravidade nos movimentos de Urano. A 23 de Setembro de 1846, Le Verrier informou Galle das suas descobertas, e na mesma noite Galle e o seu assistente Heinrich Louis d'Arrest identificaram Neptuno no seu observatório em Berlim. Notando o seu movimento relativo às estrelas de fundo ao longo de 24 horas, confirmou que se tratava de um planeta.</p>

<p>Em 1953 era inventado e registado o WD-40 pela primeira vez no livro de bordo da Rocket Chemical Company. Foi o 40º teste de Deslocamento de Água, e a primeira fórmula bem sucedida, criada por Norm Larsen, para um óleo lubrificante penetrante destinado a deslocar a água para a prevenção da ferrugem. Em 1958, foi embalado em latas e vendido ao mercado consumidor em San Diego, Califórnia, onde a empresa foi fundada em 1953. Foi denominada WD-40, a sua designação original de teste. O nome da empresa Larsen fundada reflecte a sua finalidade original de fornecer materiais utilizados no fabrico de mísseis nucleares, para os quais o WD-40 foi concebido para revestir componentes estruturais e prevenir a corrosão. Após grande sucesso com o seu produto versátil, mas único, o nome da empresa foi mudado em 1969 para WD-40 Company Inc., a empresa WD-40.</p>

<p>Na semana que passou, e após três dias no espaço, a primeira tripulação totalmente civil do SpaceX regressou à Terra, salpicando ao largo da costa da Florida para pôr fim a uma missão histórica. "Tem sido uma viagem incrível para todos", disse o director da missão Inspiration4, Kip O'Keefe, numa conferência de imprensa pós-splashdown. "Não podíamos pedir uma missão mais bem sucedida". O SpaceX Crew Dragon Resilience aterrou suavemente no Oceano Atlântico ao largo da costa do Cabo Canaveral, Florida, a 18 de Setembro às 19h06 EDT (2306 GMT) marcando o fim da missão Inspiration4, um voo espacial privado que lançou quatro civis em órbita no início desta semana.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker assim como alguns videos interessantes. É apresentado o livro "The Official Raspberry Pi Handbook 2022".</p>

<p><em>"After three days in space, SpaceX's first all-civilian crew returned to Earth tonight, splashing down off the Florida coast to end a historic mission. "It's been an amazing ride for everyone," Inspiration4 mission director Kip O'Keefe said in a post-splashdown news conference. "We couldn't ask for a more successful mission." The SpaceX Crew Dragon Resilience gently landed in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Cape Canaveral, Florida tonight (Sept. 18) at 7:06 p.m. EDT (2306 GMT) marking the end of the Inspiration4 mission, a private spaceflight that launched four civilians into orbit earlier this week. The flight was part of a massive fundraising effort for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Jared Isaacman, billionaire and four of Shift4 Payments, purchased the flight from SpaceX in order to raise $200 million for childhood cancer research."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-inspiration4-returns-to-earth">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The world’s first battery-electric freight train was unveiled at an event in Pittsburgh on Friday, amid a fresh attempt by some US lawmakers to slash carbon emissions from rail transport in order to address the climate crisis. Wabtec, the Pittsburgh-based rail freight company, showed off its locomotive at Carnegie Mellon University as part of a new venture between the two organizations to develop zero emissions technology to help move the 1.7bn tons of goods that are shipped on American railroads each year. Perched upon a strip of rail at Carnegie Mellon’s technology campus on the banks of the Monongahela River, the cherry red, 75ft-long train provided a striking background to politicians, rail executives and academics who urged a swifter industry transition away from fossil fuels. Dignitaries were allowed to clamber up a vertiginous ladder on to the train to inspect its confines, which included a small driver’s cabin in front of 500 lithium-ion battery modules, arrayed in stacks in the heart of the vehicle. The new train, known as the FLXdrive battery-electric locomotive, underwent successful trials in California earlier this year where it was found to have cut fuel consumption by 11%, which meant reducing the amount of diesel used by 6,200 gallons. Wabtec said that the next iteration of the locomotive, to be rolled out within two years, will be able to cut the consumption of diesel, the fossil fuel traditionally used in freight rail, by nearly a third."</em> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/16/battery-electric-freight-train-wabtec-rail-transport-emissions">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Engineers at Lancaster University have led research that discovers a way to generate renewable biofuel additives, using radiation that could be derived from nuclear waste. The renewable proportion of petrol is set to increase to 20 per cent over the coming years, meaning the discovery of a new production pathway for these additives could help in the fight to cut carbon dioxide emissions and tackle climate change. In the research paper entitled ‘Nuclear-driven production of renewable fuel additives from waste organics’, published in the science journal Nature Communications Chemistry, engineers propose a process to generate one such additive, solketal, using waste from both biochemical and nuclear industries – termed a nuclear biorefinery. Lancaster University PhD researcher Arran Plant said: “This research presents a new advance that utilises radiation that could, in the future, be derived from nuclear waste to produce renewable biofuel additives from biodiesel waste, which could then be used in modern petroleum fuel blends. With the renewable proportions of petroleum-derived fuels set to increase from 5 per cent to 20 per cent by 2030, fuel additives sourced this way could help address net-zero carbon emission targets.” Malcolm Joyce, Professor of Nuclear Engineering at Lancaster University, said: “Co-generation with nuclear energy is an important area of current research, for example, using heat alongside the production of electricity. We set out to determine whether radiation might also present a similar possibility, and discovered that it can: in this case yielding a low-carbon fuel additive.” Dr Vesna Najdanovic, an expert in biofuels from Aston University, and previously at Lancaster University, said: “I am so excited about our work as it reveals a new method for processing wastes from biodiesel industry using spent nuclear energy."</em> <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/news/engineers-discover-way-to-turn-organic-waste-into-renewable-biofuel-additives-using-radiation">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Last year, computer engineers from Northwestern University and Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) introduced the world’s first battery-free Game Boy, which harvests both solar energy and the user’s kinetic energy from button mashing to power an unlimited lifetime of game play. The same team now introduces a new platform that enables makers, hobbyists and novice programmers to build their own battery-free electronic devices that run with intermittent, harvested energy. Called BFree, the system includes energy-harvesting hardware (the BFree Shield) and a power-failure-resistant version of Python, one of the most accessible and most used programming languages. All the user needs is a basic understanding of Python in order to quickly and easily turn any do-it-yourself (DIY) smart device into a battery-free version. With this technology, novice programmers can now turn their DIY battery-powered motion sensor, for example, into a solar-powered sensor with an infinite lifetime. The research will be presented virtually at 11 a.m. EDT (U.S.) on Wednesday, Sept. 22, at UbiComp 2021, the premier conference for ubiquitous computing."</em> <a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2021/september/now-everyone-can-build-battery-free-electronic-devices/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A research team that includes two UO physicists have outlined new techniques for controlling the building blocks of quantum computing, a potentially significant step toward making such computers more accurate and useful. Physicists David Allcock and David Wineland are founders of the new Oregon Ions Laboratory, which was recently set up in the basement of Willamette Hall. They are among 12 authors of a new paper, which is based on an experiment at the National Institute for Standards and Technology in Boulder, Colorado. Both scientists previously worked at the Colorado lab and continued to collaborate on the project after coming to the UO in 2018. The techniques, described in the journal Nature, involve the use of trapped-ion quantum bits, or qubits, in quantum computing and simulations. They could lead to improvements in the operation of quantum computers, which still make too many computation errors to be effective tools, the physicists said."</em> <a href="https://around.uoregon.edu/content/uo-physicists-colleagues-offer-new-way-control-qubits">[...]</a>

And now, by turning the rotary encoder, I can access a clock and calendar, a thermometer and barometer, a tide clock, a timer and so on... By pushing the rotary encoder, I can adjust many parameters: the temperature unit (°C, °F or °K), the pressure unit (mmHg or hPa), the altitude which is used to calculate the pressure at sea level, the brightness of the LCD...
