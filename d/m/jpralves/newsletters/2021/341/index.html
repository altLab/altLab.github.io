<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1904, o matemático britânico <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._H._C._Whitehead">J. H. C. Whitehead</a>. Ele influenciou grandemente o desenvolvimento da teoria da homotopia (um tipo especial de mapeamento de espaços topológicos). O trabalho de Whitehead em geometria diferencial culminou no artigo "On the Covering of a Complete Space by the Geodesics Through a Point" (1935), contendo contribuições pioneiras para esta área da matemática. Manteve sempre o seu interesse pela geometria, mas logo se concentrou na topologia. Fez contribuições substanciais para a homotopia combinatória e colectores Stiefel e fundou uma escola de topologia em Oxford.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou um lançamento da SpaceX marca o lançamento de 600 viajantes espaciais em 60 anos. Na passada quarta-feira, um foguetão da SpaceX transportou quatro astronautas em órbita. O voo repetidamente atrasado ocorreu apenas dois dias depois da SpaceX ter trazido quatro outros astronautas da Estação Espacial Internacional para casa. Eles deveriam ter lá estado para dar as boas-vindas aos recém-chegados, mas a NASA e a SpaceX decidiram mudar a ordem com base no tempo ideal de recuperação de segunda-feira no Golfo do México, e conseguiram-no.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker assim como alguns videos interessantes.</p>

<p><em>"A SpaceX rocket carried four astronauts into orbit Wednesday night, including the 600th person to reach space in 60 years. The repeatedly delayed flight occurred just two days after SpaceX brought four other astronauts home from the International Space Station. They should have been up there to welcome the newcomers, but NASA and SpaceX decided to switch the order based on Monday’s ideal recovery weather in the Gulf of Mexico and pulled it off. “It was a great ride, better than we imagined," mission commander Raja Chari said shortly after the spacecraft reached orbit. The launch was just as riveting for spectators at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, as well as along the East Coast, as the Falcon rocket thundered through clouds on its way to space, turning night into day. Germany’s Matthias Maurer claimed the No."</em> <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/spacex-aims-night-crew-launch-ailing-astronaut-now-81093068">[...]</a>

Transmitted by an antenna in the doughnut-shaped vacuum chamber common to magnetic confinement fusion devices called tokamaks, RF waves heat the plasma fuel and drive its current around the toroidal interior. The efficiency of this process can be affected by how the wave’s trajectory is altered (or “scattered”) by conditions within the chamber.

We all use it continuously in our everyday life: for example in our mobile phone there are at least a dozen MEMS that regulate different activities ranging from motion, position and inclination monitoring of the phone, active filters for the different transmission bands and the microphone itself. Even more interesting is the extreme nanoscale miniaturization of these devices (NEMS), because it offers the possibility of creating inertial, mass and force sensors with such sensitivity that they can interact with single molecules. However, the diffusion of NEMS sensors is still limited by the high manufacturing cost of traditional silicon-based technologies. Conversely, new technologies such as 3D printing have shown that similar structures can be created at low cost and with interesting intrinsic functionalities, but to date the performance as mass sensors are poor. The article "Reaching silicon-based NEMS performances with 3D printer nanomechanical resonators" published in the prestigious journal Nature Communications shows how it is possible to obtain mechanical nanoresonators from 3D printing with figures of merit such as quality factor, published stability, mass sensitivity and strength comparable to those of silicon resonators."</em> <a href="https://poliflash.polito.it/en/research_innovation/3d_printing_nanoresonators_towards_miniaturized_and_multifunctional_sensors">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers resolve a long-standing challenge in quantum optics: optimal Bell-state measurement of time-bin encoded qubits, to enhance the key rate of secure quantum communication Integrated quantum photonics (IQP) is a promising platform for realizing scalable and practical quantum information processing. Up to now, most of the demonstrations with IQP focus on improving the stability, quality, and complexity of experiments for traditional platforms based on bulk and fiber optical elements. A more demanding question is: "Are there experiments possible with IQP that are impossible with traditional technology?" This question is answered affirmatively by a team led jointly by Xiao-Song Ma and Labao Zhang from Nanjing University, and Xinlun Cai from Sun Yat-sen University, China. As reported in Advanced Photonics, the team realizes quantum communication using a chip based on silicon photonics with a superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD). The excellent performance of this chip allows them to realize optimal time-bin Bell state measurement and to significantly enhance the key rate in quantum communication."</em> <a href="https://spie.org/news/a-superconducting-silicon-photonic-chip-for-quantum-communication?SSO=1">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Researchers from the University of Surrey’s Advanced Technology Institute (ATI) and the University of São Paulo have developed a new analysis technique that will help scientists improve renewable energy storage by making better supercapacitors. The team’s new approach enables researchers to investigate the complex inter-connected behaviour of supercapacitor electrodes made from layers of different materials. Improvements in energy storage are vital if countries are to deliver carbon reduction targets. The inherent unpredictability of energy from solar and wind means effective storage is required to ensure consistency in supply, and supercapacitors are seen as an important part of the solution. Supercapacitors could also be the answer to charging electric vehicles much faster than is possible using lithium-ion batteries. However, more supercapacitor development is needed to enable them to effectively store enough electricity."</em> <a href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk/news/surrey-researchers-reveal-hidden-behaviour-supercapacitor-materials">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Princeton researchers have created the world's purest sample of gallium arsenide, a semiconductor used in devices that power such technologies as cell phones and satellites. The team baked their material down to one impurity for every 10 billion atoms, reaching a level of quality that outstrips even the world's purest silicon sample used in verifying the one-kilogram standard. The finished gallium arsenide chip, a square about the width of a pencil eraser, allowed the team to probe deep into the very nature of electrons. Rather than sending this chip to space, the researchers took their ultra-pure sample to the basement of Princeton's engineering quadrangle where they wired it up, froze it to colder-than-space temperatures, enveloped it in a powerful magnetic field and applied a voltage, sending electrons through the two-dimensional plane sandwiched between the material's crystalline layers. As they lowered the magnetic field, they found a surprising series of effects. The results, published(link is external) in Nature Materials, showed that many of the phenomena driving today's most advanced physics can be observed under far weaker magnetic fields than previously thought."</em> <a href="https://ece.princeton.edu/news/ultra-pure-semiconductor-opens-new-frontier-study-electrons">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Move over, Hollywood — science fiction is getting ready to leap off the big screen and enter the real world. While recent science fiction movies have demonstrated the power of artificially intelligent computer programs, such as the fictional character J.A.R.V.I.S. in the Avenger film series, to make independent decisions to carry out a set of actions, these imagined movie scenarios could now be closer to becoming a reality. In a recent study published in Nature Communications, a journal of Nature, researchers at the University of Missouri and University of Chicago have developed an artificial material, called a metamaterial, which can respond to its environment, independently make a decision, and perform an action not directed by a human being. For example, a drone making a delivery might evaluate its environment including wind direction, speed or wildlife, and automatically change course in order to complete the delivery safely.
