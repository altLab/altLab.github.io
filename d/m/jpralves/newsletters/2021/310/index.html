<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1732, o astrónomo e matemático norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Rittenhouse">David Rittenhouse</a>. Ele foi um dos primeiros observadores da atmosfera de Vénus. Para observações do trânsito de Vénus em 3 de Junho de 1769, ele construiu um relógio de pêndulo de alta precisão, um quadrante astronómico, um instrumento de igual altitude e um trânsito astronómico. Ele foi o primeiro na América a colocar teias de aranha como mira no foco de seu telescópio. Ele geralmente é creditado com a invenção da bússola vernier e, possivelmente, o levantador automático de agulha. Ele foi professor de astronomia na Universidade da Pensilvânia. Para Thomas Jefferson, ele padronizou as medidas do pé por pêndulo num projecto para estabelecer um sistema decimal de pesos e medidas.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1779, o Físico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Schweigger">Johann Schweigger</a>. Ele inventou o galvanometro em 1820, um dispositivo para medir a força de uma corrente eléctrica. Ele desenvolveu o princípio a partir da experiência de Oersted (1819), que mostrou que a corrente num fio desvia a agulha de uma bússola. Schweigger percebeu que sugeria um instrumento de medição básico, já que uma corrente mais forte produziria uma deflexão maior, e ele aumentou o efeito enrolando o fio várias vezes numa bobine à volta da agulha magnética. Ele chamou a este instrumento de “galvanometro” em homenagem a Luigi Galvani, o professor que deu a Volta a ideia da primeira bateria. Thomas Seebeck (1770-1831) chamou a bobine inovadora de multiplicador de Schweigger. Tornou-se a base dos instrumentos de bobine em movimento e alto-falantes.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1811, o metalúrgico inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Forester_Mushet">Robert Forester Mushet</a>. Ele foi responsável pelo desenvolvimento de um método de fabricação de aço pela adição de manganês, que melhorou o processo Bessemer. Ele foi o primeiro a fazer carris duráveis de aço (substituindo o ferro fundido), o que foi importante para o desenvolvimento das ferro-vias em todo o mundo. Mushet inventou o aço de tungsténio em 1868, que produzia um aço para ferramentas mais resistente, capaz de cortar e maquinar metais mais duros em velocidades mais rápidas. Apesar da sua importância, que fez fortuna para outros (incluindo Bessemer), Mushet não capitalizou com sucesso suas descobertas.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1818, o químico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Wilhelm_von_Hofmann">August Wilhelm von Hofmann</a>. Ele, com as pesquisas sobre anilina, com a de seu ex-aluno Sir William Henry Perkin, ajudaram a estabelecer as bases da indústria de corantes de anilina. Ele foi o primeiro a preparar a rosanilina e seus derivados e pesquisou muitos outros compostos, incluindo a descoberta do formaldeído. No campo da química orgânica, Hofmann é mais conhecido por seus estudos dos derivados orgânicos da amónia e da fosfina e por sua subsequente descoberta da reacção de degradação de Hofmann. Ele também desenvolveu o método de Hofmann para encontrar as densidades de vapor e, a partir delas, os pesos moleculares dos líquidos. Ele também ajudou a popularizar o conceito de valência (a palavra vem de seu termo quantivalência).</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1911,o bioquímico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvin_Calvin">Melvin Calvin</a>. Ele recebeu o Prémio Nobel de Química em 1961 por promover nosso conhecimento do mecanismo da fotossíntese. No Ciclo de Calvin, ele descreveu as “reacções escuras” da fotossíntese que ocorrem nas plantas verdes durante a noite, transformando dióxido de carbono em açúcar. Usando o isótopo de carbono-14 como traçador de dióxido de carbono, Calvin e sua equipa identificaram a rota completa conforme o átomo de carbono viaja por uma planta durante a fotossíntese, desde a absorção do dióxido de carbono atmosférico até à sua incorporação em carbo-hidratos e outros compostos orgânicos. Com o seu grupo, Calvin mostrou que a luz do sol actua sobre as moléculas de clorofila de uma planta, e não sobre o dióxido de carbono (como se acreditava anteriormente).</p>

<p>Faz hoje precisamente 5 anos que a SpaceX fez com sucesso o primeiro pouso de retorno suave de um foguetão booster Falcon 9 reutilizável num navio drone no mar. A SpaceX, uma empresa privada de voos espaciais, realizou assim uma façanha nunca antes realizada por ninguém. Foi o primeiro estágio do foguete Falcon 9 que também lançou com sucesso uma cápsula de carga para a Estação Espacial Internacional. Depois de içar o segundo estágio (que continuou no espaço), o estágio de reforço foi projectado para se separar e retornar intacto para ser usado novamente. Ele disparou propulsores para reduzir a velocidade e para orientar e fazer um pouso vertical na barcaça.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou o helicóptero Mars Ingenuity destravou as suas duas pás do rotor enquanto os preparativos continuam para o primeiro voo do veículo, que deve ocorrer no máximo neste domingo. O drone chegou a Marte a 18 de Fevereiro junto com o rover Perseverance da NASA, tendo feito a longa jornada até o Planeta Vermelho dentro do rover. A 4 de Abril, o pequeno drone separou-se do Perseverance, preparando-se para subir aos céus durante uma campanha de teste de um mês. Se a saída de domingo do Ingenuity for bem-sucedida, será o primeiro voo guiado com motor noutro planeta.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou um foguetão Falcon 9 da SpaceX lançou um novo lote de 60 satélites da Internet Starlink em órbita na tarde de quarta-feira e pousou no mar terminando mais uma missão bem-sucedida. O foguetão deste lançamento, chamado B1058, é um dos foguetões comprovados em voo da frota da SpaceX. Ele tem agora tem sete lançamentos e pousos no seu currículo e está rapidamente a destacar-se como um dos líderes da frota.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker assim como alguns videos interessantes.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.space.com/mars-helicopter-ingenuity-unlocks-rotor-blades">Mars helicopter Ingenuity unlocks its rotor blades to prepare for 1st flight on Red Planet</a></h2>

<p><em>"The Mars helicopter Ingenuity has unlocked its two rotor blades as preparations continue for the vehicle's first flight, due to occur no earlier than Sunday (April 11). Ingenuity arrived on Mars Feb. 18 along with NASA's Perseverance rover, having made the long trek out to the Red Planet tucked inside the rover's belly. As of April 4, the little chopper has parted ways with Perseverance, preparing to take to the skies during a month-long test campaign. If Ingenuity's Sunday sortie is successful, it will be the first powered, guided flight on another planet. "The blades of glory, aka rotor blades of the #MarsHelicopter, have been unlocked and are ready for testing," NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California wrote in a tweet posted early today (April 8). "Next, we'll do a slow-speed spin-up of the blades for the first time on the Martian surface.""</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/mars-helicopter-ingenuity-unlocks-rotor-blades">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-starlink-23-satellite-mission-launch-rocket-landing">SpaceX launches another 60 Starlink satellites into orbit and sticks rocket landing</a></h2>

<p><em>"A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched a new batch of 60 Starlink internet satellites into orbit on Wednesday afternoon (April 7) and nailed a landing at sea to top off a successful mission. The veteran Falcon 9 rocket blasted off from Space Launch Complex 40 here at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida at 12:34 p.m. EDT (1634 GMT), marking the company's 10th launch of the year. "Falcon 9 has successfully lifted off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station carrying our stack of Starlink satellites to orbit," Jessie Anderson, a SpaceX manufacturing engineer, said during a live webcast of the launch. Approximately nine minutes later, the rocket's first stage returned to Earth, touching down on SpaceX's drone ship "Of Course I Still Love You," for its seventh successful landing. SpaceX is continuing the rapid launch pace set last year, as the Hawthorne, California-based rocket builder celebrated its 10th launch so far in 2021. The majority of those launches have been SpaceX's own Starlink satellites, as the company inches closer to filling its initial internet constellation of 1,440 broadband satellites."</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-starlink-23-satellite-mission-launch-rocket-landing">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://news.microsoft.com/innovation-stories/datacenter-liquid-cooling/">To cool datacenter servers, Microsoft turns to boiling liquid</a></h2>

<p><em>"Emails and other communications sent between Microsoft employees are literally making liquid boil inside a steel holding tank packed with computer servers at this datacenter on the eastern bank of the Columbia River. Unlike water, the fluid inside the couch-shaped tank is harmless to electronic equipment and engineered to boil at 122 degrees Fahrenheit, 90 degrees lower than the boiling point of water. The boiling effect, which is generated by the work the servers are doing, carries heat away from laboring computer processors. The low-temperature boil enables the servers to operate continuously at full power without risk of failure due to overheating. Inside the tank, the vapor rising from the boiling fluid contacts a cooled condenser in the tank lid, which causes the vapor to change to liquid and rain back onto the immersed servers, creating a closed loop cooling system. “We are the first cloud provider that is running two-phase immersion cooling in a production environment,” said Husam Alissa, a principal hardware engineer on Microsoft’s team for datacenter advanced development in Redmond, Washington."</em> <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/innovation-stories/datacenter-liquid-cooling/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4338.html">Integrated 1.5A Synchronous Regulators from STMicroelectronics Simplify High-Efficiency Power Conversion</a></h2>

<p><em>"STMicroelectronics has introduced L6981 synchronous step-down regulators, extending the family of high-efficiency converters that simplify power-supply design by integrating power elements, feedback circuitry, and safety features on-chip. Rated to deliver up to 1.5A, with 90% typical efficiency at full load, the L6981 converters are available in two variants optimized for light-load efficiency and noise performance. The L6981C for low-current operation uses pulse skipping to maximize efficiency at light loads extending the runtime of battery-powered devices. The L6981N prioritizes low noise by operating permanently in PWM (pulse-width modulation) mode at constant switching frequency and minimizing voltage ripple at light loads. Both variants can accept an input voltage from 3.5V to 38V, making them well suited to use in 24V industrial bus-powered applications, 12V and 24V battery-powered equipment, HVAC power supplies, decentralized intelligent nodes, smart sensors, and always-on applications. The output voltage can be adjusted from 0.85V up to the input-voltage value using external resistors."</em> <a href="https://newsroom.st.com/media-center/press-item.html/n4338.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Texas Instruments (TI) (Nasdaq: TXN) today introduced a new family of synchronous DC/DC buck controllers that enable engineers to shrink the size of the power-supply solution and lower its electromagnetic interference (EMI). Featuring an integrated active EMI filter (AEF) and dual-random spread-spectrum (DRSS) technology, the LM25149-Q1 and LM25149 enable engineers to cut the area of the external EMI filter in half, lower the conducted EMI of the power design by as much as 55 dBµV across multiple frequency bands, or achieve a combination of reduced filter size and low EMI. For more information, see www.ti.com/LM25149-Q1-pr and www.ti.com/LM25149-pr. Reducing EMI in the power supply is a growing design challenge, especially as electronic content increases in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), automotive infotainment and cluster, building automation, and aerospace and defense designs. A traditional way to ensure that a design meets conducted EMI specifications involves increasing the size of the external passive EMI filter, which in turn increases the overall power supply solution size. By integrating the AEF, the LM25149-Q1 and LM25149 buck controllers enable engineers to meet EMI standards while increasing their design’s power density."</em> <a href="https://news.ti.com/industrys-first-dcdc-controllers-with-an-integrated-active-emi-filter-enable-engineers-to-achieve-smallest-low-emi-power-designs">[...]</a>

Clarke’s classic sci-fi novel “2001: A Space Odyssey” (Clarke blessed its use before launch), was sent to map the composition of the Martian surface, providing a window to the past so scientists could piece together how the planet evolved. But it’s done far more than that, uncovering troves of water ice, serving as a crucial communications link for other spacecraft, and helping to pave the way not just for safer landings but also future astronauts. Here’s a partial list of Odyssey’s many accomplishments. Mapping Martian Ice Odyssey’s two decades of data have been a boon for researchers working to determine where water ice is locked up on the planet.

The groundbreaking achievement produces colder antimatter than ever before and enables an entirely new class of experiments, helping scientists learn more about antimatter in future. In a paper published today in Nature, the collaboration reports that the temperature of antihydrogen atoms trapped inside a magnetic bottle is reduced when the atoms scatter light from an ultraviolet laser beam, slowing the atoms down and reducing the space they occupy in the bottle — both vital aspects of future more detailed studies of the properties of antimatter. In addition to showing that the energy of the antihydrogen atoms was decreased, the physicists also found a reduction in the range of wavelengths that the cold atoms can absorb or emit light on, so the spectral line (or colour band) is narrowed due to the reduced motion. This latter effect is of particular interest, as it will allow a more precise determination of the spectrum which in turn reveals the internal structure of the antihydrogen atoms.

For example, membranes in a battery separating the two terminals help to prevent short circuits, while also allowing the transport of charged particles, or ions, needed to maintain the flow of electricity. The most selective membranes – those with very specific criteria for what may pass through – suffer from low permeability for the working ion in the battery, which limits the battery’s power and energy efficiency. To overcome trade-offs between membrane selectivity and permeability, researchers are developing ways to increase the solubility and mobility of ions within the membrane, therefore allowing a higher number of them to transit through the membrane more rapidly.

As the team led by Prof. Tajmar reported last weekend at the “Space Propulsion Conference 2020 + 1” (which was postponed due to the Corona pandemic) and published in three accompanying papers in the “Proceedings of Space Propulsion Conference 2020 + 1” (Paper 1, Paper 2, Paper 3), they had to confirm the previously discussed interim results, according to which the EmDrive does not develop the thrust previously observed by other teams (such as NASA’s Eagleworks and others). The team also confirmed that the already measured thrust forces can be explained by external effects, as they have now been proven by Tajmar and colleagues using a highly sensitive experimental and measurement setup. On their work on the classical EmDrive Prof. Tajmar reports to GreWi-editor Andreas Müller: “We found out that the cause of the ‘thrust’ was a thermal effect. For our tests, we used NASAs EmDrive configuration from White et al."</em> <a href="https://www.grenzwissenschaft-aktuell.de/latest-emdrive-tests-at-dresden-university-shows-impossible-engine-does-not-develop-any-thrust20210321/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Scientists from Tohoku University have developed a new fluorine-free calcium (Ca) electrolyte based on a hydrogen (monocarborane) cluster that could potentially realize rechargeable Ca batteries. The researchers say the new material, achieved by designing the coordination structure of Ca cation with a weakly coordinating anion and mixed solvents, shows markedly improved electrochemical performances such as high conductivity and high electrochemical stabilities. Current lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries have some drawbacks. They are approaching their demand limits of theoretical energy density and cost, and lithium is not naturally plentiful. Calcium, however, is the fifth most abundant element in Earth's crust and its metal anode has low reduction potential (-2.87 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)) and volumetric capacities of 2072 mAh cm-3, giving it comparable cell voltage and energy density to those of Li. Calcium batteries are therefore cost effective and possess high battery performance, making them a suitable substitute for Li-batteries."</em> <a href="https://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/press/new_material_calcium_batteries.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"As environmental and energy crises become increasingly more common occurrences around the world, a thermal energy harvester capable of converting abundant thermal energy — such as solar radiation, waste heat, combustion of biomass, or geothermal energy — into mechanical energy appears to be a promising energy strategy to mitigate many crises. The majority of thermal power generation technologies involve solid moving parts, which can reduce their reliability and lead to frequent maintenance. This inspired researchers in China to develop a thermal power nanogenerator without solid moving parts. In Applied Physics Letters, from AIP Publishing, the researchers propose a thermal power nanogenerator, called a thermoacoustically driven liquid-metal-based triboelectric nanogenerator, or TA-LM-TENG, which converts thermal energy into electrical energy. “This generator includes two parts: a thermoacoustic engine and a liquid-metal-based triboelectric nanogenerator (LM-TENG),” said Guoyao Yu, a professor at the Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences. First, the thermoacoustic engine converts thermal energy into acoustic energy via oscillatory thermal expansion and contraction of a gas."</em> <a href="https://publishing.aip.org/publications/latest-content/thermal-power-nanogenerator-created-without-solid-moving-parts/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Quantum computing promises to harness the strange properties of quantum mechanics in machines that will outperform even the most powerful supercomputers of today. But the extent of their application, it turns out, isn’t entirely clear. To fully realize the potential of quantum computing, scientists must start with the basics: developing step-by-step procedures, or algorithms, for quantum computers to perform simple tasks, like the factoring of a number. These simple algorithms can then be used as building blocks for more complicated calculations. Prasanth Shyamsundar, a postdoctoral research associate at the Department of Energy’s Fermilab Quantum Institute, has done just that.

<p><em>"An extensive new calculation of the strength of the magnetic field around the muon — a sub-atomic particle similar to, but heavier than, an electron — closes the gap between theory and experimental measurements, bringing it in line with the standard model that has guided particle physics for decades. A paper describing the research by an international team of scientists appears April 8 in the journal Nature. Twenty years ago, in an experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory, physicists detected what seemed to be a discrepancy between measurements of the muon’s “magnetic moment” — the strength of its magnetic field — and theoretical calculations of what that measurement should be, raising the tantalizing possibility of physical particles or forces as yet undiscovered. The new finding shrinks this discrepancy, suggesting that the muon’s magnetism is likely not mysterious at all. To achieve this result, instead of relying on experimental data, researchers simulated every aspect of their calculations from the ground up — a task requiring massive supercomputing power. “Most of the phenomena in nature can be explained by what we call the ‘standard model’ of particle physics,” said Zoltan Fodor, professor of physics at Penn State and a leader of the research team."</em> <a href="https://news.psu.edu/story/653936/2021/04/07/research/muons-magnetic-moment-fits-just-fine">[...]</a>

The strong evidence that muons deviate from the Standard Model calculation might hint at exciting new physics. Muons act as a window into the subatomic world and could be interacting with yet undiscovered particles or forces. “Today is an extraordinary day, long awaited not only by us but by the whole international physics community,” said Graziano Venanzoni, co-spokesperson of the Muon g-2 experiment and physicist at the Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics. “A large amount of credit goes to our young researchers who, with their talent, ideas and enthusiasm, have allowed us to achieve this incredible result.” A muon is about 200 times as massive as its cousin, the electron."</em> <a href="https://news.fnal.gov/2021/04/first-results-from-fermilabs-muon-g-2-experiment-strengthen-evidence-of-new-physics/">[...]</a>

However, the process also creates a large amount of expensive and unsustainable waste and takes a long time, making it difficult for 3-D printing to be implemented on a wide scale. Each time a 3-D printer produces custom objects, especially unusually-shaped products, it also needs to print supports­–printed stands that balance the object as the printer creates layer by layer, helping maintain its shape integrity. However, these supports must be manually removed after printing, which requires finishing by hand and can result in shape inaccuracies or surface roughness. The materials the supports are made from often cannot be re-used, and so they’re discarded, contributing to the growing problem of 3-D printed waste material."</em> <a href="https://viterbischool.usc.edu/news/2021/04/how-a-moving-platform-for-3-d-printing-can-cut-waste-and-costs/">[...]</a>

In a chemical bond, the more electronegative atom gains extra electrons, becoming negatively charged, while the less electronegative one loses electrons and becomes positively charged. Electronegativity is a fundamental notion, essential for explaining things that range from the energy of chemical bonds to the (in)stability of chemical compounds and the color and hardness of crystals. Since then, chemists have come up with various definitions and scales of electronegativity.

<p><em>"Researchers detected non-negligible interactions between technologically intriguing 2D materials and the substrates that physically support them Atomically thin layers are of great technological interest because of potentially useful electronic properties that emerge as the layer thickness approaches the 2D limit. Such materials tend to form weak bonds outside the layer and are thus generally assumed to be unaffected by substrates that provide physical support. To make further progress, however, scientists must rigorously test this assumption, not only to better understand single-layer physics, but also because the existence of substrate effects raises the possibility of tuning layer properties by tweaking the substrate. As reported in the journal Physical Review Letters, a team led by Tai-Chang Chiang of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and his postdoctoral associate, Meng-Kai Lin, used Berkeley Lab’s Advanced Light Source (ALS) to probe changes in the electronic properties of a 2D semiconductor, titanium telluride, as the thickness of a substrate, platinum telluride, was increased. Single-layer titanium telluride is highly sensitive to what lies underneath, making it particularly useful as a test case for investigating substrate coupling effects. The results showed that as the substrate thickness increased, a dramatic and systematic variation occurred in the single-layer titanium telluride."</em> <a href="https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2021/04/02/actor-in-a-supporting-role-substrate-effects-on-2d-layers/">[...]</a>

Over the past four decades, astronomers had found about 50 of these "quadruply imaged quasars," or quads for short, which occur when the gravity of a massive galaxy that happens to sit in front of a quasar splits its single image into four.

But although scientists have made big advances in this very young field, they still don’t fully understand how to design spintronics materials that would allow for ultrasmall, ultrafast, low-power devices. Skyrmions may seem promising, but scientists have long treated skyrmions as merely 2D objects.

<p><em>"A group led by scientists from the RIKEN Cluster for Pioneering Research, using coordinated observations of the Crab pulsar in a number of frequencies, have discovered that the “giant radio pulses” which it emits include an increase in x-ray emissions in addition to the radio and visible light emissions that had been previously observed. This finding, published in Science, implies that these pulses are hundreds of times more energetic than previously believed and could provide insights into the mysterious phenomenon of “fast radio bursts (FRBs).” Giant radio pulses—a phenomenon where extremely short, millisecond-duration pulses of radio waves are emitted—have been observed in association with a dozen pulsars in our Galaxy, but little is known about the mechanism that causes them. It has been proposed that they may also be the origin of “fast radio bursts”—rapid bursts of radio waves that are believed to originate from energetic events in the extragalactic universe. To gain insights into these phenomena, the RIKEN-led group made coordinated observations of the Crab pulsar, one of the most famous and well-observed pulsars. The explosion of this star in a supernova explosion was witnessed by Chinese and Japanese observers in the year 1054 and led to the formation of the beautiful Crab Nebula that can still be seen today.

But this doesn't mean there are no options out there, many projects use the Fe1.1s as this IC is available in a SSOP28 which can be soldered with a bit of practice."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/a13_technology/hacker-friendly-usb-hub-f7a95a">[...]</a>

On my previous project (https://gregdavill.com/blog/2020/6/13/miniature-3456x-led-cube) I had overcome one of the major hurdles of creating a smaller cube, because I had designed and built my own custom high density* LED panels.

It is very important to disconnect the load before the battery enters into deep discharge as this may destroy or damage the battery cells. The circuit shown here turns off the load before the battery enters deep discharge and avoids a further (deep) discharge that can shorten the SLA battery life. Once the battery is recharged or replaced you need to push a reset switch to power ON the load. The predetermined load level is set to 12V, this voltage level is proportional to the battery voltage which is determined by resistor divider R2, and R9. Once the voltage falls below the setpoint (12V) it disconnects the load, the load-battery connection remains open until the system receives a manual reset command using tactile switch SW1."</em> <a href="https://www.electronics-lab.com/project/low-voltage-lead-acid-battery-disconnect-board-prevents-deep-discharge-of-12v-lead-acid-battery/">[...]</a>

A pocket-sized debugger that can monitor and display the data stream is the perfect solution for that! Details So how does it work? On the upper right corner, there's a pin header (RX, TX, GND) meant to be connected to the device you want to receive data from. The current iteration is only 5V tolerant, in the future we plan to add a switch to shift between the 5V and 3.3V logic levels."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/Zalmotek/serial-debugger-with-display-e62229">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A network of resistors behaves as a single resistor: the current through the network is proportional to the potential difference applied. Calculating the equivalent resistance of a network starts for many at high school but may come back later with more complex cases also at university. For success in science and engineering it is crucial to be skilled in these calculations but also to develop an intuition on how to make quick approximate solutions. Being an expert in handling electrical resistance networks will come into great use for other types of networks that have similar behaviour: magnetic circuits, fluid dynamics, heat conduction, traffic flow, just to name a few. To hear is to forget, to see is to remember, and to do is to understand, so let’s practice resistor networks hands-on! This tutorial is great for the class-room, since it can be performed by students individually or in small groups: the equipment is cheap and common (a multimeter and some crocodile clips) and the consumables are very cheap (7 resistors per experiment - they cost less than a cent each when bought in 100-packs) - The students can keep the final resistor network as a souvenir."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Series-Parallel-Kirchhoff/">[...]</a>
