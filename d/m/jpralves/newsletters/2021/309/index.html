<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1776, a matemática francesa <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Germain">Sophie Germain</a>. Ela ficou conhecida pelo seu trabalho em teoria dos números e contribuições para a matemática aplicada de acústica e elasticidade. Germain foi autodidacta por meio de livros e anotações de palestras fornecidas por amigos que frequentavam a Ecole Polytechnique, que ela, como mulher, não tinha permissão para assistir. Usando um pseudónimo masculino, M. LeBlanc, ela correspondeu-se com Lagrange, que reconheceu sua habilidade e, posteriormente, patrocinou o seu trabalho. Ela realizou uma prova limitada do último teorema de Fermat, para qualquer número primo abaixo de 100 onde certas condições foram satisfeitas. Em 1816, ela ganhou um prémio patrocinado por Napoleão por uma explicação matemática das figuras de Chladni, a vibração das placas elásticas.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1865, o químico austro-alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Adolf_Zsigmondy">Richard Zsigmondy</a>. Ele recebeu o Prémio Nobel da Química em 1925 pela “sua demonstração da natureza heterogénea das soluções colóides e pelos métodos que usou, que desde então se tornaram fundamentais na química colóide moderna.” Os colóides são compostos de partículas sub-microscópicas dispersas dentro doutra substância. Para conduzir a sua pesquisa sobre colóides, ele inventou o ultramicroscópio (1903), com o qual ele podia ver partículas com um diâmetro de um 10 milionésimo de milímetro não visíveis num microscópio convencional Ele usava um feixe de luz intenso orientado numa posição perpendicular ao eixo óptico do microscópio. À medida que as partículas espalhavam a luz incidente, os seus movimentos podiam ser vistos como flashes contra um fundo escuro.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1932, o cientista da computação norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Abramson">Norman Abramson</a>. Ele criou a ALOHANET, a primeira rede de dados moderna, que formou a base dos protocolos essenciais na Ethernet agora amplamente utilizados. Foi inaugurada em 1970, operando a 9600 bits por segundo, usando rádio para fornecer uma rede de dados comutada por pacote sem fio entre várias ilhas do Havai. As suas inovações incluíram os primeiros sensores de pacote de rádio, os primeiros repetidores de pacote de rádio, a primeira rede de pacote de satélite e o primeiro acesso de rádio à Internet. As patentes americanas de Abramson incluem a primeira patente para verificações de redundância CRC para fornecer técnica de controle de erros de dados (nº 3.114.130) e a primeira patente emitida para o projecto de erros de ruptura em sistemas digitais (nº 3.163.848).</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1933, o físico francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Cohen-Tannoudji">Claude Cohen-Tannoudji</a>. Ele partilhou o Prémio Nobel de Física em 1997 (com Steven Chu e William D. Phillips) por desenvolver métodos usando luz laser para arrefecer gases até a faixa de temperatura do micro-kelvin (quase zero absoluto a uma fracção de milionésimo de grau .) O movimento dos átomos arrefecidos é, portanto, suficientemente lento para permitir o seu estudo com grande precisão, e sua estrutura interna pode ser determinada. Cohen-Tannoudji criou armadilhas a laser que operam por um processo que desde então tem sido chamado de arrefecimento de Sísifo. A Trabalhar com átomos de hélio, usando seis feixes de laser, ele atingiu a temperatura de 0,18 µK. Sob essas condições, os átomos de hélio diminuíram para uma velocidade de apenas 2 cm/s.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1947, o matemático francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Connes">Alain Connes</a>. Ele ganhou a Medalha Fields em 1982 (concedida em 1983) pelo seu trabalho em teoria dos operadores. As suas contribuições mais notáveis são (1) classificação geral e um teorema de estrutura para factores do tipo III, obtido em sua tese (1973); (2) classificação dos automorfismos do factor hiperfinito, que serviu de preparação para a próxima contribuição; (3) classificação dos factores injectivos; e (4) aplicação da teoria das álgebras C * às folheações e geometria diferencial em geral. O trabalho recente de Connes foi sobre geometria não comutativa e ele estudou aplicações à física teórica.</p>

<p>A 1 de Abril de 1960 era lançado o Satélite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIROS-1">Tiros-1</a>. Foi o primeiro satélite de observação do tempo, foi lançado do Cabo Kennedy e tirou a primeira imagem televisiva do espaço. Foi o primeiro de vários lançados no programa TIROS, nomeado a partir de sua função: Televisão por satélite de observação infravermelho, e foi o primeiro passo experimental da NASA para determinar se os satélites poderiam ser úteis no estudo da Terra. Naquela época, a eficácia das observações de satélite ainda não estava comprovada. Assim, várias questões de desenho para satélites foram testadas: instrumentos, dados e parâmetros operacionais. O objectivo era melhorar a aplicação de satélites para decisões relacionadas à Terra, como "devemos evacuar a costa por causa do furacão?" O TIROS provou ser extremamente bem-sucedido na previsão do tempo.</p>

<p>Faz hoje 45 anos que era fundada por três amigos a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.">Apple Computer Company</a>. Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak e Ronald Wayne fundaram a empresa para desenvolver e comercializar o Apple I desenvolvido por Wozniak. Ronald desistiu ao fim de apenas 12 dias e vendeu a sua quota aos dois restantes membros. Nascia aqui uma companhia que quer se queira quer não tem criado um conjunto de tendências e de sistemas que ainda hoje são uma referência no mundo do IT.</p>

<p>Em 2004 era lançado o <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmail">Gmail</a> o serviço de correio gratuito da Google. Os utilizadores podem aceder ao Gmail na web e usando programas de terceiros que sincronizam o conteúdo do e-mail por meio dos protocolos POP3 ou IMAP4. O Gmail começou como uma versão beta limitada e encerrou sua fase de testes a 7 de Julho de 2009. Em Outubro de 2019, o Gmail tinha 1,5 mil milhões de utilizadores activos em todo o mundo.</p>

<p><em>"The rover also snapped a pair of panoramas to create a 3D view of the stark cliff face featured in the selfie. At the start of March, NASA’s Curiosity Mars rover began approaching an impressive rock formation that scientists dubbed “Mont Mercou,” a nickname taken from a mountain in France. Standing about 20 feet (6 meters) tall, the outcrop is captured in all its majesty in a new selfie, as well as in a pair of panoramas that offer a 3D view. The selfie shows Curiosity in front of Mont Mercou with a new drill hole nearby at a rock sample nicknamed “Nontron” – the mission’s 30th sample to date. Curiosity’s drill powderized the sample before trickling it into instruments inside the rover so the science team could get a better understanding of the rock’s composition and what clues it might offer about Mars’ past. This area is at the transition between the “clay-bearing unit” Curiosity is departing and the “sulfate-bearing unit” that’s ahead on Mount Sharp, the 3-mile-tall (5-kilometer-tall) mountain that the rover has been rolling up since 2014."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-curiosity-mars-rover-takes-selfie-with-mont-mercou">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-develops-new-5g-radio-technology-for-efficient-5g-deployments-in-mid-band-spectrum">Samsung Develops New 5G Radio Technology for Efficient 5G Deployments in Mid-Band Spectrum</a></h2>

<p><em>"New Samsung technology doubles bandwidth support of its mid-band portfolio, helping operators minimize hardware needs and simplify 5G rollouts Samsung Electronics has developed a new 5G wideband radio technology that expands bandwidth support for its next generation radios, including Massive MIMO radios, to help operators drive more flexible and cost-effective 5G deployments. With this new technology, Samsung will extend the bandwidth support of its 5G radios to 400MHz—double the 200MHz supported by its current commercial radios. With wider bandwidth support, Samsung’s radios will help operators maximize the utility of their mid-band spectrum for 5G networks, while using less hardware. The new technology will help operators minimize the number of radios required when managing spectrum in various deployment scenarios. This includes when an operator owns non-contiguous frequencies within 400MHz of bandwidth. Operators can also use this solution for RAN sharing, where they actively share network infrastructures with other operators through joint deployments."</em> <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-develops-new-5g-radio-technology-for-efficient-5g-deployments-in-mid-band-spectrum">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Earlier today, the United States Army announced that it will work with Microsoft on the production phase of the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) program as it moves from rapid prototyping to production and rapid fielding. The IVAS headset, based on HoloLens and augmented by Microsoft Azure cloud services, delivers a platform that will keep Soldiers safer and make them more effective. The program delivers enhanced situational awareness, enabling information sharing and decision-making in a variety of scenarios. Microsoft has worked closely with the U.S. Army over the past two years, and together we pioneered Soldier Centered Design to enable rapid prototyping for a product to provide Soldiers with the tools and capabilities necessary to achieve their mission. We appreciate the partnership with the U.S. Army, and are thankful for their continued trust in transitioning IVAS from rapid prototyping to rapid fielding. We look forward to building on this successful partnership with the men and women of the U.S. Army Close Combat Force."</em> <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/03/31/army-moves-microsoft-hololens-based-headset-from-prototyping-to-production-phase/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Single processor solutions will inevitably have to trade-off the processor's computational power against its efficiency. When that trade-off becomes too great, developers look towards dual-core solutions. Tomorrow’s commercial products will demand connectivity solutions to support advanced, highly-complex applications while also reducing time-to-market and development risk. Two cores better than one In a dual-core wireless SoC, one powerful processor with a high clock rate can be dedicated to the computational heavy lifting (and then switched off to save power until it is next needed). The other, a power-optimized processor with a slower clock, can be dedicated to wireless networking. Better yet, each core can also run its own software, preventing clashes between application code and RF protocol and allowing optimized algorithms for their destined processor."</em> <a href="https://blog.nordicsemi.com/getconnected/first-nrf5340-modules-eliminate-processor-trade-off-for-developers">[...]</a>

<p><em>"SpaceX's latest Starship prototype, SN11, took to the skies over Texas on Tuesday morning (March 30), following a 24-hour delay. That wasn't the first delay for the test. On Friday (March 25), SpaceX hoped to conduct the test flight after changing out one of the craft's three Raptor engines. Ultimately the test was moved to Monday and then finally happened early Tuesday morning, when the Starship SN11 rocket blasted off from SpaceX's Starbase test site near Boca Chica Village in South Texas at 8 a.m. local time (9 a.m. EDT, 1300 GMT). The rocket soared to an altitude of 6.2 miles (10 kilometers) before beginning the landing procedure.

Despite its age, this technology remains at the heart of modern electronics and optics industries. Semiconducting alloys, for instance, can be engineered to optimize a device’s electrical, mechanical and optical properties. Alloys of oxygen with group III elements, such as aluminum, gallium, and indium, are important semiconductor materials with vast applications in high-power electronics, solar-blind photodetectors and transparent devices.

The result unlocks a new potential for the actinide elements at the bottom of the periodic table and point to a fresh direction in research on topological quantum materials. “We found that the large spin-orbit coupling and strong electronic correlations in a system of uranium-cobalt-aluminum doped with ruthenium resulted in a colossal anomalous Nernst conductivity,” said Filip Ronning, lead investigator on the paper published today in Science Advances. Ronning is director of the Institute for Materials Science at Los Alamos National Laboratory. “It illustrates that uranium and actinide alloys are promising materials to study the interplay among a material’s topology and strong electron correlations.

Now, an international interdisciplinary team led by MIT has come up with a new approach to narrowing the search for the best candidates for long-lasting perovskite formulations, out of a vast number of potential combinations. Already, their system has zeroed in on one composition that in the lab has improved on existing versions more than tenfold.

Entanglement, simply put, is when the quantum state of each particle or a group of particles is not independent of the quantum states of other particles or groups, even over long distances. Entangled particles have always fascinated physicists, as measuring one entangled particle can result in a change in another entangled particle, famously dismissed as “spooky action at a distance” by Einstein. By now, physicists understand this strange effect and how to make use of it, for example to increase the sensitivity of measurements.

<p><em>"A pantograph is a simple series of levers of a set length that can be used to enlarge or reduce and existing shape. Very often used for drawing, this version is a small &amp; cheap DIY version of the typically larger and more expensive engraving pantographs that can be bought. The engraving pantograph differs in design from a drawing pantograph (often used with pencils) in that for a drawing pantograph, either the tracing point or the pencil (depending on if you are enlarging or reducing) will coincide with one of the pivot locations. As we are using this for engraving with a Rotary Tool for engraving, this would make it much more complex, so to avoid this, I have moved the position of the Rotary Tool away from the pivot allowing us to use a very simple pivot. This changes the geometry of the levers slightly but makes the pivot design and mounting the Rotary Tool much simpler whilst still getting the same result. A pantograph can be used to either enlarge or reduce, for this design I have chosen to make it reduce only, for a number of reasons; Due to the simple pivots I'm using, accuracy won't be as good as it could be and when enlarging and errors are magnified, which depending on how loose the pivots are, might be visible in the enlarged engraving."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Make-a-Wooden-Engraving-Pantograph/">[...]</a>

The effect isn’t quite as funky but it’s easier and shows how the LED’s are on a grid, instead of making it look like a hex pattern - The software was largely rewritten to make it more flexible and allow for sprite - based animations I ended up coding not just a clock but something that is almost a 23x7 pixel full colour LED display, with a set of different animations."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Animated-LED-Clock/">[...]</a>
