<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1788, o físico, astrónomo e explorador irlandês-inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Sabine">Edward Sabine</a>. Ele estudou a forma da Terra e o seu campo magnético. Foi nomeado na Artilharia Real, e atingiu o posto de Major-General antes de se reformar em 1877. Como explorador, o astrónomo do partido, juntou-se à expedição de John Ross para encontrar a Passagem do Noroeste (1818). Também foi com Parry numa expedição ao Árctico (1819-20). Através de experiências utilizando um pêndulo em diferentes locais globais, ele determinou a forma da Terra (1821-3). Sabine também estudou o campo magnético da Terra, e a 6 de Abril de 1852 anunciou a ligação entre manchas solares e variações geomagnéticas irregulares.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1840, o físico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Kohlrausch_(physicist)">Friedrich Wilhelm Georg Kohlrausch</a>. Ele investigou as propriedades dos electrólitos (substâncias que conduzem electricidade em soluções por transferência de iões) e contribuiu para a compreensão do seu comportamento. Algumas das realizações pioneiras de Kohlrausch incluem medições de condutividade em electrólitos, o seu trabalho na determinação de grandezas magnéticas e eléctricas básicas, e o aperfeiçoamento das tecnologias de medição associadas. Foi sob a sua direcção que a "Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt" (o então Instituto Imperial Técnico Físico na Alemanha) criou numerosas normas e padrões de calibração que foram também utilizados internacionalmente fora da Alemanha.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1857, o inventor norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elwood_Haynes">Elwood Haynes</a>. Ele construiu um dos primeiros automóveis a gasolina de sucesso. Em 1886, quando o gás natural foi encontrado na sua cidade natal de Portland, Indiana, Haynes organizou uma empresa para o fornecer à cidade. Ele concebeu um método para desidratar o gás antes de este ser bombeado através das linhas. Também em 1886, inventou um pequeno termóstato de vapor utilizado no gás natural. Em 1893, comprou um motor a gasolina e concebeu uma "carruagem sem cavalos". Quando Haynes estava à procura de uma liga que fizesse um eléctrodo de vela durável, inventou a liga de stellite, cuja invenção ainda hoje contribui para a sociedade. Mais duro que o aço e resistente à corrosão, este metal desempenha agora um papel importante no fabrico de materiais aeronáuticos adequados para a exploração do espaço exterior.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1908, o engenheiro electrotécnico norte-americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Harold_Brown">George Harold Brown</a>. Ele foi pioneiro em rádio-térmica, que deu grandes contribuições para o desenvolvimento de antenas de rádio e televisão. Em 1936, Brown inventou a chamada antena de estilo "turnstyle" para a radiodifusão televisiva. Devido a isso, a Comissão Federal de Comunicações (FCC) adoptou um sistema de TV de 441 linhas. Em 1938, Brown desenvolveu o filtro de banda lateral vestigial para utilização na transmissão de televisão, duplicando a resolução horizontal das imagens de televisão em qualquer banda. Durante a II Guerra Mundial, com os investigadores da RCA, o grupo de George Brown utilizou o aquecimento por radiofrequência na desidratação a granel da penicilina na E.R. Squibb, uma "máquina de costura" para termoplásticos, e técnicas de rebitagem e soldadura mais consistentes.</p>

<p>Em 1947, Chuck Yeager, um piloto de caça da II Guerra Mundial, tornou-se o primeiro humano a voar mais rápido do que a velocidade do som, quebrando a barreira do som num avião Bell XS-1 movido a foguete sobre o Murac Dry Lake, Califórnia. Os quatro motores de foguetão deste minúsculo avião de investigação com nariz de agulha podiam engolir todo um fornecimento de combustível em 2-1/2 minutos. Para poupar combustível, o Bell XS-1 foi transportado para altitude por um B-29 e depois lançado, e Yeager disparou os seus foguetes. A 37.000 pés, o X-1 voou bem, mas começou a bater à medida que se aproximava da barreira do som. Quando um avião viaja à velocidade do som, as partículas de ar à frente são comprimidas numa "parede de ar espesso" invisível.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou foi lançado o Ubuntu 21.10. Denominado de "Impish Indri" esta versão que não é LTS traz como principais novidades o Desktop GNOME 40, o Kernel 5.13, PHP 8.0, GCC 11, Mesa 21.2 e utiliza a compressão Zstd para os pacotes Debian. Traz também suporte para a ultima versão dos drivers proprietários da NVIDIA com Wayland.</p>

<h2><a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-starts-mass-production-of-most-advanced-14nm-euv-ddr5-dram">Samsung Starts Mass Production of Most Advanced 14nm EUV DDR5 DRAM</a></h2>

<p><em>"Samsung's new five-layer EUV process enables the industry’s highest DRAM bit density, enhancing productivity by approximately 20% Based on the latest DDR5 standard, Samsung’s 14nm DRAM will be ideal for handling ever-growing AI and 5G workloads Samsung Electronics, the world leader in advanced memory technology, today announced that it has begun mass producing the industry’s smallest, 14-nanometer (nm), DRAM based on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) technology. Following the company’s shipment of the industry-first EUV DRAM in March of last year, Samsung has increased the number of EUV layers to five to deliver today’s finest, most advanced DRAM process for its DDR5 solutions. “We have led the DRAM market for nearly three decades by pioneering key patterning technology innovations,” said Jooyoung Lee, Senior Vice President and Head of DRAM Product &amp; Technology at Samsung Electronics. “Today, Samsung is setting another technology milestone with multi-layer EUV that has enabled extreme miniaturization at 14nm — a feat not possible with the conventional argon fluoride (ArF) process. Building on this advancement, we will continue to provide the most differentiated memory solutions by fully addressing the need for greater performance and capacity in the data-driven world of 5G, AI and the metaverse.” As DRAM continues to scale down the 10nm-range, EUV technology becomes increasingly important to improve patterning accuracy for higher performance and greater yields. By applying five EUV layers to its 14nm DRAM, Samsung has achieved the highest bit density while enhancing the overall wafer productivity by approximately 20%."</em> <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-starts-mass-production-of-most-advanced-14nm-euv-ddr5-dram">[...]</a>

<p><em>"NASA, along with the European Space Agency, is developing a campaign to return the Martian samples to Earth. On Sept. 1, NASA’s Perseverance rover unfurled its arm, placed a drill bit at the Martian surface, and drilled about 2 inches, or 6 centimeters, down to extract a rock core. The rover later sealed the rock core in its tube. This historic event marked the first time a spacecraft packed up a rock sample from another planet that could be returned to Earth by future spacecraft. Mars Sample Return is a multi-mission campaign designed to retrieve the cores Perseverance will collect over the next several years. Currently in the concept design and technology development phase, the campaign is one of the most ambitious endeavors in spaceflight history, involving multiple spacecraft, multiple launches, and dozens of government agencies."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/with-first-martian-samples-packed-perseverance-initiates-remarkable-sample-return-mission">[...]</a>

<p><em>"NVIDIA dominates the parallel computing industry largely thanks to its own solution, CUDA. In response to this domain, AMD has published the source code of GPUFORT , a project that will be under Radeon Open eCosystem (ROCm) and that aims to offer a translation tool so that large code bases in CUDA can work outside of the closed ecosystem. of the green giant. The domain of CUDA and the fact that it is proprietary and owned by NVIDIA greatly limits the ability of developers to migrate to an alternative, so AMD has been working for a long time on mechanisms that help migrate specific CUDA code to interfaces compatible with its parallel computing stack supported by Radeon technology. Most of AMD’s efforts so far have focused on code written in C and C ++. GPUFORT, for its part, is to provide support for the translation from source to source ( source to source ) of CUDA Fortran and Fortran code based on OpenACC to OpenMP 4.5+ for execution on GPU or Fortran + HIP C ++ code ."</em> <a href="https://www.itsfoss.net/amd-publishes-gpufort/">[...]</a>

From ancient Greece through modern times, researchers have steadily improved upon humanity’s fundamental understanding of magnets. For over 100 years, magnetism has been known to emerge in solid-state materials when, due to electronic and chemical interactions, the electronic spins (a quantum mechanical property) and their motion around atoms develop a fixed orientation within the material. Ever since this discovery, physicists, chemists, and materials scientists have developed extensive theoretical and experimental machinery to predict and characterize magnetic materials. Despite an intense effort comprising multiple competing theories (and several Nobel prizes), a unified description of magnetic structures within materials has remained surprisingly elusive. In fact, even the most successful classification system for magnetic materials, developed almost 75 years ago by the Soviet scientist Lev Shubnikov, was incomplete, until now."</em> <a href="https://www.ehu.eus/en/web/campusa-magazine/-/longstanding-magnetic-materials-classification-problem-solved">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Berkeley Lab-led research key to next-gen quantum computing and technologies In 1998, researchers including Mark Kubinec of UC Berkeley performed one of the first simple quantum computations using individual molecules. They used pulses of radio waves to flip the spins of two nuclei in a molecule, with each spin’s “up” or “down” orientation storing information in the way that a “0” or “1” state stores information in a classical data bit. In those early days of quantum computers, the combined orientation of the two nuclei – that is, the molecule’s quantum state – could only be preserved for brief periods in specially tuned environments. In other words, the system quickly lost its coherence. Control over quantum coherence is the missing step to building scalable quantum computers. Now, researchers are developing new pathways to create and protect quantum coherence."</em> <a href="https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2021/10/12/team-unlocks-quantum-future/">[...]</a>

Combining a careful balance of thin-film strain, distortion, and thickness, the team has stabilised a new intermediate phase in one of the few known room-temperature multiferroic materials. The theoretical and experimental US-Australian study shows that this new phase has an electromechanical figure of merit over double its usual value, and that we can even transform between this intermediate phase to other phases easily using an electric field. As well as providing a valuable new technique to the toolkit of all international material scientists working with multiferroics and epitaxy, the results finally shed light on how epitaxial techniques can be used to enhance functional response of materials for future application in next -generation devices. STRESS CHANGES EVERYTHING If 2020-21 has taught us anything, it’s that stress changes everything."</em> <a href="http://www.fleet.org.au/blog/stress-can-be-good-for-you-enhancing-piezoelectric-properties-under-pressure/">[...]</a>

A group of TU Delft researchers has now demonstrated the ability to teleport an arbitrary qubit state from a single photon onto an optomechanical device – consisting of a mechanical structure comprising billions of atoms. Their breakthrough research, now published in Nature Photonics, enables real-world applications such as quantum internet repeater nodes while also allowing quantum mechanics itself to be studied in new ways. Quantum optomechanics The field of quantum optomechanics uses optical means to control mechanical motion in the quantum regime. The first quantum effects in microscale mechanical devices were demonstrated about ten years ago. Focussed efforts have since resulted in entangled states between optomechanical devices as well as demonstrations of an optomechanical quantum memory."</em> <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/2021/tnw/tu-delft-researchers-realize-quantum-teleportation-onto-mechanical-motion-of-silicon-beams">[...]</a>

<p><em>"New research demonstrates great promise of all-inorganic perovskite solar cells for improving the efficiencies of solar cells Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites have already demonstrated very high photovoltaic efficiencies of greater than 25%. The prevailing wisdom in the field is that the organic (carbon- and hydrogen-containing) molecules in the material are crucial to achieving this impressive performance because they are believed to suppress defect-assisted carrier recombination. New research in the UC Santa Barbara materials department has shown not only that this assumption is incorrect, but also that all-inorganic materials have the potential for outperforming hybrid perovskites. The findings are published in the article “All-inorganic halide perovskites as candidates for efficient solar cells(link is external),” which appears on the cover of the October 20 issue of the journal Cell Reports Physical Science. “To compare the materials, we performed comprehensive simulations of the recombination mechanisms,” explained Xie Zhang, lead researcher on the study. “When light shines on a solar-cell material, the photo-generated carriers generate a current; recombination at defects destroys some of those carriers and hence lowers the efficiency."</em> <a href="https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2021/020434/sunny-outlook-solar">[...]</a>

The study shows how mixing multiple molecules – up to eight at a time – can result in a material that performs as well as the best currently known glass formers. ​A glass, also known as an ‘amorphous solid’, is a material that does not have a long-range ordered structure – it does not form a crystal. Crystalline materials on the other hand, are those with a highly ordered and repeating pattern. The fact that a glass does not contain crystals is what makes it useful.

<p><em>"“Tuning” the interface and twist angle of layered 2D materials enhances key properties A new generation of electronics and optoelectronics may soon be possible by controlling twist angles in a particular type of bilayer 2D material used in these devices, strengthening the intrinsic electric charge that exists between the two layers, according to researchers from Penn State, Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Rutgers University. The researchers worked with regular transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) 2D materials and Janus TMDs, a class of 2D materials named after the Roman god of duality, Janus. These bilayer 2D materials have an interaction between layers known as a van der Waals interlayer coupling that leads to a charge transfer, a process important to the functionality of electronic devices. The charge transfer for both sides of conventional TMDs is the same due to each side having the same type of atoms. In the case of Janus TMD materials, the atoms on each side of the material are different types, leading to varied charge transfer when each side is in contact with other 2D materials. “In our study, the two types of atoms on each side of the Janus TMD material were sulfur and selenium,” said Shengxi Huang, assistant professor of electrical engineering and biomedical engineering at Penn State and co-author of the study recently published in ACS Nano."</em> <a href="https://news.psu.edu/story/672481/2021/10/13/research/new-twist-2d-materials-may-lead-improved-electronic-optical-devices">[...]</a>

This section includes a brief video demonstration of the rotary dial's use as an input to a microcontroller. While disassembling a few legacy phones, I was excited to learn that their dials are completely self-contained devices that operates as mechanical switch. When the user draws the dial back to a specific number the switch will periodically open that number of times, with a specific timing that is dictated by the rotary dial’s inner clockwork. In order to test the possibility of using the device to act as a sort of keypad, the circuit depicted in the top diagram was constructed."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Rotary-Dial-Arduino-Input/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Wireless Audio Transmission using Li-Fi using Red Pitaya Wireless Audio Transmission using Li-Fi Introduction to Li-Fi Li-Fi (also written as LiFi) acronym for Light Fidelity is a wireless communication technology that utilizes light to transmit data and position between devices. It is capable of transmitting data at high speeds over visible light, ultraviolet, and infrared spectrums. In its present state, only LED lamps can be used for the transmission of data in visible light. In terms of its end-use, the technology is similar to Wi-Fi — the key technical difference being that Wi-Fi uses radio frequency to induce a voltage in an antenna to transmit data, whereas Li-Fi uses the modulation of light intensity to transmit data. Li-Fi can theoretically transmit at speeds of up to 100 Gbit/s. Li-Fi's ability to safely function in areas otherwise susceptible to electromagnetic interference (e.g."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/yeshvanth_muniraj/wireless-audio-transmission-using-li-fi-0beee1">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Tracking the tides and weather at your favorite beach. My parents recently got a place on the water and have been obsessed with looking up the tides everyday so I decided to build them a custom TideTracker. The idea is to present the predicted high and low times for the day and a plot showing the tide over the last 24 hours. In addition to that I added some basic weather data to give them info at a glance. This project uses a Raspberry Pi for the brains and an E-Ink display for the information. When researching the project initially I found a similar project by Luke Haas that I used to test the display's functionality before writing my own program, check that project out here."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/ssbaker/e-ink-tide-and-weather-tracker-21447b">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Fully 3D-printable hydraulics for all your robotics projects Recently saw a video of Boston Dynamics it's Atlas robot doing all kind of awesome stuff and learned that the robots were fully hydraulic. I was wondering if it would be possible to build a fully 3D-printable hydraulic system that's watertight and can be used for robotics. This double helical gear pump is the first component of the fully 3D-printable hydraulic system. As mentioned above i thought it would be nice to test if it would be possible to 3D-print watertight hydraulic parts. Gears The gears used inside the pump are double helical gears, also called herringbone gears. I chose to go for this type because they produce less noise compared to regular spur gears."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/bribro12/3d-printable-double-helical-gear-pump-watertight-15cfb0">[...]</a>
