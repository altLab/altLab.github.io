<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1794, o químico alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eilhard_Mitscherlich">Eilhard Mitscherlich</a>. Ele foi responsável por ter difundido o princípio do isomorfismo, após no início da sua carreira (por volta de 1820) descobriu a importância da semelhança da forma cristalina entre os compostos químicos. Ele começou a sua educação estudando medicina, mas o seu interesse mudou para a química e, em particular, a cristalografia. Ele trabalhou no laboratório de Berzelius (1820-22). Mitscherlich desenvolveu ainda mais a sua teoria do isomorfismo. Em 1834, ele destilou a seco o sal de cálcio do ácido benzóico para obter benzeno, entre outras pesquisas notáveis sobre os derivados do benzeno. Seguindo um interesse em geologia e mineralogia, ele produziu minerais artificiais. A indústria alemã de celulose cresceu a partir do processo Mitscherlich para extrair celulose da madeira.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1827, o topógrafo e engenheiro escocês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandford_Fleming">Sandford Fleming</a>. Ele emigrou aos 17 anos para Quebec, Canadá, em 24 de Abril de 1845, como agrimensor. Mais tarde, ele tornou-se um dos mais importantes engenheiros ferroviários do seu tempo. Enquanto era responsável pelo levantamento inicial da Canadian Pacific Railway, a primeira ferrovia canadiana a cruzar o continente, ele percebeu os problemas de coordenar uma ferrovia tão longa. Isso o levou à ideia de fusos horários, cuja contribuição para a adopção do actual sistema de fusos horários lhe rendeu o título de "Pai do Horário Padrão". Fleming também desenhou o primeiro selo postal canadiano. Lançado em 1851, custava três centavos e representava o castor, agora o animal nacional do Canadá.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1871, o matemático francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Borel">Émile Borel</a>. Ele, juntamente com René Baire e Henri Lebesgue, esteve entre os pioneiros da teoria da medida e sua aplicação à teoria da probabilidade. Num de seus livros sobre probabilidade, ele propôs a experiência de pensamento de que um macaco carregando em teclas ao acaso numa máquina de escrever irá - com certeza absoluta - escrever todos os livros da Bibliothèque nationale de France (Biblioteca Nacional) da França. Isto agora é popularmente conhecido como <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem">teorema do macaco infinito</a>. Ele foi o primeiro a desenvolver (1899) uma teoria sistemática para uma série divergente. Ele também publicou (1921-27) uma série de artigos de pesquisa sobre a teoria dos jogos e se tornou o primeiro a definir jogos de estratégia.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1920, o industrial e inventor britânico <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alastair_Pilkington">Alastair Pilkington</a>. Ele inventou o processo de vidro cristal "float", prático para a indústria, que substituiu o antigo método de fabricação de vidro plano. Ele desenvolveu a sua ideia em meados da década de 1950 e a anunciou ao público em 1959. Demorou três anos a mais para atingir uma produção consistente e lucrativa. Em 1962, o processo foi licenciado para uso nos EUA, seguido em breve pelo resto do mundo. O vidro plano com superfícies paralelas e brilhantes era fabricado a partir de uma fita contínua de vidro derretido saindo do forno e flutuando numa longa camada de estanho derretido. Nesta mesa, o vidro permanecia quente por tempo suficiente para que as irregularidades se alisassem, dispensando a necessidade de polimento posterior.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1941, o químico britânico <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_E._Walker">John E. Walker</a>. Ele partilhou o Prémio Nobel de Química em 1997 pelo seu trabalho pioneiro sobre como a enzima ATP sintase catalisa a formação do composto de adenosina trifosfato de "alta energia" (ATP). Estas moléculas de ATP funcionam como portadoras de energia em todos os organismos vivos, sejam bactérias simples, fungos ou plantas, ou ainda em animais superiores e humanos. O ATP absorve a energia química libertada quando os nutrientes são metabolizados e transporta essa energia para as várias reacções que requerem energia. Estas reacções incluem a construção de células, a contracção das fibras musculares ou sinais nervosos.</p>

<p>E nesta primeira semana de 2021 ficamos a saber os trabalhos para a ligação via cabo submarino da EllaLink entre a América do Sul e Portugal foram concluídos. O cabo de fibra óptica de última geração que liga Portugal à América Latina já chegou a Sines. O sistema deverá estar totalmente operacional no segundo trimestre de 2021, tornando Portugal a nova porta de acesso à Europa para um nível de conectividade internacional sem precedentes. Ao criar a rota directa mais curta entre a Europa e a América Latina, evitando a passagem por países terceiros, a EllaLink reduz a latência em 50% em relação à infraestrutura actual, atingindo um valor real inferior a 60ms entre Portugal e o Brasil.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana um estudo revelou que os 28 dias mais rápidos (curtos) de que há registo desde 1960 ocorreram todos em 2020. Isto significa que a Terra está a girar a um velocidade superior ao normal. Se esta circunstância não é alarmante, porque o planeta, devido a diversos fenómenos físicos, varia ligeiramente o tempo total de rotação, é no entanto uma preocupação para o alinhamento com os sistemas de manutenção de tempo que se baseiam nos sistemas que usam os ultra-precisos relógios atómicos. Até agora, estes ajustes consistiam em adicionar um "segundo de salto" ao ano no final de Junho ou Dezembro, colocando o tempo astronómico e o tempo atómico de volta à sintonia. Esses segundos de salto foram acrescentados porque a tendência geral da rotação da Terra tem diminuído desde o início da medição precisa dos satélites no final dos anos 1960 e início dos anos 1970. Desde 1972, os cientistas adicionaram segundos de salto a cada ano e meio, em média, de acordo com o NIST. A última adição foi em 2016, quando na véspera de Ano Novo às 23 horas, 59 minutos e 59 segundos, um "segundo de salto" extra foi adicionado. No entanto, de acordo com a Time and Date, a recente aceleração na rotação da Terra fez com que os cientistas falassem pela primeira vez sobre um segundo de salto negativo. Em vez de adicionar um segundo, eles podem precisar de subtrair um. Isto porque a duração média de um dia é de 86.400 segundos, mas um dia astronómico em 2021 será 0,05 milissegundos mais curto, em média. Ao longo do ano, isso representará um atraso de 19 milissegundos no tempo atómico.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos assim como projetos de maker.</p>

<p>Aproveito para desejar a todos um excelente 2021.</p>

<h2><a href="https://ella.link/2021/01/06/ellalinks-transatlantic-submarine-cable-has-already-anchored-in-portugal/">EllaLink’s transatlantic submarine cable has already anchored in Portugal</a></h2>

<p><em>"The state-of-the-art fiber optic cable that connects Portugal and Latin America has already arrived in Sines. The system should be fully operational in the second quarter of 2021, making Portugal the new gateway to Europe to an unprecedented level of international connectivity. EllaLink announces today that its next generation low-latency submarine cable system has already anchored in Sines, from where the connection to Latin America will be established. It is expected to become fully operational in the second quarter of this year, providing an unprecedented level of international connectivity between the two continents, which will reach Europe through Portugal. With this operation with an investment of 150 million euros, pointed out as one of the big bets for the Portuguese Presidency of the European Commission, EllaLink will open a “corridor” for the transmission of data between the two continents, providing new opportunities to the European market. In addition to the first direct high-speed submarine cable connection between Europe and Latin America, the EllaLink system also includes several land routes that link strategic Data Centers in Lisbon, Madrid, Marseille, São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Fortaleza in partnership with Equinix and Interxion."</em> <a href="https://ella.link/2021/01/06/ellalinks-transatlantic-submarine-cable-has-already-anchored-in-portugal/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.livescience.com/earth-spinning-faster-negative-leap-second.html">Earth is whipping around quicker than it has in a half-century</a></h2>

<p><em>"It could mean a "negative" leap second. Even time did not escape 2020 unscathed. The 28 fastest days on record (since 1960) all occurred in 2020, with Earth completing its revolutions around its axis milliseconds quicker than average. That's not particularly alarming — the planet's rotation varies slightly all the time, driven by variations in atmospheric pressure, winds, ocean currents and the movement of the core. But it is inconvenient for international timekeepers, who use ultra-accurate atomic clocks to meter out the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) by which everyone sets their clocks. When astronomical time, set by the time it takes the Earth to make one full rotation, deviates from UTC by more than 0.4 seconds, UTC gets an adjustment."</em> <a href="https://www.livescience.com/earth-spinning-faster-negative-leap-second.html">[...]</a>

<p><em>"New AC-DC controller plus Inde-Flux™ transformer technology licensed to Würth Elektronik eiSos simplifies design, reducing size and cost In modern offline AC-DC power solutions, programmability and adaptive control offer the flexibility and intelligence needed by smart home devices to better interface with their power systems. In these systems, a secondary side microcontroller (MCU) is typically not capable of starting a system without the use of a separate bias power supply. A new reference design from Microchip Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP) solves this problem using the MCP1012 high voltage auxiliary AC-DC controller, demonstrating the ability to remove the independent bias power supply in many applications. The MCP1012 offline auxiliary device enables the system to transfer control of the power and duty cycle to a secondary MCU. The control between the system and the load can be more precise and purposefully coupled, through a design that can be simplified, reducing size and cost. The reference design uses a patented isolation technique for isolated feedback."</em> <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/about/news-releases/products/power-control-reference-design-inde-flux">[...]</a>

While glass is a truly ubiquitous material that we use on a daily basis, it also represents a major scientific conundrum. Contrary to what one might expect, the true nature of glass remains something of a mystery, with scientific inquiry into its chemical and physical properties still underway. In chemistry and physics, the term glass itself is a mutable concept: It includes the substance we know as window glass, but it may also refer to a range of other materials with properties that can be explained by reference to glass-like behaviour, including, for instance, metals, plastics, proteins, and even biological cells.

An international team of researchers – from the Universities of Münster, Oxford, Exeter, Pittsburgh, École Polytechnique Fédérale (EPFL) and IBM Research Zurich - has developed a next-generation computer accelerator chip that processes data using light rather than electronics. The results are published in the leading scientific journal Nature on Wednesday, January 6th. Professor C. David Wright of the University of Exeter, who leads the EU project Fun-COMP which funded this work said: “Conventional computer chips are based on electronic data transfer and are comparatively slow, but light-based processors - such as that developed in our work - enable complex mathematical tasks to be processed at speeds hundreds or even thousands of times faster, and with hugely reduced energy consumption.” The team of researchers, led by Prof. Wolfram Pernice from the Institute of Physics and the Center for Soft Nanoscience at the University of Münster, combined integrated photonic devices with phase-change materials (PCMs) to deliver super-fast, energy-efficient matrix-vector (MV) multiplications. MV multiplications lie at the heart of modern computing – from AI to machine learning and neural network processing – and the imperative to carry out such calculations at ever-increasing speeds, but with ever-decreasing energy consumption, is driving the development of a whole new class of processor chips, so-called tensor processing units (TPUs). The team developed a new type of photonic TPU – one capable of carrying out multiple MV multiplications simultaneously and in parallel, using a chip-based frequency comb as a light source, along with wavelength-division-multiplexing."</em> <a href="https://www.exeter.ac.uk/news/homepage/title_832420_en.html">[...]</a>

The engineers also developed a 3D-printed stretchy material that can reveal colors when light changes, according to their study in the journal ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces. Their invention is modeled after the amazing ability of cephalopods such as cuttlefish, octopuses and squids to change the color and texture of their soft skin for camouflage and communication.

<p><em>"Creating a powerful, large-scale quantum computer depends on a clever design such that many qubits (the building block of a quantum computer) can be controlled and read out. Researchers at QuTech, a collaboration between TU Delft and TNO, have invented a new readout method that is an important step forward on the road towards such a large-scale quantum computer. They have published their findings in Nature Communications today. Like toppling dominoes “Our new readout method is based on a phenomenon that all of us know from our childhood: toppling dominoes,” said Sjaak van Diepen, PhD researcher in Lieven Vandersypen’s group and lead author of the article. “A first transition triggers a second transition, a second transition triggers a third transition, and so on – much like dominoes toppling over in a chain reaction.” Considering the implications of this domino-effect led the team to invent a new readout method. It will be able to overcome a major challenge involved in scaling up towards large-scale quantum computers: that of qubit connectivity (the ability to connect many qubits together)."</em> <a href="https://qutech.nl/2021/01/04/reading-out-qubits-like-toppling-dominoes-a-new-scalable-approach-towards-the-quantum-computer/">[...]</a>

The research results show that microfabricated single-crystalline diamond tensile sample can attain a maximum uniform elastic strain of up to 9.7%, which is close to the theoretical elastic deformation limit of diamond. These groundbreaking results were produced by a team co-led by Dr Lu Yang, Associate Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering (MNE) at CityU, in collaboration with experts from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT) and so on. Their findings have been published in the prestigious journal Science under the title “Achieving large uniform tensile elasticity in microfabricated diamond”. With its ultra-high thermal conductivity and exceptional carrier mobility, diamond is not only the hardest material in nature but also a promising electronic material that can tolerate high power and high frequency applications. However, one obstacle to the development of diamond-based electronic and optoelectronic devices is the “doping” challenge caused by the ultra-wide bandgap and its small lattice parameter."</em> <a href="https://www.cityu.edu.hk/media/news/2021/01/04/breakthrough-research-heralds-new-diamond-age">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Sensor developed by SMART researchers would allow rapid diagnosis of nutrition deficiency in plants, enabling farmers to maximize crop yield in a sustainable way. Researchers at the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART) and Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory (TLL) have designed a portable optical sensor that can monitor whether a plant is under stress. The device offers farmers and plant scientists a new tool for early diagnosis and real-time monitoring of plant health in field conditions. Precision agriculture is an important strategy for tackling growing food insecurity through sustainable farming practices, but it requires new technologies for rapid diagnosis of plant stresses before the onset of visible symptoms and subsequent yield loss. SMART’s new portable Raman leaf-clip sensor is a useful tool in precision agriculture allowing early diagnosis of nitrogen deficiency in plants, which can be linked to premature leaf deterioration and loss of yield. In a paper titled “Portable Raman leaf-clip sensor for rapid detection of plant stress,” published in the journal Scientific Reports, the scientists explain how they designed, constructed, and tested the leaf clip that allows the optical sensor to probe the leaf chemistry and establish the stress state."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/portable-device-quickly-detects-plant-stress-0104">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Interface an Arduino Mega with an IDE drive or CF Card! It is easier than you might have thought! The built-in 1 or 4 kilobyte EEPROM memory of an Arduino is quickly used up if you want to permanently store large amounts of data. So it makes sense to connect external mass storage devices in some cases. Fortunately there is already a library and various breakout modules available that allow to connect an SD card to the Arduino. But it is also possible (and not even difficult) to connect CompactFlash and even older hard drives, disk drives or CD- Rom drives to an Arduino Mega."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/michalin70/extend-an-arduino-with-a-cf-card-or-ide-drive-d0a8f8">[...]</a>

<p><em>"As part of the fulfillment of requirements for the Mechatronics class and as MA1 students in electromechanical engineering of the Bruface program, we were tasked with creating a working mechatronic system that incorporates what we learned in theory during lectures, mainly mechanical and electronic design as well as programming. The project was a group assignment and we were a total of four students working on it. We were given access to resources from the Fablab (e.g Laser cutter, 3D printers, and various other tools) and a global budget of 200 euros. The goal of our project is to sort lego blocks based on their color and put them in designated boxes using a gripper system. The lego blocks are fed to the sorting mechanism using a mini conveyor belt equipped with a color sensor that gives the signal to the sorting mechanism to put the block in the adequate box. The system can be divided into three main parts: lego feeding system (conveyor belt), system that drives the vertical and horizontal motion for sorting (cart moving on frame), and the gripper."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Mechatronics-Project-Lego-Sorter/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"While browsing Instructables I came across teebee918's project where he made 2 different types of "motion" sensors. I continued on the principle of one of the sensors. This sensor consists of a spring on which an iron ball is mounted. When this ball moves it hits a conductive ring around the ball, causing the sensor to make contact. The contact time of this sensor is very short. Connecting a lamp or alarm to it to be alerted when the sensor moves is therefore difficult."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Make-a-Vibration-Sensor/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"In this Instructable I show you how to make a simple push to push off circuit with a 555 timer. Because I have come across several projects that use this 555 timer and I had no idea what a 555 timer does exactly, I wanted to make a project to get to know it better. Therefore a simple circuit first. The basic 555 timer gets its name from the fact that there are three internally connected 5k resistors which it uses to generate the two comparators reference voltages. The 555 timer IC is a very cheap, popular and useful precision timing device which can act as either a simple timer to generate single pulses or long time delays, or as a relaxation oscillator producing a string of stabilised waveforms of varying duty cycles from 50 to 100%.The 555 timer chip is extremely robust and stable 8-pin device that can be operated either as a very accurate Monostable, Bistable or Astable Multivibrator to produce a variety of applications such as one-shot or delay timers, pulse generation, LED and lamp flashers, alarms and tone generation, logic clocks, frequency division, power supplies and converters etc, in fact any circuit that requires some form of time control as the list is endless. As I said, I'm going to start simple."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Simple-Touch-on-Touch-Off-Circuit/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"I got my son a tiny whoop indoor FPV drone for Christmas, specifically an EMAX Tinyhawk II. Weve had fun creating small obstacle courses in our basement, but one thing was missing a timer so we could compare flight times. This instructable (my first) is for a drone gate with an automatic timer that can be used at the start and end of the course. When the drone passes through the gate at the start of the course, a timer starts and continues until the drone passes through the gate again at the end of the course. Since were using an Arduino as the brains of this project, we decided to add an RGB LED strip in a circle that the drone flies through. The LEDs change colors every ten seconds during the race that the pilot can see in their peripheral vision."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Tiny-Whoop-Drone-Gate-With-Timer/">[...]</a>
