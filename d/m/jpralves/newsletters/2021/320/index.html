<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1800, o astrónomo irlandês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Parsons,_3rd_Earl_of_Rosse">William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse</a>. Ele construiu o maior telescópio reflector do século XIX. Aprendeu a polir espelhos de metal (1827) e passou os anos seguintes a construir um telescópio de 36 polegadas. Mais tarde, completou um telescópio gigante de 72 polegadas (1845) a que deu o nome de "Leviathan", que permaneceu o maior jamais construído até décadas após a sua morte. Foi o primeiro a resolver a forma espiral dos objectos - anteriormente vistos apenas como nuvens - que muito mais tarde foram identificados como galáxias independentes da nossa própria galáxia Via Láctea e a milhões de anos-luz de distância. O seu primeiro avistamento foi feito em 1845, e em 1850 tinha descoberto mais 13. Em 1848, encontrou e nomeou a Nebulosa de Cancer (porque pensava que se assemelhava a um caranguejo), nome pelo qual ainda é conhecido.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1821, o químico e conferencista inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Henry_Pepper">John Henry Pepper</a>. Ele inventou a ilusão "Pepper's Ghost" utilizada em palco para proporcionar o efeito de um actor que aparece como uma imagem transparente e desaparece no ar. Utilizou uma grande chapa de vidro no palco, inclinada a um ângulo de 45 graus em relação ao chão. A utilização de iluminação especial permitiu ao público ver o reflexo de um actor colocado fora do palco, fora da vista directa do público. Pepper aprendeu pela primeira vez a usar o showmanship para o público no Royal Polytechnic Institution de Londres para apresentar demonstrações experimentais de ritmo rápido e surpreendente para aumentar a compreensão do público dos fenómenos em física e química. Na década de 1870, expandiu as suas actividades a uma audiência global, visitando a Austrália, o Canadá e os Estados Unidos.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1832, o físico e químico inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Crookes">William Crookes</a>. Ele descobriu o elemento tálio e mostrou que os raios catódicos eram partículas em movimento rápido, carregadas negativamente. O espaço escuro Crookes é a região escura em torno de um cátodo que faz descargas eléctricas a baixa pressão. Ele inventou o radiómetro (1875) no qual quatro palhetas suspensas numa agulha no vácuo com um lado preto e o outro branco são observadas a rodar pelo efeito da luz incidente. Inventou também o espintiscópio (1903), que revela partículas alfa emitidas pelo rádio, enquanto a luz pisca quando estas incidem sobre uma tela de sulfureto de zinco vista sob ampliação. Os seus interesses incluíam o espiritualismo, mas forneciam uma orientação mais prática para melhorar o saneamento e os fertilizantes artificiais.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1898, o artista e ilustrador holandês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._C._Escher">M. C. Escher</a>. Ele ficou famoso pelas suas muitas obras de arte moderna com ilusões de perspectiva inventivas e intrincadas pavimentações e inspirações da matemática. A sua arte é apreciada por milhões de pessoas em todo o mundo, como se pode ver nos muitos websites relativos à sua vida e obra. É mais famoso pelas suas construções ditas impossíveis, tais como Ascendente e Descendente, Relatividade assim como as suas Impressões de Transformação, tais como Metamorfose I, II e III, Céu e Água I ou Répteis.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou três astronautas chineses a bordo da nave espacial Shenzhou-12 entraram no módulo central da estação espacial chinesa Tianhe. Depois de Shenzhou-12 ter completado com sucesso um rápido encontro automático e acoplado com o módulo orbital Tianhe, a tripulação de Shenzhou-12 entrou na cápsula orbital a partir da cápsula de retorno da nave espacial.
Após uma série de preparativos, os astronautas abriram as escotilhas do nó e do módulo de Tianhe. Às 18:48, Nie Haisheng, Liu Boming e Tang Hongbo tinham entrado um a um no módulo Tianhe, significando que pela primeira vez os chineses tinham entrado na sua própria estação espacial.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker assim como alguns videos interessantes. É apresentada a revista HackSpaceMag Nº44 de Julho.</p>

<p><em>"The three Chinese astronauts onboard the Shenzhou-12 spaceship entered the country's space station core module Tianhe on Thursday, according to the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA). After Shenzhou-12 successfully completed a fast automated rendezvous and docking with the orbiting Tianhe module, the Shenzhou-12 crew entered the orbital capsule from the return capsule of the spaceship. After a series of preparations, the astronauts opened the hatches of the node and the Tianhe module. By 6:48 p.m., Nie Haisheng, Liu Boming and Tang Hongbo had entered the Tianhe module one by one, signifying that for the first time the Chinese have entered their own space station, said the CMSA. They will carry out relevant work as planned, the CMSA said. "</em> <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-06/17/c_1310013779.htm">[...]</a>

<p><em>"With the establishment of flexible displays behind us, many have asked what the next big development in display technology will be. Recently, free-form displays1 have been gaining traction as next-generation technology that will allow for both high-resolution visuals and portability at the same time. While the technology is still in its nascent stages, significant research has been carried out on stretchable displays (a core technology for free-form displays) that can be stretched in all directions like rubber bands to change their shapes. Stretchable Display and Sensor Breakthroughs On June 4, researchers at the Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT), Samsung’s R&amp;D hub dedicated to cutting-edge future technologies, published research2 in the world-renowned journal ‘Science Advances’ about a technology that overcomes the limitations of stretchable devices. Through this study, stable performance in a stretchable device with high elongation was achieved. This research was also the first in the industry to prove the commercialization potential of stretchable devices, given that the technology is capable of being integrated with existing semiconductor processes."</em> <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-researchers-prove-the-viability-of-commercialized-stretchable-devices">[...]</a>

Microchip Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP) has created a more flexible and cost-effective alternative with the first multiport Power over Ethernet (PoE) power sourcing equipment (PSE) injector, also known as a midspan, that enables any multigigabit switch to support these devices’ high powering needs and data rates, with no network configuration or downtime necessary. “Our new family of multiport, multigigabit PoE PSE Injectors offers the easiest and most cost-effective way to install Wi-Fi 6 devices and small cell equipment,” said Iris Shuker, director of Microchip's PoE business unit. “Patented Microchip technology solves the challenge of powering these devices while also supporting their 10 gigabit-per-second data rates. This greatly simplifies deployment of Wi-Fi 6 APs while enabling service providers, for the first time, to quickly and inexpensively install 5G picocells and femtocells wherever they are needed, which is rarely near an AC outlet.” Multigigabit PoE-enabled switches with sufficient power for Wi-Fi 6 devices and small cell equipment are expensive and not widely adopted. A more cost-effective way to inject power into the network for these high-speed devices is to install one of Microchip’s new multiport, multigigabit midspans between them and any standard multigigabit switch."</em> <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/about/news-releases/products/microchip-simplifies-deployment-of-wi-fi-6-access-points-and--sm">[...]</a>

As the electrification of vehicles progresses, including wider deployment of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), Toshiba and Japan Semiconductor will be able to offer improved LDMOS cell design based on desired voltages. Details of the achievement were reported at the IEEE-sponsored International Symposium on Power Semiconductor Devices and ICs 2021 (ISPSD 2021), held online. There has been a trade-off in LDMOS design between reliability and performance. It is known that tolerance of electrostatic discharge (ESD), as measured using the human body model (HBM), is improved by increasing the backgate ratio*1 to suppress lateral parasitic bipolar action*2, which degrades HBM tolerance.

An international team of astronomers observed the star, VVV-WIT-08, decreasing in brightness by a factor of 30, so that it nearly disappeared from the sky. While many stars change in brightness because they pulsate or are eclipsed by another star in a binary system, it’s exceptionally rare for a star to become fainter over a period of several months and then brighten again. The researchers believe that VVV-WIT-08 may belong to a new class of ‘blinking giant’ binary star system, where a giant star ⎼ 100 times larger than the Sun ⎼ is eclipsed once every few decades by an as-yet unseen orbital companion. The companion, which may be another star or a planet, is surrounded by an opaque disc, which covers the giant star, causing it to disappear and reappear in the sky.

<p><em>"Quantum computers could outperform classical computers at many tasks, but only if the errors that are an inevitable part of computational tasks are isolated rather than widespread events. Now, researchers at the University of Wisconsin–Madison have found evidence that errors are correlated across an entire superconducting quantum computing chip — highlighting a problem that must be acknowledged and addressed in the quest for fault-tolerant quantum computers. The researchers report their findings in a study published June 16 in the journal Nature. Importantly, their work also points to mitigation strategies. “I think people have been approaching the problem of error correction in an overly optimistic way, blindly making the assumption that errors are not correlated,” says UW–Madison physics Professor Robert McDermott, senior author of the study. “Our experiments show absolutely that errors are correlated, but as we identify problems and develop a deep physical understanding, we’re going to find ways to work around them.” The bits in a classical computer can either be a 1 or a 0, but the qubits in a quantum computer can be 1, 0, or an arbitrary mixture — a superposition — of 1 and 0."</em> <a href="https://news.wisc.edu/correlated-errors-in-quantum-computers-emphasize-need-for-design-changes/">[...]</a>

The robots are ‘programmed’ to execute their desired functionalities when magnetic fields are applied. The made-in-NTU robots improve on many existing small-scale robots by optimizing their ability to move in six degrees-of-freedom (DoF) – that is, translational movement along the three spatial axes, and rotational movement about those three axes, commonly known as roll, pitch and yaw angles. While researchers have previously created six DoF miniature robots, the new NTU miniature robots can rotate 43 times faster than them in the critical sixth DoF when their orientation is precisely controlled."</em> <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/news/detail/miniature-robots-controlled-by-magnetic-fields">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Flexible control of the propagating direction of near-field light can be realized with hyperbolic metamaterials, using an all-electric metasource Near-field light is invisible light at the subwavelength scale. Harnessed for a variety of practical applications, such as wireless power transfer, near-field light has an increasingly significant role in the development of miniature on-chip photonic devices. Controlling the direction of near-field light propagation has been an ongoing challenge that is of fundamental interest in photonics physics and can significantly advance a variety of applications. So far, propagation of near-field light in a single direction is achieved by specific interactions between the electric dipole and the magnetic dipole in a system, which has led to inevitable complexities in device design. Hyperbolic metamaterials (HMMs), an important class of artificial anisotropic material with hyperbolic isofrequency contours, have attracted attention due to their unique ability to control near-field light by enabling subwavelength confinement of electromagnetic waves. Large wave-vector modes in HMMs are of particular interest because those modes are easier to integrate and have a smaller loss of energy at transfer."</em> <a href="https://spie.org/news/near-field-routing-of-hyperbolic-metamaterials">[...]</a>

<p><em>"The phenomenon of quantum nonlocality defies our everyday intuition. It shows the strong correlations between several quantum particles some of which change their state instantaneously when the others are measured, regardless of the distance between them. While this phenomenon has been confirmed for slow moving particles, it has been debated whether nonlocality is preserved when particles move very fast at velocities close to the speed of light, and even more so when those velocities are quantum mechanically indefinite. Now, researchers from the University of Vienna, the Austrian Academy of Sciences and the Perimeter Institute report in the latest issue of Physical Review Letters that nonlocality is a universal property of the world, regardless of how and at what speed quantum particles move.

<p><em>"MIT researchers make a major advance toward fully realizing quantum computation. MIT researchers have made a significant advance on the road toward the full realization of quantum computation, demonstrating a technique that eliminates common errors in the most essential operation of quantum algorithms, the two-qubit operation or “gate.” “Despite tremendous progress toward being able to perform computations with low error rates with superconducting quantum bits (qubits), errors in two-qubit gates, one of the building blocks of quantum computation, persist,” says Youngkyu Sung, an MIT graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science who is the lead author of a paper on this topic published today in Physical Review X. “We have demonstrated a way to sharply reduce those errors.” In quantum computers, the processing of information is an extremely delicate process performed by the fragile qubits, which are highly susceptible to decoherence, the loss of their quantum mechanical behavior. In previous research conducted by Sung and the research group he works with, MIT Engineering Quantum Systems, tunable couplers were proposed, allowing researchers to turn two-qubit interactions on and off to control their operations while preserving the fragile qubits. The tunable coupler idea represented a significant advance and was cited, for example, by Google as being key to their recent demonstration of the advantage that quantum computing holds over classical computing. Still, addressing error mechanisms is like peeling an onion: Peeling one layer reveals the next."</em> <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/clearing-way-toward-robust-quantum-computing-0616">[...]</a>

<p><em>"There have been quite a few nice power supply projects based around the XL4015 buck converter module. It is a great module for this type of project as it has a wide range of voltage output and decent current capability. It is also available with modules that give multi-turn potentiometer setting of the voltage and extra circuitry to allow for an adjustable current limit. The difference with this instructable is that I have made it digitally controlled on both the voltage and current limit settings and provide for measurement and display of the voltage and actual current being drawn. The controller used is an ESP8266 module which means it also gets a web interface and opens up more possibilities for control. This gives it the following features: - Output voltage digitally settable between 1.25 and 19.0V - Current output up to 5A (4A more realistic to avoid thermal shutdown)."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/DIgital-Controlled-Bench-Power-Supply/">[...]</a>

I wanted to build something with an arduino since I have received and completed an "arduino starter kit". Therefore, this project is my first attempt at building something with an arduino (and electronics) and I have done a lot of mistakes along the way. This is far from being perfect and I can't guaranty it will work out if you try this yourself. I have written down all the mistakes I have done so you could avoid them. English is not my native language, sorry for potential grammatical or syntactic errors."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/yoann-_-/automatic-solar-powered-chicken-door-bddc82">[...]</a>

I tried my best to document this project to you, to look simple. so you can also make this project as I do, if you appreciate my work, a sub to my youtube channelwill make me happy and keeps me motivated so I can make new projects for you in the near future, so with out further ado lets get started........"</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/noneedforit/how-to-use-lora-with-arduino-22aafc">[...]</a>

<p><em>"A neo-pixel displaying the among us character which I then attached to a backpack. Goal/ Requirements While making the Among Us backpack there were a couple goals that had to be met, including: It had to be light enough for me to carry it on my back It had to be able to fit on my backpack It had to be bright enough to be seen even in the day It had to have a power source that was both portable and able to produce enough volts and amps to meet the second requirement (about 5V 1A) The project had to be able to run for long amounts of time without overheating The project had to display the lights in a way so that it was easy to recognize it as the among us character. Before starting the project in person, I originally used tinkercad in order to make my first prototypes. Initially I made the project on an 8 by 8 grid, however this broke my last requirement as the character was very short and distorted. I also made a blue background which made it even harder to see. I compromised for this by making my second draft without the background and on a 12 by 12 grid, however after measuring the bag I planned on using I realized this broke my second requirement as the grid was too fat to fit on my bag."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/tglizzy/among-us-backpack-75af0f">[...]</a>

<p><em>"One year ago I posted the following two articles: Arduino Tone Generator Arduino Note Generator Shortly followed by an associated video on YouTube and so the Simple DIY Electronic Music Projects blog was born! They were then followed by the Arduino MIDI Tone Module and many others since. So in honour of my one-year anniversary, after more than 180 posts, including the launch of the Lo-Fi Orchestra, I wanted to return to those “tone” roots and do something slightly different. Here are twelve Arduino Nanos, each with a speaker and armed with nothing more than the MIDI library and the tone() function bringing you my favourite selection of music from the whole of the Star Wars saga – the fanfare from the last scenes of Star Wars Episode IV A New Hope.

It provides 4 graphic overlay layers with transparency, nearly 30 frame buffer formats that can be freely combined with each other, making do with limited RAM memory size. The limitation of output to 8 bits also contributes to RAM saving. The RP2040 processor contains 264 KB of RAM. This is not much for higher resolution image output and therefore RAM needs to be very sparing.

<p><em>"Automatic irrigation of 3 plants of Pothos, through the use of Wemos (ESP8266). The project aimed to wet the plants of Epipremnum aureum, commonly known as Pothos or Scindapsus aureus. These plants are found in the Prototyping laboratory of school "G.Vallauri" in Fossano and they are positioned near the ProtoMAX water jet machine. The purpose of this experience is precisely to water the plants by using the water used by the water jet machine. This appliance, during its processing, expels the water used outside; this water, after being suitably filtered, is conveyed into a bucket where there is a pump that will start to wet the 3 plants. In addition, the work required is to use the Blink software and Telegram to be able to control and if necessary also manually operate the system and the detectic data."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/Leonardo_02/smart-irrigation-01a760">[...]</a>
