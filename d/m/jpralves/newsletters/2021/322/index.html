<p>Faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1646, o filósofo e matemático alemão <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz">Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz</a>. Ele foi importante tanto como metafísico como lógico, e também distinguido pela sua invenção independente do cálculo diferencial e integral. Através de encontros com estudiosos como Christiaan Huygens em Paris e com membros da Royal Society, incluindo Robert Boyle, durante duas viagens a Londres em 1673 e 1676, Leibniz foi apresentado aos problemas pendentes que desafiam os matemáticos e físicos da Europa. Ele descobriu independentemente o cálculo diferencial e integral (publicado em 1684), mas envolveu-se numa amarga disputa prioritária com Isaac Newton, cujas ideias sobre o cálculo foram desenvolvidas mais cedo (1665), mas publicadas mais tarde (1687).</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1788, o matemático e engenheiro francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Victor_Poncelet">Jean-Victor Poncelet</a>. Ele estudou o pólo e as linhas polares associadas à cónica que levaram ao princípio da dualidade. Em 1822 publicou Traité des propriétés projectives des figures em que apresentou as suas ideias fundamentais de geometria projectiva tais como a relação cruzada, perspectiva, involução e os pontos circulares ao infinito. Como professor de mecânica (1825-35), aplicou a mecânica para melhorar as rodas de água e foi capaz de duplicar a sua eficiência.</p>

<p>Faz igualmente hoje anos que nascia, em 1872, o engenheiro eléctrico inglês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Duddell">William Du Bois Duddell</a>. Ele inventou o oscilógrafo de bobina móvel sensível capaz de registar fotograficamente um ponto de luz que traça as oscilações de uma tensão eléctrica, e outros instrumentos eléctricos. Ele concebeu o que pode ser considerado como o primeiro instrumento musical eléctrico, o Arco Cantante (1899), com base nos sons emitidos por uma lâmpada eléctrica de arco de carbono quando a sua tensão de alimentação era variada. Foi um resultado da sua investigação para resolver o problema dos ruídos indesejáveis de zumbido gerado pela iluminação de rua em arco de carbono. Esta investigação descobriu um princípio associado de resistência negativa. As frequências de áudio foram geradas pela comutação de circuitos ressonantes adequados para o arco.</p>

<p>Faz também hoje anos que nascia, em 1906, o matemático francês <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Dieudonn%C3%A9">Jean Dieudonné</a>. Ele ficou conhecido pelos seus escritos sobre álgebra abstracta, análise funcional, topologia, e a sua teoria dos grupos de Lie. Dieudonné foi um dos dois principais contribuintes para a série de textos Bourbaki. Começou a sua carreira matemática trabalhando na análise de polinómios. Trabalhou numa grande variedade de áreas matemáticas incluindo topologia geral, espaços vectoriais topológicos, geometria algébrica, teoria invariável e os grupos clássicos.</p>

<p>Por fim, faz hoje anos que nascia, em 1956, o bioquímico, geneticista e oncologista americano <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_L._Semenza">Gregg L. Semenza</a>. Ele partilhou o Prémio Nobel da Medicina de 2019 com William G. Kaelin Jr. e Peter J. Ratcliffe, pelo seu trabalho sobre como as células se sentem e se adaptam à disponibilidade de oxigénio. Semenza fez a descoberta pioneira do HIF-1 (factor induzível de hipoxia 1), uma proteína, que controla os genes em resposta a mudanças na disponibilidade de oxigénio, e ajusta a quantidade de oxigénio que é recebida pelas células. Esta linha de investigação tem implicações de grande alcance no tratamento de várias doenças, incluindo cancro, ataques cardíacos, anemia e acidentes vasculares cerebrais. Por exemplo, podem ser feitos mais estudos para examinar se as células cancerosas estão à procura de oxigénio quando se espalham pelos tecidos circundantes e pela corrente sanguínea que as transporta pelo corpo.</p>

<p>Faz hoje trinta anos que foi feita a primeira chamada oficial GSM entre o antigo primeiro-ministro finlandês Harri Holkeri e o vice-presidente de Tampere Kaarina Suonio, a 1 de Julho de 1991, durou pouco mais de três minutos. A Nokia desenvolveu durante dois intensos anos a tecnologia que viria a permitir este feito.</p>

<p>O rádio transístor foi uma maravilha tecnológica que colocou a música literalmente nas mãos dos consumidores em meados da década de 1950. Era barato, fiável e portátil, mas nunca conseguia sequer aproximar a qualidade sonora de um disco a ser tocado numa aparelhagem doméstica. Era, no entanto, a única tecnologia disponível para os amantes de música em movimento até que a Sony Corporation desencadeou uma revolução na electrónica pessoal com a introdução do primeiro leitor de cassetes estéreo pessoal. Um aparelho tão espantoso no primeiro encontro como o telemóvel ou câmara digital seria mais tarde, o Sony Walkman foi posto à venda pela primeira vez em 1 de Julho de 1979.</p>

<p>Nesta semana que passou foi lançado o Kernel de Linux 5.13. As principais novidades são o suporte inicial para o Apple M1, suporte preliminar para a placa gráfica integrada no CPU Intel Alder Lake S, suporte para o HDMI adaptativo das GPUs da AMD, um novo driver genérico USB, suporte bastante melhor da arquitectura RISC-V. Tratou-se de um dos maiores lançamentos com cerca de 17 mil alterações.</p>

<p>Também nesta semana que passou a Klein Vision fez uma demonstração das capacidades do seu prototipo do AirCar, um carro voador, fazendo uma viagem de cerca de 35 minutos entre duas cidades da Eslováquia. O veiculo voa a uma velocidade de cruzeiro de 190 km/h e a uma altitude de cerca de 2500 metros. É objectivo da companhia desenvolver um novo prototipo que consiga atingir velocidades de cruzeiro de cerca de 300 km/h e ter uma autonomia de cerca de 1000 quilómetros sem reabastecimentos.</p>

<p>Na Newsletter desta semana apresentamos diversas noticias, artigos científicos, projetos de maker assim como alguns videos interessantes.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.klein-vision.com/press">﻿The flying car completes first ever inter-city flight</a></h2>

<p><em>"AirCar, a dual-mode car-aircraft vehicle moved closer to production this week, fulfilling a key development milestone in a 35-minute flight from the international airport in Nitra to the international airport in Bratislava on June 28th, 2021. Klein Vision’s patent protected AirCar completed its 142nd successful landing in Bratislava at 6:05AM. After landing, at a click of a button the aircraft transformed into a sports car in under three minutes and was driven by its inventor, Professor Stefan Klein and co-founder, Anton Zajac to downtown Bratislava, cutting the typical travel time by a factor of two. “Professor Stefan Klein is the world leader in the development of user-friendly Flying Cars.” said Dr. Branko Sarh, Boeing Co. Senior Technical Fellow. “The automated transition from road vehicle into an air vehicle and vice versa, deploying/retracting wings and tail is not only the result of pioneering enthusiasm, innovative spirit and courage; it is an outcome of excellent engineering and professional knowledge,” he added. The AirCar Prototype 1 is equipped with a 160HP BMW engine with fixed-propeller and a ballistic parachute."</em> <a href="https://www.klein-vision.com/press">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Virgin Orbit now has two successful launches under its belt. The company lofted seven satellites today (June 30), taking a big step toward regular and reliable commercial launch service. Virgin Orbit's carrier plane, a modified Boeing 747 called Cosmic Girl, took off from California's Mojave Air and Space Port today around 9:50 a.m. EDT (1350 GMT; 6:50 a.m. local time) with the two-stage LauncherOne rocket under its wing. At 10:47 a.m. EDT (1447 GMT; 7:47 a.m. local California time), Cosmic Girl dropped LauncherOne over the designated launch zone — a patch of the Pacific Ocean near the Channel Islands — and the rocket roared to life, carrying the spacecraft into the final frontier. Nearly two hours later, Virgin Orbit confirmed that all seven payloads had been deployed as planned into their target orbits. Virgin Orbit, part of Richard Branson's Virgin Group of companies, called today's mission "Tubular Bells: Part One.""</em> <a href="https://www.space.com/virgin-orbit-launch-seven-satellies">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Designed to improve navigation for robotic explorers and the operation of GPS satellites, the technology demonstration reports a significant milestone. Spacecraft that venture beyond our Moon rely on communication with ground stations on Earth to figure out where they are and where they’re going. NASA’s Deep Space Atomic Clock is working toward giving those far-flung explorers more autonomy when navigating. In a new paper published today in the journal Nature, the mission reports progress in their work to improve the ability of space-based atomic clocks to measure time consistently over long periods. Known as stability, this feature also impacts the operation of GPS satellites that help people navigate on Earth, so this work also has the potential to increase the autonomy of next-generation GPS spacecraft. To calculate the trajectory of a distant spacecraft, engineers send signals from the spacecraft to Earth and back."</em> <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/deep-space-atomic-clock-moves-toward-increased-spacecraft-autonomy">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Ever wondered how Mars rovers take a selfie? Color video from NASA’s Perseverance shows how the rover captured the historic April 6, 2021, image of itself beside the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter. As a bonus, the rover’s entry, descent, and landing microphone captured the sound of the arm’s motors whirring during the process. Selfies allow engineers to check wear and tear on the rover. But they also inspire a new generation of space enthusiasts: Many rover team members can cite a favorite image that sparked their interest in NASA. “I got into this because I saw a picture from Sojourner, NASA’s first Mars rover,” said Vandi Verma, Perseverance’s chief engineer for robotic operations at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California."</em> <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8974/watch-and-hear-how-nasas-perseverance-rover-took-its-first-selfie/">[...]</a>

<h2><a href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/about/blog/new-products-and-tools/microchip-is-first-to-achieve-jedec-qualification-for-a-radiatio">Microchip is First to Achieve JEDEC Qualification for a Radiation-Tolerant (RT) FPGA in a Plastic Package</a></h2>

<p><em>"Low-power RTG4 FPGA offers new space system designers the industry’s highest reliability at lowest cost with shortest lead times Developers of small-satellite constellations and other systems used in New Space missions must deliver both high reliability and radiation protection while meeting stringent cost and scheduling requirements. Microchip Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP) has now given them a faster, more economical production path with the first Radiation Tolerant (RT) FPGA that offers the low cost of a JEDEC-qualified plastic package plus the proven reliability of RTG4™ FPGA technology and decades of spaceflight heritage so they do not need to be screened to full Qualified Manufacturers List (QML) procedures. “This is a major milestone for system designers who need large volumes of space-grade components at low unit cost and reduced lead times so they can keep pace with shorter service launch cycles,” said Ken O’Neill, associate director, space and aviation marketing for Microchip’s FPGA business unit. “These RTG4 FPGAs have very high standards for reliability and radiation protection, while keeping the cost down using plastic packages and Sub-QML screening.” Microchip’s RTG4 Sub-QML FPGA has been qualified to JEDEC standards in a flip-chip 1657 ball grid array (BGA) plastic package, with 1.0 mm ball pitch. It is pin compatible with the company’s QML Class V-qualified RTG4 FPGAs in ceramic packages, making it easy for developers to migrate their designs between New Space and more rigorous Class-1 missions. The RTG4 Sub-QML FPGAs in plastic packages are also available as prototypes in small quantities, allowing designers to evaluate the product and prototype their systems before committing to large volumes of flight models."</em> <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/about/blog/new-products-and-tools/microchip-is-first-to-achieve-jedec-qualification-for-a-radiatio">[...]</a>

Methane could have nothing to do with microbes or any other biology, however; geological processes that involve the interaction of rocks, water, and heat can also produce it.

<p><em>"The first commercially scalable integrated laser and microcomb on a single chip Fifteen years ago, UC Santa Barbara electrical and materials professor John Bowers pioneered a method for integrating a laser onto a silicon wafer. The technology has since been widely deployed in combination with other silicon photonics devices to replace the copper-wire interconnects that formerly linked servers at data centers, dramatically increasing energy efficiency — an important endeavor at a time when data traffic is growing by roughly 25% per year. For several years, the Bowers group has collaborated with the group of Tobias J. Kippenberg at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL), within the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Direct On-Chip Digital Optical Synthesizer (DODOS) program. The Kippenberg group discovered “microcombs,” a series of parallel, low-noise, highly stable laser lines. Each of the many lines of the laser comb can carry information, extensively multiplying the amount of data that can be sent by a single laser. Recently, several teams demonstrated very compact combs by placing a semiconductor laser chip and a separate silicon nitride ring-resonator chip very close together."</em> <a href="https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2021/020346/laser-breakthrough">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Natural wood remains a ubiquitous building material because of its high strength-to-density ratio; trees are strong enough to grow hundreds of feet tall but remain light enough to float down a river after being logged. For the past three years, engineers at the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Engineering and Applied Science have been developing a type of material they’ve dubbed “metallic wood.” Their material gets its useful properties and name from a key structural feature of its natural counterpart: porosity. As a lattice of nanoscale nickel struts, metallic wood is full of regularly spaced cell-sized pores that radically decrease its density without sacrificing the material’s strength. The precise spacing of these gaps not only gives metallic wood the strength of titanium at a fraction of the weight, but unique optical properties. Because the spaces between gaps are the same size as the wavelengths of visible light, the light reflecting off of metallic wood interferes to enhance specific colors. The enhanced color changes are based on the angle that light reflects off of the surface, giving it a dazzling appearance and the potential to be used as a sensor."</em> <a href="https://blog.seas.upenn.edu/growing-metallic-wood-to-new-heights/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Study marks major step to creating a system to study quantum phase transitions In 1934, physicist Eugene Wigner made a theoretical prediction based on quantum mechanics that for decades years went unseen. The theory suggested how a metal that normally conducts electricity could turn into a nonconducting insulator when the density of electrons is reduced. Wigner theorized that when electrons in metals are brought to ultracold temperatures, these electrons would be frozen in their tracks and form a rigid, non-electricity conducting structure — a crystal — instead of zipping around at thousands of kilometers per second and creating an electric current. Since he discovered it, the structure was coined a Wigner crystal and was observed for the first time in 1979. What’s remained stubbornly elusive to physicists, however, has been the melting of the crystal state into a liquid in response to quantum fluctuations. At least, it was: Now, almost 90 years later, a team of physicists co-led by Hongkun Park and Eugene Demler in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences has finally experimentally documented this transition."</em> <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2021/06/study-marks-major-step-to-creating-a-system-to-study-quantum-phase-transitions/">[...]</a>

In the Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy, by AIP Publishing, researchers from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign show that by designing controllers based on viewing the wind farm system as a coupled network, it is possible to extract power more efficiently. “If you think of a wind farm as a group of turbines each vying for the incoming wind, if every turbine is greedy and tries to maximize its own power, the system as a whole is suboptimal,” said author Lucas Buccafusca. “Our work seeks to design controls for turbines to work collectively, thereby improving performance.” The researchers apply a model predictive control (MPC) framework for varying wind velocities and incorporate wake steering techniques to demonstrate there can be a potential benefit to incorporating these methods into future wind turbine control algorithms."</em> <a href="https://publishing.aip.org/publications/latest-content/steering-wind-turbines-creates-greater-energy-potential/">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Counting can be a fun task for young children. Children as young as two may start saying numbers in no particular order. A lot of parents start teaching their kids numbers by counting objects around their home. For example, snacks could be counted as the child eats them or toy cars on the floor could be counted as there are put away for the day. Eventually children will learn to equate the number symbol (1 10) with the number of objects that are counted. In this project, it will be the number of green lights that light up."</em> <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Based-Counting-Tree-for-Children/">[...]</a>

On this deliberately minimalist site, you will find Arduino libraries &amp; programs which will also allow you to run ZARDOS on your Minitel. The basic principle is simple: The Arduino communicates with the Minitel via the serial link of the peri-computer cable. In one direction it retrieves information from the keyboard, and in the other it sends its configuration commands and screen display. All made possible thanks to the brilliant library written by Eric Serandour The basic program runs on an Arduino MEGA, but it is possible to run a minimum version on UNO."</em> <a href="http://zardos.fr/">[...]</a>

Introduction This 12V uninterruptible power supply initially designs to drive my fiber optic modem/router. The key reason to build this power supply is to get continuous internet and phone connection during power failures. Core components of this power supply are a constant voltage charger, 12V DC power supply, AC line monitoring unit, and 12V high capacity sealed lead-acid battery."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/dilshan-jayakody/12v-uninterruptible-power-supply-1dae1e">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Low power('ish) AIoT smart camera (3D printed) based on the Raspberry Pi Zero W and Google Coral EdgeTPU https://github.com/ricardodeazambuja/Maple-Syrup-Pi-Camera People ask me the reason I chose to use the Raspberry Pi Zero for this project considering it's not a powerful single-board computer. I could have tried ready-made smart cameras, but the Raspberry Pi is one of the best selling general purpose computers ever (beating the Commodore 64, numbers from 4 years ago! ), therefore it has a huge community. This makes life much easier when you need to find a driver or how to solve a problem. In addition to that, last year I released my work on a flexible, collision resilient, quadcopter that has as its brain... a Raspberry Pi Zero W! So, I'm quite familiar working with the Zero and I hope the Raspberry Pi Foundation will soon come up with an upgrade (maybe adding a RP2040 to the RPI Zero PCB?)."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/ricardodeazambuja/maple-syrup-pi-camera-7962d9">[...]</a>

<p><em>"Monitoring basement to make sure humidity does not rise too high and alert to check if dehumidifier bucket is full. Motivation I live in East Coast of USA where most of the houses have basements, some are finished, some are not. Our basement is semi-finished which means proper dehumidification is not setup. In non-finished basements we need to make sure humidity does not rise too much for a long period of time which helps molds to grow. Toxic mold can irritate your eyes, your respiratory system and cause very unpleasant odors in your basement. Mold can trigger asthma attacks and cause serious problems for individuals who have weakened immune systems."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/mithun-das/basement-monitoring-using-wio-terminal-and-blynk-6d8ae6">[...]</a>

<p><em>"GuitArnet is an Arduino-based simple MIDI guitar with pitch, power chords and minor pentatonic connected to Ableton Live through MIDI. I’ve canceled my Internet service and the local company, named Arnet, left a cable modem router behind. I’ve thought about the trash but then I’ve decided to create a small MIDI instrument just because I was able to add “GUIT” to the Internet provider printed in the case and form GuitARNET. Yes. Really. All the electronics were removed and I’ve added an Arduino Nano connected to a distance sensor, a joystick, 2 potentiometers and 2 Leds."</em> <a href="https://www.hackster.io/roni-bandini/modem-turned-into-a-midi-guitar-sort-of-guitarnet-c98fb9">[...]</a>

<p><em>"I’m preparing a video where I show you how to make the PCB design and order the panel version for your board and then solder all components at once. In that way you can save time and finish your product faster so they will be ready for sale. To do that I need a reflow hot plate and that’s what we will build today using a second-hand clothes iron. We need to measure the temperature, show the power and that temperature on a screen so the user could see the values, we need to control power and in this case a lot of power because my iron is of 3000W, and then we need to have some sort of menu or control in order to select the settings. Let me show you what parts we need, the connections I will do, how to measure and control the temperature at high power and also show you the code. Finally, let’s see if this homemade reflow hot plate will work and if I can reach the desired temperature curve, so what do you think, will it work?"</em> <a href="https://electronoobs.com/eng_arduino_tut155.php">[...]</a>
