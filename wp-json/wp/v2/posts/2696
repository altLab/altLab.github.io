Shi\u00addo Naka\u00admu\u00adra was the final selec\u00adti\u00adon. Fili\u00adpe had some night\u00adma\u00adres about for\u00adget\u00adting what to say live on sta\u00adge and screwing up the Japa\u00adne\u00adse accent. Tia\u00adgo Ror\u00adke ended up wor\u00adking another all nigh\u00adter doing some video edi\u00adting and drawing a 2d taco for the presentation.<\/p>\n<p>By the way, the music we used for the final part is&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.newgrounds.com\/audio\/listen\/245921\">ParagonX9 \u2014 Cha\u00adoz Air\u00adflow<\/a>, avai\u00adla\u00adble under a Cre\u00ada\u00adti\u00adve Com\u00admons by-nc-sa licen\u00adse. And the short clip of Japa\u00adne\u00adse crowd che\u00ade\u00adring was snip\u00adped from a ran\u00addom you\u00adtu\u00adbe video of a ran\u00addom Japa\u00adne\u00adse gameshow whi\u00adch we can\u2019t find anymore.<\/p>\n<h3>Saturday<\/h3>\n<p>We all woke up later then plan\u00adned and fee\u00adling somewhat sick and tired of wor\u00adking on the pro\u00adject. But one final effort was still nee\u00added, the pre\u00adsen\u00adta\u00adti\u00adon had to be perfect!<\/p>\n<p>We did a few ite\u00adra\u00adti\u00adons of the final chal\u00adlen\u00adge video, adding sound effects and tes\u00adting the length. The story\u00adbo\u00adard still suf\u00adfe\u00adred a few small chan\u00adges to cre\u00ada\u00adte big\u00adger cres\u00adcen\u00addo impact. Last minu\u00adte over\u00adlay graphics of the sen\u00adsors were desig\u00adned by Tia\u00adgo Far\u00adto and quic\u00adkly inserted.<\/p>\n<p>Test on the sta\u00adge pro\u00adved the face\u00adtrac\u00adking could work without addi\u00adti\u00ado\u00adnal ligh\u00adting. Everything see\u00admed more or less ready. Just one more ren\u00adder of the final video with some more small impor\u00adtant chan\u00adges required.<\/p>\n<p>Pre\u00adsen\u00adta\u00adti\u00adon had some glit\u00adches but went rather well. The crowd mana\u00adged to get into it and that was reflec\u00adted hea\u00advily on the voting. Gre\u00adat posi\u00adti\u00adve reac\u00adti\u00adons both in per\u00adson and through the twit\u00adter feed. We were very ple\u00ada\u00adsed and loo\u00adking forward to the pri\u00adze giving. Tia\u00adgo Far\u00adto had to lea\u00adve early and Ferd never mana\u00adged to come back to Code\u00adbits sin\u00adce Thurs\u00adday, so we were left only 3 of us, Mau\u00adri\u00adcio Mar\u00adtins, Fili\u00adpe Cruz and Tia\u00adgo Ror\u00adke to col\u00adlect the prizes!<\/p>\n<p>We won the 1st pla\u00adce public award and offe\u00adred the sen\u00adsor hel\u00admet devi\u00adce to the Code\u00adbits orga\u00adni\u00adzers infor\u00adming them that all the peo\u00adple invol\u00adved with orga\u00adni\u00adzing the Nucle\u00adar Taco Chal\u00adlen\u00adge had to take pic\u00adtu\u00adres of them\u00adselfs wea\u00adring the hel\u00admet and uplo\u00adad them to the internet.<\/p>\n<h1>Conclusions<\/h1>\n<p>Domo Ari\u00adga\u00adto to everyo\u00adne for your feed\u00adback and sup\u00adport.
