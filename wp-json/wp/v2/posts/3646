Yes, you, dear nerd who are thin\u00adking of atten\u00adding Code\u00adbits this&nbsp;year.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"dquo\">\u201c<\/span>And why is that?\u201d i hear you ask. Couz we pwned you hard last year with our <a href=\"http:\/\/audienciazero.net\/xda\/2011\/11\/21\/nuclear-taco-sensor-helmet-gameshow-codebits-2011\/\">Nucle\u00adar Taco Sen\u00adsor Hel\u00admet Gameshow<\/a> pro\u00adject. That\u2019s why! Our pwna\u00adge didn\u2019t hap\u00adpen out of the blue you know? We care\u00adfully plan\u00adned this world domi\u00adna\u00adti\u00adon and had to car\u00adry it through nice and ste\u00adady to make sure we inde\u00aded had something grand we could put together in 48 hours and take the com\u00adpe\u00adti\u00adti\u00adon by storm. And unless you\u2019d rather sit at home and cry your\u00adself to sle\u00adep for another year you should be get\u00adting off your ass, right about yes\u00adter\u00adday, and also get\u00adting ready for this years&nbsp;event!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/altlab.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/11\/CodebitsV.jpg\" alt width=\"500\" height=\"375\"><\/p>\n<p>We know, we know, our unsur\u00admoun\u00adta\u00adble talent is qui\u00adte hard to beat. But even if you\u2019re too sca\u00adred of get\u00adting your ass ser\u00adved again, you should be using this time to come up with cool pro\u00adjects you could develop.<\/p>\n<p>Com\u00admon mis\u00adta\u00adkes you should be avoiding:<\/p>\n<p>a) doing yet another clo\u00adne of something (without a sub\u00adver\u00adsi\u00adve twist). Simp\u00adsons did it, if you can\u2019t impro\u00adve on an old idea you shouldn\u2019t be tou\u00adching&nbsp;it.<\/p>\n<p>b) doing an hel\u00adlo world of a ran\u00addom new tech\u00adno\u00adlogy. Unless it\u2019s taking full advan\u00adta\u00adge of the tech on a use\u00adful way, it\u2019s dead fish in the&nbsp;water.<\/p>\n<p>c) trying to be funny without the tech to back it up. You\u2019ll get enter\u00adtain\u00adment votes but unless it\u2019s something over the top it\u2019ll be just&nbsp;sad.<\/p>\n<p>And in case you haven\u2019t noti\u00adced just having a good pro\u00adject idea isn\u2019t enough, you need to finish it and pre\u00adsent it in an enga\u00adging way. Our public award win\u00adner entry is a good exam\u00adple on how a wtf pre\u00adsen\u00adta\u00adti\u00adon trumps over pro\u00adject specs. Peo\u00adple are more enga\u00adged when you _show_ them things ins\u00adte\u00adad of _describing_ them.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m not saying you should turn your pre\u00adsen\u00adta\u00adti\u00adons into a cir\u00adcus, it wor\u00adked well for us last year becau\u00adse no one was expec\u00adting something so over the top. What you should aim for is to have a good use\u00adful idea and pre\u00adpa\u00adre an enga\u00adging demons\u00adtra\u00adti\u00adon. Show awe\u00adso\u00adme\u00adness first, explain imple\u00admen\u00adta\u00adti\u00adon details later. And don\u2019t for\u00adget that during tho\u00adse 48 hours that you are sup\u00adpo\u00adsed to put your pro\u00adject together you will be get\u00adting dis\u00adtrac\u00adted by 4 tracks of tech talks whi\u00adch you may or may not cho\u00ado\u00adse to attend. And i also heard eating and sle\u00ade\u00adping are impor\u00adtant. So don\u2019t aim for something unat\u00adtai\u00adna\u00adble, or if you must, at least mas\u00adter your wea\u00adpon of choi\u00adce befo\u00adre the event, to make sure the actu\u00adal 48h deve\u00adlop\u00adment peri\u00adod goes smo\u00adother. Sur\u00adroun\u00adding your\u00adself with folks who com\u00adple\u00adment your skills nicely is also a key fac\u00adtor, don\u2019t neglect it.<\/p>\n<p>Ofcour\u00adse all of the abo\u00adve is use\u00adless if you don\u2019t get your\u00adself selec\u00adted to attend the event. Code\u00adbits is limi\u00adted to 600 atten\u00adde\u00ades and if you want to be one of them you need to start buil\u00adding up your kar\u00adma by par\u00adti\u00adci\u00adpa\u00adting acti\u00advely in the <a href=\"http:\/\/codebits.eu\">code\u00adbits web\u00adsi\u00adte<\/a> and forwar\u00adding the infor\u00adma\u00adti\u00adon to your blog, twit\u00adter and face\u00adbo\u00adok con\u00adtacts. A sure way to get admit\u00adted is to give a talk at the event, the\u00adre will be a call ope\u00adning soon to sub\u00admit your talks. So if the\u00adre is a tech\u00adno\u00adlogy you have been busy mas\u00adte\u00adring for the last few months you might want to con\u00adsi\u00adder sub\u00admit\u00adting a talk about it when the call&nbsp;opens.<\/p>\n<p>And why should you care about atten\u00adding code\u00adbits at all? Well, even if your pro\u00adject fails to win anything you\u2019ll still:<\/p>\n<p>a) get some prac\u00adti\u00adce with the tech\u00adno\u00adlogy you cho\u00adse to explore<\/p>\n<p>b) learn a lot from the talks pre\u00adsen\u00adted you bothe\u00adred atten\u00adding or chec\u00adked the vide\u00ados&nbsp;after<\/p>\n<p>c) check what everyo\u00adne else is up&nbsp;to<\/p>\n<p>d) have some unres\u00adtrai\u00adned chats with other ran\u00addom nerds on the food&nbsp;queue<\/p>\n<p>e) face the pos\u00adsi\u00adbi\u00adlity of a near death expe\u00adri\u00aden\u00adce by nucle\u00adar&nbsp;taco<\/p>\n<p>f) have fun geek\u2019ing out<\/p>\n<p>g) get an awe\u00adso\u00adme t\u2011shirt!<\/p>\n<p>I have atten\u00added the last 3 edi\u00adti\u00adons of Code\u00adbits and i can tell you i lear\u00adned new things in all of them. The\u00adre is always something new out the\u00adre worth chec\u00adking out or new peo\u00adple to meet. I had a blast with fri\u00adends, wat\u00adched some nice gigs, sha\u00adred my kno\u00adwled\u00adge with fel\u00adlow geeks and even mana\u00adged to win some poofs and badges!<\/p>\n<p>Every year we setup a small cor\u00adner for the Audi\u00ad\u00ean\u00adcia Zero labs, the\u00adre we gather the folks from our 3 media hac\u00adklabs, <span class=\"caps\">LCD<\/span> from Porto\/Guimar\u00e3es, altLab from Lis\u00adbon and xDA from Coim\u00adbra.
