One of her friend\u2019s fathers, when her fri\u00adend was a kid, built a vehi\u00adcle out of a bicy\u00adcle and washing machi\u00adne, becau\u00adse the family couldn\u2019t afford a car. Cul\u00adtu\u00adrally, we used to know how to make and fix everything. As the 20th cen\u00adtury pro\u00adgres\u00adsed, we lost that abi\u00adlity, but thanks to the maker com\u00admu\u00adnity, we are slo\u00adwly get\u00adting it back. By fos\u00adte\u00adring the deve\u00adlop\u00adment and inven\u00adti\u00adon of new smart mate\u00adri\u00adals, Cata\u00adri\u00adna hopes to help makers rea\u00adch the next&nbsp;level.<\/p>\n<p>What are smart mate\u00adri\u00adals? Fun\u00adda\u00admen\u00adtally, they\u2019re mate\u00adri\u00adals we are alre\u00adady incre\u00addi\u00adbly fami\u00adli\u00adar with like paint, paper and plas\u00adtic. The trick is, all of the\u00adse mate\u00adri\u00adals now come with a twist. Paint and ink, for exam\u00adple, can now con\u00adduct elec\u00adtri\u00adcity such that peo\u00adple are able to paint cir\u00adcuits with a brush or, with the addi\u00adti\u00adon of a mag\u00adnet, make a spe\u00ada\u00adker out of a she\u00adet of paper. Acry\u00adlic, a type of plas\u00adtic, can now be infu\u00adsed with light dif\u00adfu\u00adsing par\u00adti\u00adcles so light can reflect through its enti\u00adre sur\u00adfa\u00adce ins\u00adte\u00adad of just the edges. What this means prac\u00adti\u00adcally is, by flip\u00adping a light swit\u00adch, you can turn your win\u00addows from see-through to opa\u00adque. Ther\u00admo\u00adch\u00adro\u00admic pig\u00adments can be added to plas\u00adtics so you can see when your baby\u2019s bot\u00adtle is hot. Pos\u00adsi\u00adbi\u00adli\u00adti\u00ades are beco\u00adming endless.<\/p>\n<p>Howe\u00adver, in order to har\u00adness the full poten\u00adti\u00adal of the\u00adse mate\u00adri\u00adals, Cata\u00adri\u00adna beli\u00ade\u00adves that we need to have a dee\u00adper unders\u00adtan\u00adding of the com\u00adpo\u00adnents that are making up our world. We need to have a dee\u00adper unders\u00adtan\u00adding becau\u00adse when we do, we are able to sha\u00adpe the objects we use ins\u00adte\u00adad of tho\u00adse objects sha\u00adping use. Beyond being savvy con\u00adsu\u00admers, by del\u00adving into tin\u00adke\u00adring, we open the doors to inno\u00adva\u00adti\u00adon. From moun\u00adtain bikes to air\u00adpla\u00adnes, semi-con\u00adduc\u00adtors to com\u00adpu\u00adters, his\u00adtory has repe\u00ada\u00adte\u00addly shown that it\u2019s been the ama\u00adteurs who have been the sig\u00adni\u00adfi\u00adcant inven\u00adtors and impro\u00advers of the&nbsp;world.<\/p>\n<p>To bols\u00adter the tin\u00adke\u00adrers\u2019 abi\u00adlity to cre\u00ada\u00adte, Cata\u00adri\u00adna co-foun\u00added&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/openmaterials.org\/\">openmaterials.org<\/a>, a web\u00adsi\u00adte whe\u00adre peo\u00adple publish infor\u00adma\u00adti\u00adon and aggre\u00adga\u00adte rese\u00adar\u00adch, papers, and tuto\u00adri\u00adals by other makers.
