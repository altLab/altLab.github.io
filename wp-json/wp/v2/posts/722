Who cares about what is a fish saying to the other or even if he\u2019s com\u00adplai\u00adning or phi\u00adlo\u00adsophi\u00adzing alo\u00adne? The pro\u00adject doesn\u2019t intend to put fishes tal\u00adking but ins\u00adte\u00adad to use their acti\u00adons to dump ran\u00addom mes\u00adsa\u00adges to twit\u00adter. This work plays with the metaphor of the glass hou\u00adse and obser\u00adves this very own moment of soci\u00adal networks incrustation.<!--more--><\/p>\n<p>In order to deve\u00adlop this work, an impro\u00advi\u00adsed struc\u00adtu\u00adre was built using some objects avai\u00adla\u00adble in he kit\u00adchen and all over the resi\u00adden\u00adce spa\u00adce to track 2 fishes insi\u00adde the aqua\u00adrium. The com\u00adpu\u00adter visi\u00adon setup was made using 2 came\u00adras and valu\u00ades of x and y of each blob (fish) were avai\u00adla\u00adble to cal\u00adcu\u00adla\u00adte the dis\u00adtan\u00adce betwe\u00aden them, When a mini\u00admum dis\u00adtan\u00adce value  was rea\u00adched a ran\u00addom mes\u00adsa\u00adge was sent to twit\u00adter pro\u00adfi\u00adles, Bloop_a and Bloop_b, upda\u00adting its sta\u00adtus. A dif\u00adfe\u00adrent pers\u00adpec\u00adti\u00adve of the work using two fishes was also deve\u00adlop but this time with the intent to cre\u00ada\u00adte a fake per\u00adso\u00adnal pro\u00adfi\u00adle. Here an algo\u00adrithm sear\u00adchs all over twit\u00adter for mes\u00adsa\u00adges with cer\u00adtain key words and post them into fake pro\u00adfi\u00adles con\u00adtrol\u00adled by fishes inte\u00adrac\u00adti\u00adons. Thus, each pro\u00adfi\u00adle pre\u00adsents a line of inte\u00adrest and shows up as if some per\u00adson could be behind it.<\/p>\n<p>In the first two days I was dedi\u00adca\u00adted to com\u00adpu\u00adter visi\u00adon issu\u00ades and also to the com\u00admu\u00adni\u00adca\u00adti\u00adon betwe\u00aden pro\u00adces\u00adsing and twit\u00adter. For the second perspective\/project I was coding a small rou\u00adti\u00adne in order to com\u00admu\u00adni\u00adca\u00adte with twit\u00adter api, sear\u00adch for tags and upda\u00adte each pro\u00adfi\u00adle sta\u00adtus.

In order to cre\u00ada\u00adte a good envi\u00adron\u00adment for them, I ran over local shops sear\u00adching for a new aqua\u00adrium and water tre\u00adat\u00adment pro\u00adducts. This task took a lot of time, not becau\u00adse we were in Alen\u00adte\u00adjo but becau\u00adse new ide\u00adas arri\u00adved within group inte\u00adrac\u00adti\u00adon and new mate\u00adri\u00adal needs came to com\u00adpli\u00adca\u00adte more the situation.<\/p>\n<p>By the end of the week, a team for\u00admed by me, Ricar\u00addo Lobo and Mau\u00adri\u00adcio wor\u00adked har\u00addly on the Pia\u00adno Cock\u00adtail, an ori\u00adgi\u00adnal idea by Boris Vian .
